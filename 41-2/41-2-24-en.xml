              <ParaText id="3482838">Today there are basically two issues we hope Canadians will reflect on in this House and pronounce on later this evening. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482839">The first is the role of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office, the senior advisers to the Prime Minister, in a potentially criminal cover-up and a series of events, which the RCMP believes, in fact, have violated three sections of the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482840">The second issue is the role of senior Conservative operatives and senior Conservative senators in participating in a whitewash of a Senate report in attempting to influence an independent audit being conducted by a national auditing firm.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482841">We think Canadians, increasingly, do not believe the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and do not believe his constantly changing version of these events. That is why we think it is important to have this discussion in the House of Commons today. I hope that colleagues will agree with us tonight, in a vote, that the only solution is for the Prime Minister to, in fact, come clean, under oath, and explain to Canadians the exact extent to which he was informed of many of these details.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3482842">The real problem here, apart from the fact that the RCMP believes that criminal activity took place in the Prime Minister's Office, is that not only are there multiple versions of the facts in terms of the degree of the Prime Minister's involvement, but the versions put forward by the RCMP and by this government demonstrate that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his staff acted inappropriately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482843">It has become clear that Canadians no longer believe the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> when he tells his changing version of this sordid affair. In fact, the person who is undermining the Prime Minister's credibility the most is the Prime Minister himself, because he has given us so many different versions. His story keeps changing. Every time, new details are made public. We are at the point where people are doubting what the Prime Minister of Canada is saying.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3482844">On the one side, we have email correspondence from Nigel Wright, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s chief of staff, highlighted in a sworn affidavit from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and presented to a judge. Let us look at the first email. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482845">On February 22, Nigel Wright states that Mike Duffy would be made whole through the use of Conservative Party money, but at the end, Nigel Wright wanted to “speak to the PM before everything is considered final. Less than an hour later, according to an RCMP sworn affidavit, Nigel Wright sent a further email saying, “We are good to go from the PM”. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3482846">The inference here is very clear: Nigel Wright confirmed the details of the agreement to pay back Mike Duffy with the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482847">I would very much like to give the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> the benefit of the doubt when he claims that Nigel Wright did not tell him the details of the agreement. However, Nigel Wright has been very clear. At that time, the agreement was in fact to use Conservative Party funds to pay back Mike Duffy's inappropriate expense claims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482848">It is ridiculous to suggest that Mr. Wright needed the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s approval to ask Mike Duffy to pay back his fraudulent expense claims with his own money. Quire frankly, this story borders on the ridiculous.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3482849">The determining factor in an illegal act such as the ones the RCMP believes took place in the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office is not only who gave the corrupt money and when but that such a transfer ultimately took place. The Prime Minister's problem here is that all indications, all the circumstantial evidence, point to his knowing and approving of at least a $32,000 payment to Senator Duffy, plus his legal fees. These funds were originally going to come from the Conservative Party through the hands of Senator Irving Gerstein, who was a senior Conservative member of the caucus and chairman of the Conservative fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482850">It does not matter, in the end, that the source of funds changed and that the amount increased. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> appears to have approved a plan to corrupt a sitting legislator, and that is the essential element of how this whole sordid affair began. That allegation has met with no credible defence from the government spokespersons, and the RCMP, in its sworn affidavit, tells a very compelling story to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482851">Indeed, the RCMP affidavit paints a clear and compelling story of a widespread and directed cover-up at the senior levels of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office, including senior members of the Conservative caucus in the Senate and a woman who, at the time, was a senior Conservative cabinet minister. The RCMP believes that in the totality of the evidence, these actions and the subsequent attempt to cover up these actions constituted a violation of at least three sections of Canada's Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3482852">Even if we believe the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> when he says that Nigel Wright told him nothing and that he was never informed of the Mike Duffy repayment scheme; of the whitewashing of the Senate report, which was ordered by his own office; or of the involvement of four senators in his inner circle—even if we decide to believe all of the excuses, each more ridiculous than the last—there is still a serious problem. This government chose to protect the individuals who were involved in this possibly criminal scheme instead of adequately disciplining them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482853">I want to share a few of the most blatant examples. Some of these people are still Conservative senators and others were directly employed by the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada before being promoted to the highest echelons of Conservative ministerial offices.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3482854">Let us start with the Conservative senators. Four of them, senators LeBreton, Carolyn Stewart Olsen, David Tkachuk and Irving Gerstein, were interviewed by the RCMP in regard to their role in the Conservative scheme to whitewash a Senate report that was supposed to be, originally, critical of Senator Duffy's behaviour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482855">Indeed the RCMP have found, in sworn affidavits, that these Conservative senators were less than truthful when they were interviewed by Canada's national police force. Senator Marjory LeBreton was a senior member of the Conservative cabinet in the current <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s government. She was a key architect in the government plan to whitewash the Senate audit and participated actively and directly in an effort to sweep the whole mess under the carpet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482856">She presided over an effort in the Senate to potentially hide criminal acts, and for that she has been rewarded by remaining on the internal economy committee of the Senate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482857">Senator Carolyn Stewart Olsen really did the heavy lifting in the effort to whitewash the Senate report. She in fact moved to strip sections out of the draft report that were critical of Senator Duffy's spending. She was an architect of the deal to go easy on Senator Duffy, as was negotiated between the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s lawyer, Mr. Perrin, and Mr. Duffy's counsel, Ms. Payne. She was found, herself, to have been less than truthful in her discussions, in her interview with the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482858">For a government that pretends over and over again that it is co-operating fully with the RCMP in this investigation, maybe it should start by suggesting to the senior members of its caucus, as well as Senator Stewart Olsen, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s former press secretary, that they in fact be truthful when they are interviewed by the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482859">Some will remember Senator David Tkachuk as having been involved in the scandal concerning spending in the Saskatchewan legislature. Senator Tkachuk played another critical role. He was chair of the internal economy committee. He subsequently resigned. Canadians will remember that Senator Tkachuk was briefed by Deloitte in a verbal presentation on the progress of its audit.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3482860">It was a private meeting. Three senators were present. The auditors came to give a preliminary report on their findings. Deloitte had found that Senator Duffy was claiming per diem allocations from taxpayers in Ottawa at a time when his cellphone records indicated he was in Florida, and what did Senator Tkachuk do? He picked up the phone and called Senator Duffy and told him he had better come up with some explanation as to why he was claiming per diems in Ottawa when in fact he was in Florida.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482861">Ever compliant, their favourite senator, Senator Duffy then sent a phony letter to Senator Tkachuk referring to a conversation they had two evenings previously and saying he had reviewed his records and in fact there was a clerical error in his office as to why taxpayers were paying per diems for his work in Ottawa when he was in Florida.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482862">Senator Tkachuk had an obligation to taxpayers to protect taxpayers' hard-earned dollars, not to call a colleague who is under investigation in a forensic audit and tip him off. That would be like a judge who meets with the police before granting a search warrant, and the minute the police leave his or her office, the judge picks up the phone and says to the target of the search warrant: “Look you'd better get rid of the evidence, because the police are on their way over”. That makes no sense at all. That was what Senator Tkachuk did, and he too has been rewarded for his good work by continuing to serve on the internal economy committee of the senate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482863">Canadians will know Senator Irving Gerstein as a senior Conservative fundraiser, the chair of the Conservative fund. Surprisingly, he felt it appropriate to pick up the phone, on instructions from the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office as we have learned from the RCMP affidavit, and call Deloitte, a reputable national auditing firm, to try to put pressure on it to say that if Mike Duffy reimbursed the money they could just sort of call it kiff and forget about Senator Duffy and the audit. He asked how that might work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482864">Senator Gerstein is not a member of that committee. He was not involved in the audit function in the Senate at all, but presumably he has a relationship with senior officials at the accounting firm. It might be because it has done $50 million worth of work for the Government of Canada in recent years; that could be. I see my colleague, the NDP House leader, may agree with me that it might in fact be one of the reasons Senator Gerstein felt it was appropriate to just pick up the phone and say, “Look, can we just forget about this?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482865">That constitutes a huge breach of professional ethics on the part of Senator Gerstein. It is inexplicable why the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office would instruct people to contact an independent audit firm. I am very pleased that the Senate internal economy committee, inspired by an intervention from the Liberal Party, will in fact be calling Deloitte before the Senate committee later this week to explain exactly how and by whom they were contacted, when senior Conservative operators called attempting to whitewash an audit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482866">Senator Gerstein was also willing to pay $32,000 to reimburse Mike Duffy for his potentially fraudulent expenses. As we know from the RCMP audit, Senator Gerstein certainly did not worry about the propriety of potentially trying to corrupt and bribe a sitting legislator. His concern was with the quantum. His concern was with the amount of money involved, and he was willing to take $32,000 of contributions that Canadians made of their personal money to the Conservative Party and flush it to Mike Duffy to try to make a problem go away for the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and for Mr. Wright, but at the end he decided that the amount was too much; and then Nigel Wright entered with a bag of money.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3482867">Now let us take a look at the steps taken by the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s employees, those who played some sort of role in this sordid affair and who still work for the Conservative Party and the Canadian government, namely Chris Woodcock, David Van Hammen, Patrick Rogers and Ray Novak. I want to look at what they knew, when they knew it, and what the Prime Minister did for his own employees who were responsible for this scheme.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482868">I will start with Mr. Woodcock. He was director of issues management in the PMO. In other words, if there was a fire, it was up to Chris Woodcock to put it out. RCMP documents show that he participated in whitewashing the Senate report and, what is worse, Nigel Wright sent him an email on March 8 to inform him that Mike Duffy would be receiving a $90,000 cheque from Nigel Wright's personal bank account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482869">Rather than informing the police or perhaps even calling a lawyer, what did he do? Clearly, he could not call the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s lawyer in the Prime Minister's Office, because we are well aware that Mr. Perrin was also involved. Instead, Mr. Woodcock helped to do more to cover up the scandal. In the private sector, he would have been fired and the police would have been called. As a member of the Conservative Party, he became the chief of staff to the <Affiliation DbId="170686" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482870">David van Hemmen was Mr. Wright's executive assistant in the Prime Minister's Office. Not only was he aware of the illegal plan to pay back Mr. Duffy, but he also helped to transfer the funds. He took the cheque to the bank of Mr. Duffy's lawyer. He was aware enough of what was going on to be in possession of that cheque, which the RCMP described as key evidence of corruption. Once again, what was his punishment? He was promoted to the position of policy advisor to the <Affiliation DbId="165140" Type="4">Minister of State for Finance</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482871">Patrick Rogers was the director of parliamentary affairs in the PMO. According to the RCMP, he and Senator Gerstein were involved in trying to put an end to the Deloitte audit in order to protect Mike Duffy. Mr. Rogers also had dealings with Senator Tkachuk and Senator Stewart Olsen, who whitewashed the Senate report about Mike Duffy by removing any criticisms of his behaviour. What happened to Mr. Rogers as a result of this unacceptable behaviour? He is now the director of policy for the <Affiliation DbId="194612" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Heritage</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482872">Finally, let us talk about Ray Novak, who was the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s deputy chief of staff. We know two things about Ray Novak. He knew enough about this sordid affair to call Mike Duffy a serial liar, and he worked on the Senate file with Senator LeBreton. If we are thinking about accepting that the Prime Minister knew nothing about what was happening—and that is a big if—then clearly Ray Novak knew much more and he never shared that information with the Prime Minister. What was his sentence? Ray Novak replaced Nigel Wright as the Prime Minister's chief of staff.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482873">Canadians have the right to wonder how the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> can trust Ray Novak to be his chief of staff. Why replace a chief of staff who, according to the Prime Minister himself, misled his boss with another person who allegedly did the same thing? </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3482874">The concept is very simple. At the end of the day, in the private sector, if any chief executive officer presided over such chaotic behaviour from his or her senior staff, or if any board of directors was faced with a chief executive officer who the RCMP, in sworn affidavits, knew presided over an operation that may have violated three very serious sections of Canada's Criminal Code, that chief executive officer would have been shown the door. That chief executive officer would not have then promoted all the incompetent and deceitful staff who participated under his watch in what may in fact be a criminal conspiracy to subvert three important sections of the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482875">In his own guide for ministers and ministers of state, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> outlined what ministerial responsibility allegedly should be. If one hires all the players, then one is responsible ultimately for their behaviour. The current Prime Minister is not living up to his own standard of responsibility, and Canadians are increasingly distrustful and disbelieving of the words of the Prime Minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482876">The government's stories and answers make no sense at all: Mr. Wright was a great Canadian; then, all of a sudden, he accepted full responsibility and resigned; then, suddenly, we find out that he was fired.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482877">The idea that he took sole responsibility for a criminal act has no basis at all in law. If a group of people conspire to violate the Criminal Code, it really is not acceptable at the end of the day if one of them says, “You know what, let me take the blame on this one and then you guys will owe me something down the line”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482878">That basis has absolutely no credibility, and Canadians are increasingly distrustful of a government that has lost its moral compass and simply is unable to tell the truth in the face of this very serious scandal.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3482879">Mr. Speaker, I am shocked and appalled that no Conservatives wanted to get up today and refute any of the claims that my friend from the Liberal Party has made. It is remarkable because this is a scandal that goes right to the very heart of the Conservative Party and the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. Yet they remain silent and remain in their seats, perhaps because they do not have a lot to say on this scandal, which has gripped the country for the last number of months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482880">I have two points and a question for my friend.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482881">There appears to be two consistent themes in the story and narrative he described today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482882">The first is that every character involved in this play, every actor he mentioned who has been at the heart of this corruption scandal, are intimately tied to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. They are personally connected to the Prime Minister and to his judgment. He appointed them all. They were confidants. In many cases, they were friends. He trusted them implicitly. It calls into question the Prime Minister's judgment and the culture that has been created in the Prime Minister's very own office, which the RCMP are now investigating. By the way, the Prime Minister claims that there is no RCMP investigation into his office. Rather, the RCMP are just interviewing everyone in the Prime Minister's Office about an illegal affair but that is not an investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482883">Second, and this is where my friend might diverge a bit, there is also a consistent theme that everyone involved on the Senate side of this scandal has virtually no accountability. The interactions he talks about between the head of the investigating committee, the board of internal economy, the auditors and Mike Duffy, from Stewart Olsen, LeBreton and everyone down the line, the reason they can act that way, act with such incredible ease with the law and any ethical guidelines, is that there is no accounting. They simply know they are there by the will of a prime minister or a previous prime minister and there is no day of reckoning with the Canadian public. At the heart of this scandal, is there not also a call for fundamental reform if not outright abolishment? The Senate itself, by its very DNA, its very nature, encourages this kind of behaviour to go on and be rampant, like the old boys' club. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482884">Are there not those two consistent themes in the narrative the member has woven today?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3482885">Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and NDP counterpart, the <Affiliation DbId="182412" Type="7">House Leader of the Official Opposition</Affiliation>, for his question.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3482886">I agree with my colleague that the Conservatives are remaining silent. That is probably because the incessant talking points that are cranked out in the Prime Minister's Office really have nothing to say in the face of RCMP sworn affidavits given to a criminal court judge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482887">It is increasingly difficult, even for the great talent in the Prime Minister's Office, to fabricate talking points that Conservative members can get up and repeat in the House. I would suspect as the debate unfolds today that there will be very few Conservatives who will want to participate in the debate and very few who will be able to defend the actions of their own leader, as we have seen in media reports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482888">I agree with my colleague that the characters in this cover-up, whom we have called the “fraud squad” and the “dirty dozen”, the different people who were intimately involved both in the potentially criminal acts and the three Criminal Code violations identified so far by the RCMP, were intimately tied to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. He selected those people. He appointed some of them to the Senate. He has continued to give them immense responsibility in his office. However, when the heat came on, obviously he was unable to fire all of them, maybe because they knew too much, so they were sort of shifted laterally and then up a bit. They probably received pay raises by assuming senior positions in the offices of Conservative cabinet ministers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482889">I would also agree with my colleague that there needs to be full accountability in the Senate. Ultimately, we may disagree on the disposition of the upper chamber, but I think there is no disagreement whatsoever on the idea that the senators need to be fully accountable and that those who behaved in a way that the RCMP said was less than truthful in interviews with the police should also face consequences. I think that when the police finally get access to those emails and correspondence the list of people potentially charged in this criminal conspiracy will grow and we may very well see Conservative senators facing criminal charges as well.</ParaText>

However, there is another section of the Criminal Code that relates directly to criminal conspiracy, another word that was used by my friend. Paragraph 465(1)(c) essentially says that anyone who conspires with someone to commit an indictable offence is themselves guilty of an indictable offence and subject to the same punishment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482892">He alluded to Senators Gerstein, LeBreton, Tkachuk and Stewart Olsen. I wonder then, if the good member might opine on his thoughts on the violation of section 465(1)(c)?</ParaText>

Obviously, when we are talking about complicated legal matters and the Criminal Code, the opinion from my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170547" Type="2">Guelph</Affiliation> carries great experience and great weight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482894">I would agree with him when he correctly focused on section 465(1)(c) of the Criminal Code. You, yourself, Mr. Speaker, were a senior lawyer in the great city of Windsor. I am sure you have reviewed the Criminal Code many times in your law practice. Clients would colloquially refer to that as the aiding and abetting section. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482895">Everyone understands that if two or three people get together to rob a bank and a couple of guys go in with face masks and weapons while the other guy is waiting outside in the car, the guy in the car is as guilty of participating in the criminal act of robbing the bank as the two people who showed up in the bank with the weapons and balaclavas. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482896">In this case, the people wearing the balaclavas were a senior group of operatives in the Prime Minister's Office. They were the ones who were part of what we believe, and the RCMP may ultimately believe, a crown prosecutor may ultimately conclude and a criminal court may ultimately find, to have been a criminal conspiracy. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3482900">Mr. Speaker, I would agree with one aspect of what the <Affiliation DbId="194836" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> said and disagree with perhaps another aspect. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482901">He said he is not sure that this is a priority of the Canadian people.

              <ParaText id="3482903">We agree that the behaviour of these four senators was clearly inappropriate. In fact, the RCMP believe, and may conclude, that it warrants criminal charges. There has to be and should always be a very robust accountability for persons who are spending taxpayers' dollars. Certainly one of the Conservative senators involved did not think he had to reimburse expenses himself because someone in the Prime Minister's Office would make him whole with a large cheque. Taxpayers may have been reimbursed, but it was certainly not by the offending senator. He was reimbursed by the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s senior adviser.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3482904">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to rise on this. The hon. member from the Liberal Party touched on the by-election results last night. I want to take a very brief moment to congratulate the two newest members of the Conservative caucus who will be coming to the House very soon. I want to congratulate all those who ran. It is never easy running for an election. It is certainly not easy in a by-election, running when a candidate is left alone and the focus of the world is on other areas, but again, congratulations to the newest Conservative members and congratulations to all members who ran and who were victorious last night.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482905">I will start by continuing along with the question I asked of the member opposite. All Canadians have been very saddened by the behaviour they have seen by a number of senators. The vast majority of Canadians expect that when they elect members of Parliament or when individuals are elevated to the Senate, they will do their best to use the money that Canadian taxpayers provide them to do their job. They expect the senators will do their best to use that money in a respectful way, in a way that respects the taxpayers. When Canadians see that does not happen, they rightfully demand that action be taken.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482906">As others have tried to do, I will not defend the actions of these senators, because I think they are very indefensible. We have seen throughout this debate the need to have significant reforms in the Senate. This government has been trying to do so for a number of years. We have brought forward legislation that is right now being debated in the Supreme Court of Canada because we want to have a road map for the reform of the Senate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482907">Canadians at the same time have said that they want a reformed Senate. They want a Senate that they can once again be proud of, but at the same time, they do not want to see the attention of the elected members of Parliament be turned toward constitutional battles that would take us away from what should be the main focus of government, creating jobs and opportunity and hope for Canadians across this country. That is why we have put forward a number of reforms to the Supreme Court, which we hope will again provide us with a road map for going forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482908">I note also that the Senate did take some steps last June to improve accountability measures in the Senate. It was unfortunate, and I hear this often in my constituency, that it took them so long. Why did it take so long for the Senate to catch up with the House of Commons with respect to accountability and how their expenses are being handled? I wish I had the answer to that, and perhaps had these measures been undertaken earlier by the Senate, the senators would not be in the position they find themselves now.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3482924">That is the Liberal approach to something as serious as the income trust. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482925">The decision on whether the government was going to tax income trusts or not would have had a massive impact on the market. We would have seen the market move.

              <ParaText id="3482926">It would appear on the surface that when the member for <Affiliation DbId="170626" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation> was telling a person at the CIBC that he would be happier very soon, the day before this would be released to the public, I am making the assumption that he was actually letting him on the fact that the member for <Affiliation DbId="170466" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation>, who was then the finance minster, was about to make a decision on the income trusts that would make this person at the CIBC happier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482927">What appears to have happened here is that the member for <Affiliation DbId="170466" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation> informed the member for <Affiliation DbId="170626" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation>, who then informed somebody at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. Forgetting about cabinet secrecy, what they seem to have done is to try to find a way to positively influence the people who were at that time donating massive amounts to the Liberal Party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482928"> As members will recall, one of the first acts of this government was the Federal Accountability Act, which removed the influence of big money and big unions from banks. Then when they went on a little further to investigate, apparently he had no email. He did not have a BlackBerry, nothing of the sort.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482929">I contrast that to our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. The moment he found out, the moment he was informed that there might be problems within his office, he immediately goes back. His staff is asked to sign waivers so that they could appropriately assist in the RCMP investigation. Hundreds of thousands of emails are turned over. Everything that the RCMP is asking for is provided to them so that they can assist in this investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482930">In addition, talking a bit further about some of the hypocrisy of the Liberal Party, this is apparently a priority. It is a priority for the Liberals. I am going to say, and we will disagree on this, that the economy is a priority for Canadians. I think jobs and opportunities are priorities for Canadians. I think public safety is a priority for Canadians. I think resource development is a priority for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482931">Apparently the Liberals have a different philosophy. They think that is important. It is such a priority that the Liberal leader sits down every day in this House and is not allowed to talk about other things. It seems that it is not important enough for the Liberal leader to come into the House and talk about these issues. It is not important enough for him to come and ask the questions that he deems to be the most important questions of the day. He does not do it. He sends another person, a surrogate, to do it and to ask those questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482932">As I said before in another debate we had, while I disagree that this is the absolute priority of Canadians, it is a priority of at least one of the two opposition parties. On a daily basis the <Affiliation DbId="181199" Type="96">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> shows up in the House and asks questions. It is every single day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482933">Every single day the <Affiliation DbId="181199" Type="96">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> asks questions, because he says it is a priority, and I assume it is a priority because he shows up and asks those questions. I may disagree. I might not like the questions he is asking and I know he does not like the answers I am giving back, but at least he is somewhat consistent in that he is making it a priority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482934">That is in contrast to most of the Liberal Party members, who when a camera might be on or when they think they might be able to score a cheap political point, will rise in their place and try to make a point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482935">We also have the leader of the Liberal Party, who gets up and says, “Oh, I am Mr. Positive. I am Mr. Happy”, but then he gets somebody else to get up and make slanders and slurs against either the official opposition or the government. He is neither accountable nor honest in how he deals with the Canadian people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482936">More and more, every single day, Canadians are coming to the same conclusion that we did a long time ago: that this is a person who is in way over his head. His inability to speak to motions that he deems to be the most important to Canadians reflects either his lack of trust in the parliamentary process or his inability to actually back up the things that he is saying with evidence.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3482937">There has been a lot of discussion with respect to the actions of Mr. Wright and why, on February 22, there was an email that seems to have caused a bit of grief. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482938">These documents are a very impressive body of work, and I congratulate the RCMP. However, people are asking why the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> would need to tell Senator Duffy to repay his expenses. As I said in the House yesterday, on February 7 Senator Duffy defended himself, saying that his expenses were perfectly fine. On February 11 Senator Duffy again tried to defend the fact that he had claimed these inappropriate expenses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482939">On February 13 he approached the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, again trying to justify these inappropriate expenses, and the Prime Minister told him he had to repay them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482940">On February 19 Senator Duffy tried to defend his inappropriate expenses. On February 20 Senator Duffy tried to defend his inappropriate expenses. On February 21 Senator Duffy tried to defend his inappropriate expenses. At no point did the senator ever agree that he had to repay them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482941">As I have also said on a number of occasions, just because someone can find a way around the rules does not mean that he or she should find a way around the rules. There is the spirit of the law, as the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has said, and there is the letter of the law. When these rules are put in place, we do not envision members of Parliament or senators finding all kinds of convenient ways around the rules and justifying them. Canadians give us a lot of money to be here, they provide us with a lot of resources to be here, and they are fair in what they give us, but they also want to be treated fairly. Part of being treated fairly is not finding a way to scam or get around the rules. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482942">Therefore, when Senator Duffy came to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> on February 13, the Prime Minister said to repay the expenses, despite the fact that the senator, on February 7, 11, 12, 13, 19, 20, and 21 was still objecting to the fact that he had to pay. Finally, on February 22, it appeared that he was going to repay them. Of course, we have all learned that such was not the fact, that he had somebody else repay those expenses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482943">That, at its core, is what this investigation by the police is about right now. It is about the fact that Senator Duffy claimed expenses that he did not incur and that it was made worse by the fact that Nigel Wright repaid those expenses on his behalf. As I have said countless times—and if people read this, it is quite evident—Nigel Wright said he is prepared to accept the consequences of the decisions that he made. He is working also, it would appear, with the RCMP on this matter. However, despite his pronouncements in the Senate a number of weeks ago, Senator Duffy is in no way co-operating with this investigation. He said he would turn over lots of emails, but every time he is asked, he finds a reason he cannot turn them over.</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482946">The RCMP, after reviewing thousands of emails and documents, has come to that conclusion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482947">Nigel Wright has also said that he did not bring the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> into his confidence with respect to this matter. Therefore, it is very clear that the Prime Minister did not know. Had he known, he would have put a stop to it. What Nigel Wright did was inappropriate. It should not have happened, and he should suffer the consequences of that decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482948">Ultimately, what Senator Duffy, Senator Mac Harb, Senator Brazeau, and Senator Wallin did is something that all Canadians are infuriated with, and rightly so. In addition to working with the RCMP, that is one of the reasons that we have to move forward as a Parliament with substantial reform to the Senate.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="00">(1100)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3482949"> On all these matters, it is very clear that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has shown leadership, he has worked with the RCMP, has been open and honest and that he, just as badly as everybody else, wants to see the conclusion of this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482950"> As we have said on a number of occasions, we will continue to govern for all Canadians. We have an incredible record of some 61 bills, and 19 private member's bills that have been passed. We have a very impressive record that I know a majority of Canadians look at everyday and are very proud of. That is why I am so proud to work with the Prime Minister.</ParaText>

He is left in the position where, out of that vast Conservative caucus, only two members get up to defend the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>: the Prime Minister and his parliamentary secretary. It is a sad state of affairs for which he is not responsible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482960">However, my question has to do with income trusts. I cannot believe he would talk about the subject of income trusts, which brings such huge discredit to his leader and his party. The allegations he mentions against two of my colleagues were totally unfounded. It happened some eight years ago. No charges were ever laid, so it is completely baseless.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482961"> The reality is that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, during the election campaign of 2005-06, promised repeatedly there would be no tax on income trusts. Then what did he do on that black Halloween day of 2006? He changed his mind. He raised taxes on income trusts to the point where hundreds of thousands of Canadians lost hundreds of millions of dollars overnight, turning many former Conservatives into non-Conservatives. It was a total breaking of a solemn commitment made by the Prime Minister, leading to massive losses by millions of hard-saving Canadians, who have, in many cases, not recovered from that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3482966">I think the only people who are turning away are the people who used to vote for the Liberals. They are turning to other parties.

              <ParaText id="3482986">Nigel Wright contacts Benjamin Perrin and they talk about setting up this story for Mike Duffy, the media lines for Mike Duffy. Nigel Wright says to Mr. Perrin that he does not like the optics of sending lines to a lawyer and wants to do it over the phone. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482987">Now if this was a legal agreement, an honourable agreement, is it something that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> would support? Why would they not want to put the deal in writing? However, no, they did not want to talk to the lawyer, but tell Duffy over the phone. This is the lawyer for the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> being involved in this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482988">On February 21, we found out that Benjamin Perrin, the personal lawyer to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of the country, came back with a five-point deal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482989">The first was to kill the audit and say that Duffy's expenses were okay. Now the audit is on whether or not Mike Duffy had defrauded the taxpayers of Canada. Therefore, the first thing they would do is kill that audit and say that Mike Duffy did not defraud the people of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482990">The second was that Duffy meet the requirements for residency. Well, they knew he did not because, as Chris Woodcock says, “Describing Duffy's arrangements in Charlottetown as a ‘residence’ may be too cute…I’ll cross that line out”. However. they were going to pretend that Duffy's summer place was his residency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482991">The third, and this is the key element, was that his expenses stemmed from his time on the road working for the party and that his legal fees would be reimbursed and he would be kept whole. As the RCMP tells us, financially, Mike Duffy will not be out of pocket. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482992">The fourth, the old Duffster, if they changed the rules back, he would like to be able to claim his P.E.I. residence again and start scamming the taxpayers one more time, but that was in the deal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482993">The fifth was that the Prime Minister's Office would take all reasonable steps to ensure the Conservative caucus would stick to the media lines. This meant that nobody was going to bad mouth the Duffster.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482994">Therefore, Benjamin Perrin writes back that they have negotiated this deal. Once again, who is Benjamin Perrin negotiating this deal from?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3482995">Then Nigel Wright said to him, “I now have the go-ahead on point three, with a couple of stipulations”. The go-ahead is that they are going to pay Mike Duffy's expenses and pretend that he paid them back. Who gave the go-ahead, with the stipulations? Are we to assume that the phantom <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was not the one they had to get the go-ahead from?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482996"> Later on that day, as the negotiations go back and forth, they go back and say that they need the final word from the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> before this deal is okayed. The Prime Minister's own lawyer has laid out a deal, which we now see is under investigation for fraud and breach of trust. Then they say that they have the okay. “We are good to go”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482997">How can the Canadian public be expected to believe that a lawyer as important as Mr. Perrin, with all the professional and legal obligations he has, would have been involved in the negotiations on his own, would have misrepresented those negotiations to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, would have argued with some fictitious person in the Prime Minister's chair about the stipulation on point number three that they were going to cover off, through the Conservative Party, Mike Duffy's expenses, and would have then turned around and said that he did not know a thing about this and further that he never bothered to tell the Prime Minister? I would find that very surprising for a man of integrity and for a man with the professional and legal responsibilities Mr. Perrin has. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482998">The other interesting point here is that Senator Duffy's lawyer wanted the agreement in writing, and Mr. Perrin did not want to put it in writing. He says, “we aren't selling a car here”. It sounds like we are reading <I>Goodfellas</I>. This is the lawyer for the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of the country saying that we are not selling a car here; we are not putting it in writing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3482999">This deal is about transferring money from the Conservative Party, whitewashing an audit, and claiming that a man who is not eligible to sit in the Senate meets the constitutional requirements, and doing all of this but not putting it in writing. Again, who is Mr. Perrin, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s lawyer, representing when he says that they are not selling a car? One has to sign a big legal agreement to sell a car, but they would set up a potentially illegal deal in the Prime Minister's Office, not put it in writing, and not tell the Prime Minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483000">We know that the deal goes off the rails on February 27, when poor Nigel Wright is gobsmacked to find out that Mike Duffy has scammed so much money that instead of the $30,000, it is $90,000. Senator Gerstein balks at this point and walks. Nigel Wright is in a pickle, and for whatever bizarre reason, he agrees to cut the cheque himself so that the deal stays in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483001">Then we go back again to the lawyer for the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of this country, Mr. Benjamin Perrin. On page five of the RCMP's affidavit it says: </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483002">

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Nigel Wright decided that he would personally cover the cost of reimbursing Senator Duffy.

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483003">Benjamin Perrin told us on May 21 that he was not consulted on and had not participated in Nigel Wright's decision to write a personal cheque to reimburse Senator Duffy's expenses, and further, he had never communicated with the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> on this matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483004">What we are seeing in this scandal is that a cover-up was orchestrated in the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office. We have named the names of the senators who were involved in attempting to whitewash the audit, including the call from Wright to Gerstein and from Gerstein to Michael Runia at Deloitte, a friend of his, to try to whitewash an audit. What does whitewashing an audit mean? The audit was about whether Mike Duffy defrauded the people of Canada of $90,000 and had set up a housing scheme to collect the per diems. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483005">We see Senator Tkachuk and Senator Stewart-Olsen involved. We see Senator LeBreton and Senator Gerstein. All of them have acted shamefully, but within the office of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, there were two key people: Nigel Wright, the chief of staff, and Benjamin Perrin, the lawyer for the Prime Minister. How can we believe that nobody told the Prime Minister when, on February 22, they were needing the go-ahead on point three. Point three is about coming up with a scheme to pay Mike Duffy to make him shut up and make the problem go away.</ParaText>

The government told the veterans that they would close all their points of contact and that they would be kicked out without being given a pension. That is the attitude of the Conservatives.

              <ParaText id="3483012">This is about corruption.

              <ParaText id="3483018">Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague and I do not agree on much. However, I think he would agree that when we are in the House, members are considered to be under oath. Otherwise, we are in contempt of Parliament. Therefore, when we have a motion that states that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> should speak under oath, the Prime Minister, as much as I disagree with him, has shown up.

              <ParaText id="3483022">Mr. Speaker, I will not say that I am honoured to discuss such a subject, because I am very depressed at having to rise to speak again about scandals. The particular scandal we are discussing could be the plot in a John Grisham novel, and I would not be surprised if it were outright fiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483023">For several weeks now, if not months, we have been pounded by all kinds of speeches. This motion from the Liberal opposition calls for the actions of the Prime Minister's Office to be condemned and for the Prime Minister to testify in committee under oath, among other things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483024">I agree with my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170184" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> that we all swore an oath here, before even entering the House, when we were elected as members of Parliament. I hope that when we speak, we do so under oath.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483025">The Liberal leader seemed to suggest that having the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> testify under oath somewhere would change something, but I do not agree. However, it would be interesting to look into this issue in committee and ask the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> all kinds of questions. Again, I highly doubt this will change anything at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483026">I say this with unimaginable sadness. The <Affiliation DbId="194836" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister</Affiliation> is doing his job, but I still think he is being thrown to the lions. He is trying to handle things as well as he can. Clearly he is in no way involved in this scandal, but he was chosen to play this role and to lend some credibility to the whole affair. It is rather unfortunate for him that he has to do this, although it does give him an opportunity to exercise some of his natural talents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483027">That said, if he thinks that this is not a concern for Canadians, then he is just a little too busy with this issue and too focused on learning his lines. He would find it useful to visit his riding and talk to his constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483028">When I go to Gatineau, all that people have to say is, “Don't let up on the Senate.” Seriously, this is what people most often say to me. The reason for that is that Canadians, including the people of Quebec and Gatineau, are fed up with being taken for fools. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483029">We, too, feel that their version of the story is changing little by little. This is not a minor matter. This situation concerns an extremely important institution, one that has gained great importance in recent years. Whether the government is Liberal or Conservative, power has become increasingly concentrated in the PMO. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483030">No one in government can speak or even sneeze without the PMO's prior permission, and this is a good indication of how much power that office wields. When a scandal erupts from that office, it rocks one of the main pillars of our great democratic institution, Canada's Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483031">I already knew that the government does not have a great deal of respect for the legal system, judges, courts and, now, even for the Supreme Court of Canada. Still, it is incredible that the Prime Minister of Canada's office is so deeply involved in such a situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483032">Make no mistake. The holier than thou Conservatives can feign indignation as much as they want and swear, with their hands on their hearts, that they wanted Canadian taxpayers to be reimbursed, but the information obtained proves the contrary. Perhaps that is where their problem lies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483033">They now have no credibility because their versions of the story, from the first day to yesterday, and perhaps even up to today, are diametrically opposed, different and conflicting. People are hungrily following this story because it reads like a thrilling political suspense novel.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3483034">People are wondering what went on. Everyone has an idea in their mind, but if you do not, I will help you out. Everyone remembers the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s absolutely extraordinary meetings with Mike Duffy. He was the star they brought in to make the Prime Minister look good on so many occasions that it is almost laughable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483035">Now they are distancing themselves from Mike Duffy, even though he used to play an extremely important role for the Conservative Party and the government. The Conservatives could meet people all over Canada and Mike Duffy would help make the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> seem a little more human. No one has a hard time believing what is in the sworn statement from the RCMP, in which it appears that they wanted to protect someone who was very important to the party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483036">However, when you make up a story and try to manipulate the truth and rationalize, you eventually reach a point where you have problems knowing what is right and true. At some point, your story stops making sense, so you are forced to do a complete 180 and distance yourself as much as possible from the situation. That is what we are seeing here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483037">I once asked the parliamentary secretary a question and told him that it would be much easier to apply the saying, “a fault confessed is half redressed”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483038">The Conservatives could have said that there was a misunderstanding about the expenses but that they were going to take care of it, instead of inventing this absolutely nightmarish scheme in which they are trying to defend the indefensible and change things by the back door. Then, they rise and try to suggest that they did this for Canadians, to ensure that they were not out that $90,000 we keep hearing about. Someone repaid the money, and it was not just anyone. It was the person closest to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483039">In view of the notes that the government blithely hands out to everyone, I think that it—and the PMO in fact—are confusing the concept of responsibility with the concept of finding a scapegoat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483040">I think that the Conservatives truly believe that standing up and saying that Nigel Wright accepts responsibility should be good enough for the rest of us. We should just accept that and say, okay, we have the person responsible. It does not work like that. We are talking about the PMO in the same way we talk about a department being the responsibility of the minister. This Canadian democracy and its democratic pillars have to mean something. We have a system of ministerial responsibilities that does not seem to mean much of anything any more, when the government can hide behind the Nigel Wrights of this world to justify not taking responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483041">Whether things happen with the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s knowledge or not, whether he is aware or not, the fact remains that when something happens on his watch, it is his responsibility. It is up to him to stand before Canadians and apologize and tell them that something inappropriate happened and that he is going to get to the bottom of things and find the truth. He should not say this, learn that, change his story, take three steps back, move ahead two steps, step to the side and let his parliamentary secretary answer for him and so on and so forth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483042">In closing, the unfortunate thing about all of this is that, once again, after the sponsorship scandal and the Gomery commission, after being promised the moon and the stars by this Conservative government, which was supposed to be squeaky clean, all we have seen is one scandal after another. This is having an impact on all of us, on all members from all parties. It will not be easy to regain the trust of Canadians. Right now every Canadian thinks that we must get to the bottom of this and ensure that the truth comes out about the Senate.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3483061">Mr. Speaker, the Liberal motion moved by my hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170282" Type="2">Beauséjour</Affiliation> calls on the House to do three things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483062">First of all, it invites us to condemn the unacceptable and irresponsible actions of certain members of the Prime Minister's Office. Second, it reminds the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> that, according to his own guide entitled “Accountable Government: A Guide for Ministers and Ministers of State”, he is personally responsible for the actions of his office. Third, it calls on the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to testify under oath in a context in which he must stop avoiding the questions, as he always does in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483063">The rationale for the Liberal motion currently before the House is RCMP Corporal Greg Horton's sworn affidavit, which indicates that fraud has been committed by the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s former chief of staff, Nigel Wright, and Senator Mike Duffy. It states, “[They] have committed...frauds”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483064">The first perpetrator, Mr. Wright, secretly gave a $90,000 cheque to the second perpetrator, Mr. Duffy, to pay back his ineligible expense claims. The second perpetrator, Mr. Duffy, accepted the cheque on the condition that he state publicly that he was paying the money back himself. According to the RCMP, they committed fraud. The RCMP seems to be accusing them not only of fraud, but also corruption and breach of trust. This is very serious.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483065">Who else knew about this fraud, besides Mr. Wright and Mr. Duffy? Who was involved? Who closed their eyes? Are the accomplices still members of this government? Do they still work for this government? If so, why?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483066">The government refuses to answer these questions. It keeps repeating that only Mr. Wright and Mr. Duffy are under investigation and are entirely responsible for this matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483067">The government's refusal to answer this simple question—Who knew what?—is very disconcerting. This evasiveness comes from the top, from the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself, and makes us fear the worst.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483068">Some are concerned that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself was involved and that he did know about it. He is behaving as though he has something to hide and not like someone with a clear conscience. He avoids questions, repeats the same stock phrases and is not being forthright.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483069">At this point in this lurid business, there are only two possible scenarios. In the first, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> knows the truth, but is hiding it from Canadians. In the second, the Prime Minister did not know, and members of his staff kept him in the dark. It is either one or the other. Either he knew, and lied, or he did not know and they lied to him. “They” refers to people other than Mr. Wright, if we are to believe Corporal Horton's affidavit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483070">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> claims otherwise: Nigel Wright was the only staff member who hid the truth from him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483071">On Friday, November 22, when the Prime Minister was in Manitoba, a CBC journalist asked him the following question: “Do you believe that others, besides Mike Duffy and Nigel Wright, kept you in the dark? That was the question. The Prime Minister answered no. That is impossible. The Prime Minister's answer cannot be true. He misled Canadians with that answer. That answer cannot be true because we know that other members of the Prime Minister's office were aware of efforts made so Mike Duffy would not have to pay back what he owed. Some knew that Nigel Wright had written him a $90,000 cheque. If the Prime Minister did not know, a number of his staff members kept him in the dark, not just Nigel Wright.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483072">Let us follow the sequence of events as outlined in the statement given under oath by Corporal Horton, starting with what happened in February 2013.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="45">(1145)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3483073">In an interview with police, Nigel Wright confirmed that he asked the Conservative Fund of Canada chairman, Conservative senator and bagman Irving Gerstein, to repay Senator Duffy's bogus expenses of $32,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483074">On February 21 Benjamin Perrin, the Prime Minister's personal lawyer in the PMO, and Senator Duffy's lawyer exchange emails detailing the plan to have the Conservative Party pay Duffy's $32,000 in bogus housing claims as well as his legal fees. The agreement describes this as keeping Duffy “whole on the repayment”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483075">On February 22 Wright confirms with Gerstein that the party will pay the expenses and the legal fees. Later on February 22, Wright emails Perrin and states, “I do want to speak to the Prime Minister before everything is considered final”. Less than an hour later, Wright sends a follow-up email to Perrin that says, “We are good to go from the PM once Ben has his confirmation from Payne”, Ben being Mr. Perrin, the PMO lawyer, and Madam Payne being Mr. Duffy's lawyer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483076">The PM's chief of staff and personal lawyer are specifically discussing a plan that is contained in an email from Duffy's lawyer that includes covering Duffy's bogus expenses and legal fees. When Wright says that he has to check with the Prime Minister before everything is final, he can only be talking about the deal that they have negotiated with Duffy's lawyer. When Wright says that the Prime Minister is “good to go once Ben has his confirmation from Payne”, the only thing they had discussed with Payne was the plan to have the Conservative Party repay Duffy's expenses and legal fees. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483077">The email evidence and chronology presented by the RCMP are clear. Nigel Wright sought the approval of the Prime Minister for something. At the exact same time as this approval was sought and received, the PMO was negotiating a deal with Duffy's lawyer to have the Conservative Party repay Duffy's bogus expenses. Given that the emails show that finalizing the points of the deal with Duffy's lawyer was what Wright and Perrin were focused on at the time, what else could they have been seeking approval for from the Prime Minister? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483078">The evidence is so strong that it is simply not believable for the Prime Minister to claim that he was authorizing Duffy to repay his own expenses. Not only is that patently absurd and unbelievable statement, the emails tell a very different story.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>

              <ParaText id="3483079">For the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s version to be credible, Nigel Wright would have had to lie to the Prime Minister and make him believe that Mike Duffy was going to pay back the money himself, and he would have had to lie to all of his accomplices and make them believe that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> approved the Conservative Party making the payment. That is rather unbelievable, is it not?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483080">However, even if we accept this version that Nigel Wright is a double liar, we would then have to conclude that the other parties to the scheme also hid the truth from the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. They knew that Mike Duffy would not make the payment. They apparently never told the Prime Minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483081">If that is the case, why are some of them still working for the government? Why, for example, is Senator Gerstein, who allegedly hid the truth from the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, still a member of the Conservative caucus? Why is it impossible to get an answer to this question from the Prime Minister or any member of his caucus? Do our Conservative colleagues have no desire to help Canadians get the truth?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483082">Let us see how this unfolded.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3483083">On February 27, Duffy's lawyer emails Perrin and informs him that the amount Duffy owes in bogus expense claims has now risen to $90,000. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483084">Wright also told police that, in addition to Perrin, he informed the following people that he would personally provide Duffy with the $90,000 to repay his bogus expenses: Conservative Senator Irving Gerstein, Chair of the Conservative Fund Canada; Benjamin Perrin, as I said, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s personal lawyer in the PMO; David van Hemmen, formerly Nigel Wright's assistant and now policy adviser to the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>; Patrick Rogers, then legislative assistant to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and now director of policy for the <Affiliation DbId="194612" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Heritage</Affiliation>; and Chris Woodcock, then director of issues management and now chief of staff for the <Affiliation DbId="170686" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483085">For example, on March 8 Nigel Wright advised Chris Woodcock by email that he was personally covering Duffy's $90,000. On March 23 Nigel Wright sent an email to David van Hemmen that said “My cheque is in the correspondence folder”. The same day, Wright wrote an email to Benjamin Perrin that said “I will send my cheque on Monday”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483086">It is true that there is no proof that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was aware of the cheque, but according to Wright, he was aware of something. He wrote in an email, “The PM knows, in broad terms only, that I personally assisted Duffy”. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was aware of that.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3483087">Even if we accept the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s story that he knew nothing about the financial aid to Mike Duffy, why is he keeping in his government individuals who hid the truth and the fraudulent activities from him? Why is David van Hemmen still a policy advisor to the Minister of State for Finance? Did he not hide the truth from the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483088">Why is Patrick Rogers still the director of policy for the <Affiliation DbId="194612" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Heritage</Affiliation>? Did he not hide the truth from the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>? Why is Chris Woodcock still the chief of staff for the <Affiliation DbId="170686" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation>? Did he not hide the truth from the Prime Minister? Why is Senator Gerstein still a member of the Conservative caucus and the Conservative Party's bagman? Did he not hide the truth from the Prime Minister? Unless these people did not hide anything at all from the Prime Minister. That would then mean that the Prime Minister was aware of the fraud and is trying to hide that from Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483089">The Conservatives have to choose between the only two possible scenarios. Either the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was aware of the fraud and is trying to hide that from Canadians, or the Prime Minister did not know anything about the fraud and key people around him hid the truth from him. If so, why is he keeping them on staff?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483090">In fact, the Conservatives can do better than choose between these two scenarios. They should tell us which one is the truth. Canadians have a right to the truth. They have the right to know whether their <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is an honest and straightforward man or a secretive manipulator who thinks that hiding the truth is acceptable conduct in Canadian politics.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3483139">I would like to, at this point, start my speech by talking about the narrative that is talked about not only here but when it comes to public discourse, public discussions. I speak of politics, of course, but I speak about politics in the general sense of what we do here, which is to enable the discussion to be centred right here, at this focal point, because this is what Canadians are talking about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483140">A lot of people would say the issue we are debating today is not germane to everyday goings-on, the machinations of how we live and how we operate as a society. The economy, yes, jobs, yes, as we have talked about, and crime are all important products of this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483141">However, I will say this. We also compel our politicians to strive to be the utmost in ethical behaviour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483142">We have heard it. Many people in this House have either been accused or have been brought to a court and found guilty over the years. Many have admitted their guilt. Many of them have been found guilty. Some of them have been found innocent of all accusations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483143">However, this is the type of discourse we have here. This is the type of conversation we need to have to get to the bottom of the matter as to what behaviour took place in the office, funded by taxpayers, the office we put trust in every four years, via a ballot box, being the democracy that we are—the greatest democracy, I might add, in the whole world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483144">Let me go back to the narrative. The narrative of the story is that we expect public officials to strive to be the most ethical individuals and, also, to be the caretakers of our finances, of our taxes, to exercise authority in this office to ensure they are doing it at the utmost level of the ethical standards and, of course, to do it as any reasonable person in this country would expect them to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483145">Let me go back. Let me flash back for a just moment to when I first arrived here in the House of Commons. It was 2004 when I arrived here in the fall, for the first time. I sat on the other side of the House, in the Liberal Party, which was government at the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483146">What I faced was an absolute barrage of angst, hatred and accusations, some true, some not, but the hatred and the vitriol that was in this House was palpable and was incredibly thick.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483147">Flash forward a few years and we found ourselves overturned in an election. We then, at that time, sat in the opposition. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483148">I heard it on the doorstep during that 2004 period, but a lot of this vitriol and a lot of this hatred was put forward by the opposition parties of the day, including, I might add, the current government. Many of those people are in this House today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483149">However, a lot of the people who are in this House today, I would even say the majority of the people in the government in this House today, were not here at that time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483150"> I hear the argument, every time we lay out what has happened and we say to Canadians and we say in this House, in public discourse, “Look. Here is the situation that happened within the Prime Minister's Office. It is something that is substandard. It is something that does not measure up to the ethical expectations of this country”, and we get back, “Well, the Liberals did this back then” and “But back then, you did this”, without answering the question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483151">My response to this is always that if the government can only say to us what was done in the past, as opposed to what we are dealing with in the present, then it proves that the government has become everything it said it would not be. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483152">There we have it, the narrative that goes from then to now.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="10">(1210)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3483153">The problem with many politicians today, sometimes me included, is that we need to own up to what was done wrong. We need to tell ourselves that there has to be a time when we reflect upon what we say, what we do and the actions we take, and ask if they are up to the standard of what a reasonable taxpayer and citizen of this country would expect. I would say that in many cases we do not and turn a blind eye. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483154">What bothers me the most is that when we turn the blind eye by avoiding the topic and talking about something else, we have to make one base assumption, which is that the citizens watching this today did not notice or that the citizens watching today do not care enough to listen to the specific questions. What a sad mistake that is when we campaign, do television commercials, tweet the nasty stuff and simply say, “If you think what we did is bad, look at what you did”, and the argument goes back and forth—to use the vernacular, “I know you are, but what am I”, as said by many four and five year olds. We pretend Canadians do not even notice, but they do. We do not give the average citizen in this country enough credit for being intelligent enough to read between the lines. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483155">Yes, by the way, before the question comes, I will follow my own advice and try to measure up to a standard that was given to us to be sitting here in the House of Commons. Can anyone imagine how many citizens in this country would dream some day of standing or sitting in this place where we are today, my friends? Let us make this debate about an ethical standard that we feel is not up to par. Let us make this debate about an ethical standard that we strive to be. However, in doing that, we have to point out that there are people among us—and I am including all parties—who do not measure up to this, given the trust of the public. There are people who are given the trust of the public who need to be looked at. We need to shine a spotlight on their actions and come up with answers. We talk about judicial inquiries. They are expensive and they take time. Sometimes they are necessary. The problem is that many times we have to realize that this is a forum that taxpayers pay for and their voices need to be heard.</ParaText>

We talk about the recent sworn statements by the RCMP, Corporal Greg Horton. They reveal that in many cases the ethical standard was not reached, which is putting it mildly, and some cases that ethical standard appears to have been subverted. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483157">On February 21, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office had agreed, with regard to Mike Duffy's controversial expenses, that the Conservative Party of Canada would keep him whole on the repayment. This is the type of conversation that took place. What exactly does that mean? We try to pontificate as to what exactly that means, and I am sure the average Canadian does. In other words, how do we protect an individual who has—pardon the vernacular again—fallen off the rails when it comes to ethical standards?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483158">On February 22, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s chief of staff wanted “to speak to the PM before everything is considered final”. Later the same day, February 22, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s chief of staff confirmed, “We are good to go from the PM once Ben has his confirmation from Payne”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483159">My hon. colleagues have already discussed the details, names and faces, colleagues like the member for <Affiliation DbId="170086" Type="2">Saint-Laurent—Cartierville</Affiliation>. What I want to focus on again is the narrative, and the narrative is about how these actions do not measure up to the ethical standard, which was not met.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3483160">Agreement was reached between Benjamin Perrin and Janice Payne, counsels for the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and Mike Duffy. The amount to keep Mike Duffy whole was calculated to be higher than first determined, requiring a changed source of funds from Conservative Party funds to Nigel Wright's personal funds, after which the arrangement proceeded and Duffy's expenses were repaid.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483161">Let us go back for a moment. As citizens, we have the right, thank goodness, because we are the best democracy in the world, to not only vote for a particular party, its beliefs, ideals, ideology, but we also have the right to donate money to help them communicate that message to the masses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483162">As a Conservative Party fundraiser, certainly as a donor, if I were, imagine my dismay and shock to realize that my money went to Mike Duffy to say this is something for him to walk out and look good while doing it. It is particularly galling, to say the least. It got to a certain level where even Senator Gerstein could not handle it anymore. That threshold was gone. He had a certain threshold and a certain amount of money, but he just could not go any further. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483163">Certainly when it climbed close to $100,000 and the personal cheque was written, I ask the people watching this at home or in the gallery to imagine that someone we barely know has done something wrong so we are going to reimburse them with a cheque close to $100,000 and by the way, that is from our account. Imagine that. We might do it for our children, but certainly not for someone we barely know. The narrative goes to the fact that there is not just one person in on this. There is a network of people involved in keeping this from the spotlight. That is the narrative that fails Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483164">I know the Conservatives are going to talk about the past and about certain things that happened in my party in the past, but the point is that we go through the process of getting to the answers, which is what in 2004 we did to find the answers to make sure it did not happen again.</ParaText>

We talked about the example of online services that need to be centralized and more accessible to people of all walks of life from everywhere in the country, whether it is urban, rural, east, west or north. However, these are inefficiencies in the system that start out with the best of intentions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483166"> We want to engage citizens across this country by using online resources. Yes, it saves money and allows people to do it any time of the day. We know people are busy travelling back and forth to work, not just from a small geographical area, but many people in my riding travel from Newfoundland and Labrador to Alberta on a bi-weekly basis, or around the world to Russia, to Africa. They want their services to be online.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483167"> I bring this up by way of example because the inefficiencies that we have right now started out with the best of intentions. Is that germane to this debate? Yes, it is because this situation we are dealing with today did not start with the best of intentions and it got worse and worse. It pulled more and more people in. It became a situation of not just inefficiencies but of some substandard ethical actions taking place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483168">I certainly believe that the motion today not only highlights that, but also looks at ways that we can fix it. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3483169">Let us have a look at some of the other details in this. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has given contradictory responses to the House of Commons, that we know. To the people out there watching today, we know exactly what it is we are talking about. Did he quit? Was he fired? Originally he quit. He is a nice guy, a good guy, means well. A few months later it was, he was fired.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483170"> There is a word we use in Newfoundland, called “sleveen”. It is someone of sub-ethical standards, and I am being kind. They are usually described in a much harsher way. They basically sleeveened the guy. If nothing, I hope we have learned a new word today from the Newfoundland dictionary: sleveen, someone of substandard ethical values.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483171">Basically they have pointed out that this man is the sleveen of the most sleveen nature. I do not even know if that makes sense. I am trying to illustrate the point by saying that everybody in this country is talking about it. Everybody wants to know what is happened here, because they do not want to see it happen again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483172">The RCMP court filing also paints a disturbing picture of the entire PMO senior staff. The “fraud squad” engaged in the whitewash of a Senate report. Now we are going back to the other side with the whitewashing of a report that looks at this and says that there are people involved here, calls made from people on the board of the internal economy to the senator involved in the actions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483173">The conversation went like this, and this is why everybody is talking about it, because everybody understands this part. I am not a lawyer and when we look at some of this stuff, the vernacular of what is written down in legalize, sometimes it is hard to understand. Here is what is easy to understand. They wanted to get rid of the part or fix the part that shows that Senator Mike Duffy claimed per diems, claiming money because he was working in Ottawa on the very same day he was in Florida.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483174">Now that I get, any Canadian can get that, anybody watching today can get that. Someone claimed money for doing their job in Canada while finding themselves in Florida. I doubt if anyone would even consider Florida the 11th province.</ParaText>

                <B>Mr. Scott Simms:</B> Sure, let us use Mexico. It is the same sort of difference; the person dealt with is gone. That is how malfeasance works, but that is admitted to.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3483178"> However, that was the case. The light was shone on that and actions were taken. For this one, where is the spotlight?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483179">Here we have a situation where it is not just one person anymore, it is several. The story unravels, the details come out and the documents come out. Let us just have a look at it for what it is. It is people behaving badly. People not behaving in the way in which Canadians expect them to behave.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483180">I would leave with this thought. In 2006 I was in government. The Conservative candidate at the time put a flyer in the mail to every person in my riding. They said the worst thing one can do is not keep promises. Well, that is a good point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483181">However, here is a worse one. Since then we have seen this many times by the government. Not only did the Conservatives break the promise they made, but they continue to try to convince Canadians that they kept it when they know that they did not. When will the Conservatives practice what they used to preach?</ParaText>

He started off talking about how upset he was, how when he was in government he did not like the course of debate, and he thought we could elevate the debate. Then he goes on in his speech. He talked about four individuals and coins them, in his attempt to elevate the debate, the “fraud squad”. These are people, of course, who have not been accused of anything and who are not the subject of any investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483183">He talked earlier on in his speech about how we should be more respectful of each other. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has said that he did not know. The RCMP documents on page 72 outlined that the RCMP do not have any evidence that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> knew anything about this. The member does not accept this at face value. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said he expected more from his staff. The Liberals do not accept that at face value. Nigel Wright has said that he did not bring the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> into his confidence on this. They do not accept that at face value.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483184">As we go on and on in the report, every time there is something that shows that this <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> worked with, co-operated with and assisted the RCMP, the Liberals never accept it at face value.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3483189">I will say this. At the beginning, the member said “elevate the debate” and I used a term with the word “fraud” in it. My apologies. He is absolutely right. Sometimes what can happen in the course of debate is that we get carried away. However, we have to be a measure above what people expect so that we can say that it is probably not the right terminology to use. If the member was offended, I apologize.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483190">What he did talk about was the lone person involved in that situation, in that office.

It is to the extent now where I am flabbergasted to think that somebody was the lone individual in all of this, the fall guy. Nigel Wright started out as the saviour of the Conservative Party.

              <ParaText id="3483192">Mr. Speaker, I listened with some interest to the comments by the member for <Affiliation DbId="170738" Type="2">Bonavista—Gander—Grand Falls—Windsor</Affiliation>. As one might expect, I was a bit surprised and interested in his comments about the Newfoundland dictionary. I want to ask him about that dictionary because there are some words that have been used in the House where the meaning is not entirely clear to me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483193">On this side of the House, we have been asking the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> about the investigation into the Prime Minister's Office around the Wright-Duffy scandal. Clearly, we know that the RCMP is involved. We know that questions are being asked of a number of staff members in the Prime Minister's Office. We do not know who else is being questioned by the RCMP but we do know that the PMO is involved. However, when we rise in the House to ask the Prime Minister a question about the investigation to get some clarity so that the Canadian public can understand what the breadth and scope of this investigation is, which I would argue every Canadian is entitled to as we are talking about the money of Canadian taxpayers being at stake here, he responds by saying that there is no investigation. Therefore, people are being questioned, the RCMP is doing the questioning, but apparently there is no investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483194">I wonder whether the member could turn to his Newfoundland dictionary and tell us what the definition of an investigation might be. Perhaps that would help us answer a question that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> refuses to answer.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3483195">Mr. Speaker, I have to rise to that occasion and see how this goes. There is a word in the Newfoundland dictionary called mauzy, M-A-U-Z-Y. It describes a weather phenomenon. I used to be a TV weatherman so I kind of know what I am talking about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483196">Anyway, mauzy usually occurs in the morning. It is like a thick grey fog with a bit of rain in the air so it is very obscured and very hard to see. Visibility is reduced dramatically. What I am getting at is that within the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office it is very mauzy. The visibility has been reduced dramatically. We cannot see a hand in front of our eyes. That is the word mauzy. It is a bit rainy and a bit wet. It is very uncomfortable in the PMO. Therefore, to say that the greyness that surrounds the PMO is mauzy is an understatement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483197">I enjoy what the member said. I also appreciate the fact that there are so many contradictions involved here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483198">Let us take a look at Mr. Hamilton, another lawyer. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">PM</Affiliation> has defended the actions of his party and its lawyer. If he has no problem with what Hamilton has done, he should have no problem testifying before a court where real answers can be given rather than 15-second talking points. That is pretty mauzy as well, if we think about it. There is a greyness around that area. There are so many lawyers involved here who are doing what are considered substandard ethical things, one gets a little awry upstairs. We start to understand exactly what is going on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483199">There is the mauzy that takes place within the PMO. I want to thank my colleague for bringing that up. Any more words? I am kind of running out of a dictionary.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3483201">Members have probably noticed, I know I have, but I would ask my colleague whether he has noticed the complete absence of participation in this debate by the governing party.

They are in the House and they should be answering on their own behalf.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3483203">There is another word for “mauzy” and it is called “obfuscation”. Obfuscation is exactly what is going on here by the non-participation in this debate.</ParaText>

The parliamentary secretary has certainly done that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483207">However, I would like to hear from others as to punching holes into every argument that is out there to get through this obfuscation that my hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170547" Type="2">Guelph</Affiliation> talks about.

              <ParaText id="3483215">Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his introduction of a very useful term, “mauzy” in his speech. He sells himself short as a former weatherman. I have heard weathermen apologize for their weather forecast, saying “Well, I was wrong yesterday, the weather actually wasn't the way I said it was going to be”. That is something I wish the government would do. It could simply say that this was the mistake it made, these are all the facts, this is the truth, it made a mistake and it would take the punishment and move on. If the government had done that early on, it would have contained the effects of the scandal in the Prime Minister's Office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483216">This scandal has consumed a lot of time and resources in Ottawa. The government claims it wants to work on the economy, but the necessity of having clean government, of ferreting out all the misdeeds of the Conservatives in the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s circle, has consumed a lot of time. We have to consume a lot of resources to do the proper investigation, and it is unfortunate that we have had to take this time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483217">My constituency work and my work on the Liberal Party team as a critic for science and technology, post-secondary education and economic development has meant that I cannot be consumed by all the details of the scandal in the Prime Minister's Office. That is probably true for most Canadians. They have their daily lives, family members to take care of, jobs to go to and communities to be part of. They do not have time to immerse themselves in all the details. I am in the same boat. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483218">I hear all these names and it is very hard to keep track of many of them in the Prime Minister's Office, in the leadership of the Conservatives in the Senate and in the Conservative Party. It seems like all the Prime Minister's men and women have been involved in this cover-up. My question for the Prime Minister would be this. If he is really running the country, or managing the country's economy for Canadians, as the Conservatives would like to claim, how could he be so cut off from his own people and do a good job as Prime Minister? It does not seem reasonable to me that this could be true. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483219">My guess is that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> must have known because so many people in his inner circle in his office were involved in the cover-up. Cover-up was a word recently used by a spokesperson for the Prime Minister's Office. That is not consistent with a well-functioning team that is responsible for managing the entire country and the economy for Canadians. Either the Prime Minister was involved or he was not managing the country's economy just hoping natural resources prices would stay high.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483220">A lot of Conservative members of Parliament are aware of the facts put forward by the RCMP. They understand how damning the evidence is. They do not want to stand and defend the Prime Minister or try to explain what went on, or to try to put in their own words what they think really happened. From what I understand, there may not be any Conservative MPs standing today to make a speech or to ask questions. So far it has only been the parliamentary secretary who has been up to speak and we know that in question period, it is only the parliamentary secretary who has stood to answer questions when the Prime Minister has not answered them. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3483222">It is clear that Conservative MPs, having looked at the evidence that the RCMP investigators have brought forth and thought about it by themselves, know it would be very damaging to their prospects in the 2015 election if they were to stand and try to defend the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. They can see, from the election results yesterday, that Canadians are very upset by the behaviour and the poor ethical standards of the Prime Minister's Office. They are voting with their feet, by not getting up, and we can see it will be pretty clear</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483223">I need to also comment about some of the things I have heard in the debate today. I had not prepared to talk about this, but I have been hearing the remarks from some of the members in this chamber. It seems to me that, for example, the parliamentary secretary has been trying to say, incorrectly I would add, that the leader of the Liberal Party has not been asking questions about the scandal in the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office. In fact, that is untrue and I stood earlier during this debate to read out a whole list of questions the leader of the Liberal Party had asked in the last few days. Whenever the leader of the Liberal Party is here, he always gets up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483224"> I know the Liberal Party only has 34 seats right now, although 36 seats in a few days, and so we get a limited number of questions in question period. Out of the first 17 questions in question period, this smaller Liberal caucus only gets 3, so I know it is hard for the leader of the Liberal Party to get up and ask a lot of questions, but every time he is here he asks questions. He gets to ask the three questions and he does ask them to keep the government to account. I read out a number of them just a short while ago. Therefore, the parliamentary secretary is making up some things that are totally untrue because there is nothing left to resort to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483225">The Conservatives will not answer the questions that have been posed to them in question period and during today's debate, so all they can do is resort to personal attacks on the Liberal leader, especially since the by-election results yesterday. All they can do is resort to talking about unproven accusations from the past.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483226">What we should be doing today, and as is the intent of the motion today, is to talk about the cover-up, the fact that it does not make sense that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was simply asked if it were okay for Mike Duffy to pay back the expense claims he owed. This is something that, from what I have heard in question period, the Prime Minister would have expected from any member of his caucus. Therefore, why would the Prime Minister ever need to approve something as simple as that? The implication is clear in the RCMP document, and we have heard it in debate and in question period in this chamber, that the Prime Minister was asked something more substantial. We do not know what it was, but it does not make sense that the Prime Minister was simply asked to approve the fact that Senator Duffy should repay the expense claims to which he was not entitled.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483227">For somebody who shares, along with the rest of Canadians, a general sense of what the problem is, but not all of the details, and we hear a lot of conflicting statements that change from week to week and month to month from the members of the Conservative Party, we need to clear the air. We need to cut through the mauzy, as my colleague from Newfoundland and Labrador said. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3483228">We need to clarify what the story is. That is why it is important for the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his inner circle, who have been involved in this cover-up, according to the RCMP, to testify under oath to say, “This is our statement. This is what we say happened”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483229">I think it will be clear, if that happens, that there have been serious ethical breaches in the Prime Minister's Office. It will be clear that the members of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s staff who, it is clear from the RCMP's statements, have been involved in this cover-up, who are going to be charged under certain sections of the Criminal Code, and who are still working for the government, should not be working for the government. It will be clear that if the Prime Minister wants to uphold the standards he claims to uphold, these members of the Prime Minister's Office should not be working for the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483230">For these reasons, it is very important for us to support this motion and to ask the members of the Conservative government who have been involved in this scandal in the Prime Minister's Office to testify under oath, state very clearly what they believe happened, and clear the air and put some sunlight through the mauzy for the people of Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3483234">Let me talk about some of the other points that have been brought up in debate today. The parliamentary secretary talked about income trusts. This is an old accusation that has not been proven. The member for <Affiliation DbId="170090" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation> said that very clearly. He was here when those accusations were first made, and they were just accusations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483235">Members make accusations every day in the House. I wish that when Conservative members answered questions in question period, they would just answer the questions instead of going back years and years to talk about other accusations. This is an example of how members of the government try to deflect questions by bringing up old accusations. This is not a good way of conducting the business of the House. It is not what voters want.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483236">When I walk the streets of Kingston and the Islands, it is not uncommon for people to walk up to me and make some comment about question period. They say that it must be frustrating, because we never get any answers to questions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483237">The topic of today's debate is a very serious one. It is about whether we can trust our head of government, and for that reason, it is very important that when the Conservatives are answering questions, they answer them. They should grab the bull by the horns, acknowledge the questions, and give their best answers. They should not deflect the questions by talking about old accusations or about old stories about one's family or about the pizza delivery man. We have heard these things in the House, and this is not what we are supposed to be doing here. This is not how we are supposed to be serving the people of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483238">It is hard for me to go back to my riding of Kingston and the Islands and tell people that this is what happens and that is why it is called question period. We need to get voluntary compliance from members of Parliament on the government side. This place has a purpose, which is to serve the Canadian people. Questions are asked for a purpose, which is to keep the government to account. This used to be done in the chamber many years ago. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483239">We have to call into question why the government wants to be the government and why it should be the government. Right now, the government has a majority, so we cannot win a vote of non-confidence, but if we had a secret ballot among all members of Parliament as to whether they all have confidence in the government, I wonder if that motion would pass, particularly if the backbench members of the Conservative caucus could vote secretly. I suspect that we might not get all government members supporting the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483240">That is how serious this scandal in the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office is. That is why none of the Conservative members are speaking to this motion. It is because it is toxic. They know that there have been ethical breaches in the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office, and they know that this is very serious. They know from yesterday's by-election results that Canadian voters take this very seriously. They want to get re-elected in 2015, but it is not going to happen with the leadership of the Conservative Party, which is unwilling to admit and fix the mistakes that were made. That is what we have to be talking about today. </ParaText>

It was an enormously enriching experience for me to sit down and talk at length with someone from Alberta and to be able to ask a lot of questions and talk in a very frank and open manner, which is sometimes hard to do when two politicians are speaking, or when a politician is speaking with anybody.</ParaText>

That is why in question period members are quite often flipping through cards and reading the cards with their heads down while answering questions. It is to make sure they do not accidentally say something wrong. There are a lot of members on the Conservative side who think for themselves and who could speak if they were free to speak, or if they were courageous enough to speak or able to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483260">Let me address the second question. In any large organization, the manager cannot manage every single thing that every one of his or her employees does. Nevertheless, the manager is responsible for the actions and consequences of what his or her direct reports do. The way that a manager has to deal with this is to set the culture of an organization. Really the only way someone can direct a large group of people to act in a certain way and to uphold certain standards is to establish a culture, because that is what is possible in management. </ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483279">That is the context of the motion. That is the important part of the motion. What the opposition motion really does, I believe, is give the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> an opportunity to clear the record, if he has nothing to hide. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483280">Comments expressed by his parliamentary secretary, however, lead me to believe that the government will continue the cover-up. It is interesting, as my colleague previously said, that in this debate, the only person who is allowed to speak on the government side is the parliamentary secretary himself. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483281">There are a lot of good people on the backbench of the Conservative Party. There are. I have to ask them if they are under orders not to speak. Do they not care about the scandal in the Prime Minister's Office, this group that came to Ottawa on accountability and transparency? Are they fearful of standing in this place and asking the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> a question? In the Conservative government, have accountability and transparency just gone out the window in what is now clearly not just a cover-up in the Prime Minister's Office, but a cover-up by the whole Conservative Party of Canada and its entire backbench? They are all party to this cover-up in trying to protect the Prime Minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483282">It must be difficult for backbench MPs who came to this place on a law and order, tough-on-crime agenda to swallow themselves whole. It really must be difficult. I sympathize with them that they came on here on a law and order agenda and now they are swallowing themselves whole. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483283">Yes, there are laws, and they need to be abided by, but not by those in the Prime Minister's Office, that is for sure. Being tough on crime clearly only applies to others and not themselves when it comes to this particular government under the current Prime Minister's leadership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483284">If it is a youth from a broken family or a mentally ill person who has got in trouble and broken the law, everything we have seen in the Conservative government is punishment, punishment, punishment, and the harsher the better. The idea is to throw them in jail, practically, and throw away the key. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483285">However, when it comes to government folks, some of their own, it is an entirely different story. In this case, looking at this issue in its simplest terms, it is bribery, fostered by the highest office in this land, the Prime Minister's Office, and that is okay. It is okay to the backbenchers over there. Influencing the buying privileges of senators and sanitizing a Senate report are okay. That bribery is not a crime to Conservative backbenchers, and they do not seem to want any answers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483286">Let us recall again what I said a moment ago about the Federal Accountability Act. The Conservative government may have had great intentions and it may have passed the Accountability Act, but it sure does not follow it. As far as transparency goes, every Canadian knows, except seemingly those on the backbench over here, that this is the most secretive government in Canadian history. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3483287">There are lots of areas where laws do not seem to matter to the Conservative Party. We have the in-and-out scandal, the robocalls, the Duffy-PMO scandal, and the list goes on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483288">I want to recall the words of this Conservative <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to a former prime minister and ask members in the governing party if these words apply to this Prime Minister . He said that if the Prime Minister knew about the scam, it was unconscionable, and if he did not, it was incompetence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483289">Does that statement not apply to this <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>? That statement certainly does.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483290">Let us imagine this: his chief of staff knew, but the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> did not. About a dozen people, his closest advisers, knew, but the Prime Minister  did not. The head of the Conservative Fund knew, and was willing to pay the bribe as long as it was only $32,000. That is the head of the Conservative Fund, a senator appointed by this Prime Minister. He knew, but the Prime Minister did not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483291">An audit of Duffy was sanitized at the request of close advisers to the PMO, a circle of them, and with the full co-operation of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s leader in the Senate; a second senator, his former communications director; and a third loyal senator. This neat little trifecta of three closest loyal senators knew about the changing of evidence, fostered by a buyout, a bribe in the Senate, but the Prime Minister   did not know.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483292">Does that not really stretch reality? I certainly think so. Do Conservative members expect us to believe that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> did not know? That is incredible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483293">Let me come back and re-quote that statement. It was that if the Prime Minister knew about the scam, it was unconscionable, and if he did not, it was incompetence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483294">I ask members on the government side, those who are sitting there with their lips zipped, which is it? It has to be one or the other.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483295">Let us go back to the real reason the Senate scandal has landed on the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s desk. The Prime Minister  made the appointment in the first place, in violation of the residency requirements. Why did he do that? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483296">When we think about it, we realize why. Many in the country, many of the legal and constitutional experts, believe what the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> did in the appointment of Wallin and Duffy was a violation of the Constitution. I certainly believe it was.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483297">Senator Duffy is supposed to be my senator. He lives in my riding. However, he certainly does not represent Prince Edward Island; he represents the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s voice in coming back to Prince Edward Island to tell them what they should do. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483298">I have not heard Senator Duffy speak out on EI. I have not seen him in the coffee shops, talking to the people affected by employment insurance. He is a messenger for the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in Prince Edward Island. That is not the way it is supposed to be, which is the other way around.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483299">On this issue, as on other issues, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> clearly just did not care. He just did not care about violating the Constitution of this country that we in this Parliament are supposed to represent. I can say to all those quiet backbenchers over there who were sent here with an obligation to represent the country that when the Constitution is being violated, they obviously do not care either. They stand and they cheer on the issue as the Prime Minister   defends himself in an unconscionable cover-up.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3483300">What was the real objective of having two high-profile media types appointed to the Senate? A government member can correct me if I am wrong, but I think it was to have those senators, because they were well known in the media, go out and spin the message. Recall, they were the two key fundraisers within the Conservative Party for awhile. I believe they co-chaired the last Conservative convention before the one just about a month ago. I believe that a year or two ago they co-chaired that convention. They were the high and mighty, but now the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is throwing them under the bus to try to cover up his own involvement in terms of the bribery of the Senate and the auditing of a report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483301">I vividly remember watching the program, and I can recall Senator Duffy sitting on his little stool in the media-type atmosphere, interviewing the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, looking him in the eye and asking him tough questions with only invited guests in the audience, all the Conservative lawyers. The whole idea behind the thing was to make it look on TV like this was the Mike Duffy of old asking a Prime Minister tough questions. Really what it was all about was spin, trying to manipulate and manoeuvre Canadians into believing the Prime Minister's message. That is what it was all about. It was spin, and nothing else. That is one of the reasons the Prime Minister appointed Mike Duffy. The Prime Minister  violated the Constitution in terms of the residential requirements to appoint these two media-profile people to go out there and really, in effect, abuse the trust of Canadians by providing spin for the Conservative message and the Conservative song.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483302">When these folks were appointed, can members picture the gaggle of advisers, the hangers-on around the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office as to whom they should appoint and how they should do it? The Prime Minister was probably advised that it could be a violation of the Constitution. However, the Prime Minister probably said not to worry about it, that he did not care about the Constitution and that they needed these people for a purpose, to sell the Conservative message on what the Conservative government was doing, in everything from its cutbacks on services to Canadians to its attack on seasonal workers to whatever we can name, to provide the spin to try to massage the message. Therefore, the Prime Minister went with the appointment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483303">I would even go a little further. Maybe the parliamentary secretary can tell me if this actually happened. He was not parliamentary secretary then, but he might have been in the meeting. Can members imagine that first meeting of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> with Senators Duffy and Wallin? As I said, the parliamentary secretary can tell me if I am right or wrong, but I expect this is what was said: “Pam, Mike, go out there and sell the message. Do the fundraising for the Conservative Party and bill the Senate”. Was that what was said? “Bill the Senate and do it at the taxpayers' expense”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483304">I know Mike Duffy well. I have known him for years. He is a visitor to the province from time to time. He has a fictional residence in Green Gables, so I know him well. He took his orders well. I will not get into the wording of what Senator Duffy said in the Senate on this issue. He thought he had permission to bill the Senate. He maybe never looked at the rules, but I expect he was told by the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to just bill the Senate and everything would be fine. Now we know it was not fine.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3483305"> Really, only the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> can tell us if that is what actually happened to get these senators in this kind of trouble. I would think the Prime Minister  and his minions on the other side would see this as an opportunity. For the Prime Minister , if he has nothing to hide, it is an opportunity to come forward and clear the record. I think that would be a good thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483306">As a member of Parliament from Prince Edward Island, this entire scandal concerning Senator Duffy, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Prime Minister's Office has been one that has had a direct impact on residents in my province. It really bothers me when I read in the press or I see in the nightly news, night after night, Prince Edward Island Senator Mike Duffy, then the scandal, then the expenses and all that kind of stuff. Prince Edward Islanders are so embarrassed. I have had people call me from Vancouver asking what is wrong with Prince Edward Islanders. They did not realize that, from our point of view as Islanders, Mike Duffy is not our senator. He is the Prime Minister 's senator. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483307">It is a real problem. As I said, this is the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s senator, not Prince Edward Island's.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483308">As for the previous owner of that cottage, seeing the cottage on the news nightly with this kind of scandal, for which the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has to accept responsibility, it brought the daughter of the previous owner near to tears in talking to me. She said if her dad saw that cottage held in the light that it was on the nightly news, he would be very saddened. That is as a result of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> appointing a senator who is not actually a resident of Prince Edward Island and then abusing that privilege and that trust.</ParaText>

Those reports were well researched and were good reports. Whereas, with the very nature of this place, we are a little more partisan, so I think we ought to be careful on the Senate issue. </ParaText>

What they were talking about was a payment of $32,000, which was at the time what they thought was owed by Mr. Duffy. It was something the Conservative Party was prepared to pay on his behalf. One hour later, Mr. Wright came back and said, “We are good to go from the PM...”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483337">Now of course they deny it, but it is kind of like the driver of a getaway car going to steal with others from the bank. They go into the bank intending to steal $50,000 and they come out with $100,000. Then the driver of the car says, “I am not guilty; they were only supposed to steal $50,000 not $100,000”. Given that there is not a journalist out there, nor a jurist or anyone who believes the Prime Minister in his explanation, I am wondering if the member for Malpeque could be a little less speculative and tell us whether he thinks it actually does sit right at the feet of the Prime Minister?</ParaText>

The “good to go” really meant it was okay to spend $32,000 out of the Conservative fund, with the approval of the senator in the Senate. However, when they realized that it was more money than that, then it was not okay to go with the $90,000 that Nigel Wright paid privately. Both are the same principle. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3483343">I would like to very briefly address one small point in the motion from the Liberal Party, which is the whole question of requiring the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to speak under oath. I will be supporting this motion, but I want to suggest that this is a bit superfluous. Any MP in the House, including the Prime Minister, must tell the truth. It is a matter of our parliamentary privilege. Every time the Prime Minister stands in the House, he is duty bound to tell the truth. Therefore, he actually already is, in the best sense of the words, under oath every time he is in the House. We need a little more information from the Liberals on exactly what kind of process would perfect what the Prime Minister already has a duty to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483344">I rose in the House on May 21 to ask the very first series of questions on the criminality involved in what we now know to be a criminal scheme. I referenced section 16 of the Parliament of Canada Act and then section 119 of the Criminal Code. This is almost a symbolic point I want to make. The Parliament of Canada Act, subsection 16(1), states:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483345">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">No member of the Senate shall receive or agree to receive any compensation, directly or indirectly, for services rendered or to be rendered to any person, either by the member or another person,</QuotePara>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">(a) in relation to any...controversy, charge, accusation, arrest or other matter before the Senate or the House of Commons or a committee of either House;</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483346">It fits perfectly and actually applies only to the Senate and senators. Interestingly, and this is the symbolic point, any senator guilty of this provision is liable to a fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than $4,000. There is no jail time in this provision, but every person who gives the bribe and is not the senator, according to section 16 of the Parliament of Canada Act, is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year. The symbolic difference between how the Parliament of Canada Act is drafted so that senators can actually be bribed and avoid jail while somebody else involved in the same process goes to jail—an average citizen, for example—is an absolutely symbolic statement of the state of privilege and, indeed, institutional corruption in that body.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483347">Many of us have read in detail the affidavit from RCMP officer Horton, 80-some pages, where he not only mentions section 119 of the Criminal Code and bribery but also mentions breach of public trust in section 122 and fraud on the government in section 121. All three of these provisions seem very clearly to be made out given what we know about the quid pro quo arrangement involving at least Mr. Duffy and Mr. Wright, where Mr. Duffy's side of the deal would be to be silent both in the Senate and in public, and the side of the deal for at least Mr. Wright—and others in the PMO quite likely—was that there would be money paid back to Mr. Duffy so that he would not have to bear the cost of the expenses he owed and also that there would be some kind of rigging of a report coming out of the Senate so it would go easy on Mr. Duffy. That was a key part of the quid pro quo as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483348">What I would like to focus the remainder of my remarks on is the fact that we cannot be blinded by the Wright-Duffy relationship as the direct participatory side, two parties clearly involved. This whole thing is most clearly a scheme. Others are involved. We know of different aspects, thanks to this very historically unusual insight provided by the affidavit from the RCMP. Assistance and participation, other than being the directly involved party, is part of our Criminal Code, and with section 22 of the Criminal Code, frankly, depending on what the evidence reveals, I would suggest that we can start with the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483349">With respect to a person counselling an offence, subsection 22(1) states:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3483351">It does not matter that somebody says “Please go out and do a hit job by kneecapping somebody with a hammer” and the person uses an iron bar instead. It does not matter if the source of illegal funds in a transaction was originally the Conservative Party's funds but turned out to be Mr. Wright's own funds, because either source is equally criminal. If that was to be the case, anybody counselling that initial payment from the Conservative Party fund would be equally guilty if it turned out that another fund was used.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483352">Also, section 21 deals with parties to an offence, that being all criminal offences in the House, including the ones I have already read out on bribery, fraud against the government and breach of public trust. Every one of them has an analogue or accessory life, which is that other people can be involved as aiders or abettors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483353"> As well, section 465 of the Criminal Code speaks to conspiracy wherein a number of people could agree to be part of a scheme. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483354">I would like to suggest that we move on to another character in this quite tawdry and sordid drama, Senator Gerstein. Let us look at the whole idea of aiding what we know to have occurred between Mr. Wright and Mr. Duffy. We know that being part of a common intention to fulfill the purpose of a scheme such as this is in itself criminal. Senator Gerstein tried to interfere with Deloitte by going to a contact within Deloitte to see whether or not its report could be stopped on the shady basis that Mr. Duffy was paying back the expenses and that somehow or another the matter would be moot. However, Deloitte said it would be going ahead but told him that it would not come up with a firm finding on the question of residency. That gave the PMO an advantage with respect to the rest of its scheme; that is, it told them how to go about obstructing the rest without pushing Deloitte any further. It is very clear that this was interference with respect to Deloitte in a way that assisted the broader scheme. If it turns out that what is said in the affidavit is true, I think there is more than enough evidence in that 80-page affidavit for Senator Gerstein to be charged with being part of the scheme.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483355">I would also like to mention something else that is separate. Members should keep in mind that some things may have only gone so far and did not quite get completed. That might also include Senator Gerstein. Members should also keep in mind that attempting an offence is itself a crime under section 24 of the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483356">I will now turn to what happened after the scheme initially occurred. There was then evidence beginning to emerge and there was what one would call a cover-up. There is a whole section in the Criminal Code called Misleading Justice. Section 131 of the Criminal Code speaks to perjury. Perjury is not only something that happens when people tell an untruth in a court of law. Section 131(1) states:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483357">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> Subject to subsection (3), every one commits perjury who, with intent to mislead, makes before a person who is authorized by law to permit it to be made before him a false statement under oath or solemn affirmation, by affidavit...</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483358">Therefore, the statements taken by the RCMP and revealed in this affidavit fall exactly within the scope of this provision. I would draw everyone's attention to how the RCMP has placed square-bracketed comments throughout that document, explaining in a number of cases that it clearly feels that somebody providing testimony did not tell the truth. I have to say that one of the highlights in the affidavit, from the RCMP's perspective, was that Senator LeBreton was not telling the truth. That was specifically in the affidavit. Perjury is also a crime, as is obstruction of justice. I will not go into the details.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483359">Finally, I will get to the lawyers. It is an unethical practice for any lawyer to knowingly be involved in assisting a criminal offence such as may have happened in this case. I hope that there are members of the legal profession who will be drawing this to the attention of the respective law societies of the lawyers involved.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3483393">This has become such a major story that people are calling it Duffygate. I do not necessarily want to make comparisons, but the similarities with the not-so-distant Nixon years are troubling. At the start, no one would have believed that the American president was involved. Instead, fingers were pointed at those around him, in particular his chief of staff, Harry Robbins Haldeman, who resigned. We still do not know if Nigel Wright resigned or was fired.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483394">The American Senate investigated and promised to punish those responsible. It was discovered that the president's inner circle lobbied to have reports regarding the involvement of the president and those around him modified. Nixon's popularity plummeted and people began to consider the likely scenario that he was involved and might have to leave the White House. Next came the impeachment motion, but Nixon resigned in August 1974, before the vote took place and after releasing a recording of his telephone calls that clearly proved his involvement. That was the final blow. Does anyone see any similarities here?</ParaText>

For some very important years, these young people had no one to turn to, no assistance for housing, no one to help them through high school, and no one to help them eat, sleep, or live safely. It is not surprising that a lot of these young people ended up on the streets, became involved with drugs or prostitution, or just gave up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483409">These kids are from across all demographic spectra, and many have faced physical, emotional, and sexual abuse; abandonment; mental health issues; and substance abuse. Some have never been taught age-appropriate life skills and do not know how to look after themselves properly. An increasing number are refugees or immigrants. All are suffering and seeking guidance, stability, and a caring environment in which to grow and achieve their goals. </ParaText>

He is one of the ministers to whom that rule ought to apply, so it is hard to understand how he could think he should not take responsibility for the actions of his own staff if it were the case that we were to believe he did not know what was going on, which is a little hard to believe in his case. Therefore, the cover-up continues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483654">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office fraud squad have really been the authors of a scheme whereby we have seen the bribing of a sitting senator and seen it swept under the rug until the truth leaked out by CTV's Robert Fife.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483655">I see across from me the cowering Conservative caucus members. The silence from that side today has been deafening when only one of them stood to speak to the motion. It is a remarkable thing. Aside from vitriol from the <Affiliation DbId="194836" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister</Affiliation>, no one else on that side has deigned to make a speech on this all day long.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3483657">
                <B>Hon. Geoff Regan:</B> One of them said it is not true. If that is not true, let us hear those members speak. There is a lot of time this afternoon. I hope we will hear from a number of them. They can speak on this and tell us what they really think, because we know some of them are telling the media what they think, although they are doing it anonymously. They are saying that they are concerned about this. They are not happy with the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s actions or his office, and the way this has been handled, in their view, has been slipshod. Why do they not get up now in the House this afternoon and talk about that?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483658">It is a sad day for democracy and accountability. Canadians who I have talked to in recent weeks have been shocked to see the level the government will go to cover up its misdeeds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483659">Canadian taxpayers also want to know who will take responsibility for the ethical rot that has beset the Conservative government. Let us think about that. Who should take responsibility? Should it be perhaps the person who appointed Senator Duffy? Should it be perhaps the person who hired Nigel Wright to be his chief of staff? Should it be the person who promoted the other key players involved in this corrupt scheme to seniors jobs in ministers' offices?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="05">(1505)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3483660">Sadly, the person, and we all know who we are talking about, refuses to accept any responsibility and comes up with story after story. It is an ever-changing story. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483661">It is a sad day when even Mayor Ford is more open and honest about his behaviour than his fishing buddy, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. Of course, Mayor Ford was caught and admitted it after he was caught. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483662">The fact is that nobody on the other side of the House wants to defend this ethical rot. It is clear that even Conservative backbenchers recognize that what started out as a Senate scandal has spread well beyond Duffy and Wright and has now engulfed about a dozen senior Conservatives and even the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself. It is clear, as more and more Conservative members are saying in private, that the strategy of crisis management from the Prime Minister's Office has been a disaster from day one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483663">Let me turn to something I found in this week's <I>The Hill Times</I>, which quotes senior Conservatives as saying:</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483665">These senior Conservatives were talking about the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the fact that a prime minister needs people in his or her office who challenge him or her. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483666">Could any of us in the country really imagine that from the current <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, that he would want to have that? We have a Prime Minister who has such determined control not only over his own office, but over his ministers and what they are allowed to say and even what the backbenchers are allowed to say. Everything has to be approved by the PMO.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483667">It is clear to me that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is not interested in having the kind of people in his office that these senior Conservatives are suggesting he ought to have. Apparently he knows better than anybody else and does not need to have anybody's advice or anyone really challenging him. That is not good enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483668">There is another angle to this that we have not heard a lot about. That is how what we had here last winter was a problem for the Conservative Party. It was a Conservative Party political PR problem. What was it solved with? It was solved with a $90,000 contribution. Of course, any individual in Canada can make a maximum contribution to a political party of $1,200, so we know that $90,000 is an illegal contribution. That is in addition to the other aspects of this in terms of making payment to a senator to make some kind of a deal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483669">Let us go through the record, which clearly shows that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is not being completely open and honest with Canadians about his involvement in this corrupt cover-up scheme. The Prime Minister says that he never knew anything. He heard no evil, saw no evil and spoke no evil. Nigel Wright's own words show that this is unbelievable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483670">On February 22, an email, let us call it email the first one on that day, went from Mr. Wright. He said he wanted to “speak to the PM before everything is considered final”. An hour later or thereabouts, we had a second email. He said “We are good to go with the PM”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483671">Most Canadians and most sensible people would say that he must have spoken to the PM during that hour. There must have been a conversation between Nigel Wright and the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> between those two emails. It sure sounds like the Prime Minister gave the okay.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483672">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> claims that all he ever said was that Mr. Duffy had to make the repayment himself. If that were the case, surely he had been saying that for days and even weeks before February 22. Surely he had made that very clear already, so why would Nigel Wright have to go to him to get him to approve what he had already been saying had to happen? That does not make much sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483673">The only thing that really makes sense is that Nigel Wright went to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, told him, it seems, that the Conservative Party was prepared to pay $30,000 at that point to pay off Mr. Duffy's debt, which would be equally improper. It would appear the Prime Minister thought that was okay. It was good to go. The Prime Minister gave the thumbs up.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="10">(1510)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3483674">That is certainly the interpretation that most sensible people would take from those two emails. It is hard to imagine any other conceivable interpretation. Talk about a smoking gun.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483675">What about Nigel Wright's statement to the RCMP? He said, “The PM knows, in broad terms only, that I personally assisted Duffy when I was getting him to agree to repay the expenses”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483676">That one statement makes it crystal clear that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> knew that Wright personally assisted Duffy. It leaves not a lot of doubt. It is clear that, as the RCMP alleges, Conservative operatives in the Prime Minister's Office and the Prime Minister's hand-picked Senate leaders either broke the law or took part in a cover-up designed to make the scandal go away. That is shameful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483677">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s story regarding the PMO ethics scandal has fallen apart. This is obviously a very serious issue, and hence the motion today, which is very appropriate. Today's motion talks about the PMO fraud squad's potential and criminal cover-up in a series of events that the RCMP believes may have violated three sections of the Criminal Code, not to mention the Elections Act in terms of election spending or donations to political parties, which effectively this was.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483678">Today's motion also talks about the role of senior Conservative operatives and senior senators, hand-picked by the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister.</Affiliation>, who participated in a whitewash of a Senate report and apparently attempted to influence an independent audit being conducted by Deloitte. The record is pretty clear on that as well. We have seen lots of reports on this in the media. They come directly from the documents obtained by the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483679">The list of suspects in this caper is indeed long and probably going to grow. On the Senate side there are Senators Carolyn Stewart Olsen, Marjory LeBreton, David Tkachuk, Irving Gerstein, and, of course, former Conservative poster boy Mike Duffy. In the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister.</Affiliation>r's Office, either now or formerly, we have Nigel Wright, Benjamin Perrin, Ray Novak, Chris Woodcock, Patrick Rogers, and David van Hemmen. A bunch of them have been promoted since this all took place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483680">It is quite a twisted story, with a lot of conflicting accounts that need to be cleared up so that Canadians can have confidence in Parliament. That is why there ought to be hearings on this and testimony from people such as the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister.</Affiliation></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483681">For instance, Senator Duffy said in a statement from the Senate that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s former chief of staff, Nigel Wright, had provided assurances to him that his behaviour was acceptable and that he would give him a $90,000 cheque to cover the Prime Minister's tracks. Senator Duffy also confirmed that he was told to take the $90,000, keep his mouth shut, and go along with the cover-up or the Conservatives would kick him out of the Senate. That is the threat that he alluded to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483682">We are here today pushing for more transparency. We have been pushing the Conservatives for that for quite a while. We are here today trying to get to the truth for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483683">Of course, there are many other things we ought to be discussing in the House of Commons. Canadians have many other concerns, such as job creation; youth unemployment; the environment; pipeline issues; the debt loads of individual Canadians, which are very high; the cost of post-secondary education; the situation in Syria; and the new agreement with Iran and the government's attitude toward it. There are these things and many others. The Auditor General's report released today expresses concern about the basic safety measures that are supposed to be overseen by the government, especially when it comes to rail and food safety. We have seen things like the listeriosis crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483684">However, instead of talking about these important things, we are mired in this scandal. Why are we still talking about this scandal? Why are we mired as we are? It is because the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> refuses to answer questions. He refuses to come clean. He refuses to allow the House to hold a hearing and to testify under oath about what he knew and did not know and what happened here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483685">That is all he has to do: testify. It is time for the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to speak under oath and tell the truth. That would get us on to other things, I would hope.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483686">The <Affiliation DbId="194836" Type="18">Prime Minister's parliamentary secretary </Affiliation>has been here today showing contempt for hard-working Canadian taxpayers, as he has shown, unfortunately, in question period for weeks. Really, he and the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> are showing contempt for the values their party once prided itself on and on values the Reform Party also prided itself on.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="15">(1515)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3483687">Of course, the <Affiliation DbId="194836" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> has memorized the words that the kids in short pants in the Prime Minister's Office have given him to say. He has memorized them very well, and the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his parliamentary secretary would like nothing more than to sweep this whole affair under the rug. That, of course, was the original idea when Nigel Wright and others in the PMO were overseeing what was happening in the Senate and trying to manage this whole thing so that it not only would not come out in the Deloitte report but also so that the Senate committee, they hoped, would whitewash it after Deloitte had done so. Thankfully, in the end that did not happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483688"> It is clear that this scandal falls squarely on the shoulders of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.

              <ParaText id="3483690">The Liberals seem to be saying on one hand they would really like to see transparency, but on the other hand they do not provide transparency. I have been here since 2006, and I have never heard a Liberal member stand up and say, “We demand to know which Quebec Liberal riding associations got illegal sponsorship money. We would like to have Elections Canada look into this and determine it”. They have never once said that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483691"> When at least three of their members were caught charging rent to this place, the House of Commons, and paying it to their children, which is contrary to the rules of this Parliament, the Liberal Party actually participated in covering that up by allowing the members to simply pay it back and sweeping it under the rug. The information was completely covered up and kept from taxpayers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483692">If the Liberals really want to have this kind of transparency, why will they not stand up and demand it of their own members? Why will they not demand accountability for Colin Kenny?</ParaText>

It talked about the inability of government to move and said basically that the government was either in the hands of the far right or the far left, that both of those groups had far too much influence, as I think can happen with that system and the coalitions that result. The government's survival can depend upon a small group with an extreme point of view. The result is that it does not move forward in a way that represents what most people want.</ParaText>

The PMO, unlike the Senate, would be easy to abolish. It is just a question of how much money the House, this Parliament in charge of the public purse, is prepared to allow an unaccountable partisan operation that bullies and oppresses people throughout the system to be allowed to continue to exist.</ParaText>

Despite the fact that the Conservatives have many speaking spots, they chose instead to remain silent. Silence speaks volumes to the command and control style of the Prime Minister's Office. This party, whose leadership day in and day out pretends to stand up for right and wrong, is today the party that is silent in the face of potential criminal activity in the Prime Minister's Office. This party, whose leadership pretends to be tough on crime and holding others to account, remains silent today. We can only conclude that the muzzle has been applied to backbench MPs.</ParaText>

Yet, I am convinced that at some point the PMO muzzle will eventually be replaced with voices seeking some accountability. I said two weks ago when we debated a similar motion calling on the Prime Minister to testify under oath that there is a great many good and decent Conservatives on the backbench. They were elected to be the voice of their constituents. I submit that they have a right to speak today.</ParaText>

They are not parliamentary secretaries appointed by the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. They are not ministers in the government appointed by the Prime Minister. They are not committee chairs appointed by the Prime Minister. They are the backbone of the caucus.

Although many would perhaps like to have one of these high offices and positions, they remain, for the moment, loyal to their party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483728">However, what they were not elected to do was to be props for the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. They were not elected to clap on cue as directed by the front bench. That is not the role of an MP.</ParaText>

They know that this scandal should not have happened and they understand that the current <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has allowed this scandal to distract from other issues facing their constituents. They understand because they represent their constituents, not the Prime Minister. They know that all of this secrecy and doublespeak raises serious questions about the leadership of the Prime Minister, yet today, of all days to have a voice, Conservative MPs are silent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483730">However, I am asking that my colleagues from the Conservative caucus be bold. I am asking them to make the tough decision to do what is right.

According to that machine, all that matters is the one passage confirming the Prime Minister was unaware of the $90,000 personal cheque. Amazingly, the PMO is so insular that it would seem they actually believe the document exonerates the Prime Minister.</QuotePara>

But this story ceased to be about Nigel Wright and Mike Duffy weeks ago. As salacious as a millionaire paying the ineligible debts of a now-expelled Senator might be, the bigger story is what their transaction (and who knew or didn’t know what and when) says about how business is conducted in Ottawa.</QuotePara>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Section 119 of the Criminal Code makes it an indictable offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison to offer or accept “any money [or] valuable consideration” to a Member of Parliament “in respect of anything done or omitted […] in their official capacity.”</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="3483749">I think it is fair to say that all of us within the Liberal caucus feel very strongly that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> should testify, under oath, in this particular circumstance. It is also quite obvious that in doing so, the same level of control would not be there for the government. Maybe that is one of the reasons it has not supported this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483750">I want to ask my colleague how this is playing out in his home province of P.E.I., which we know has been in the news a lot as it relates to this particular issue. What has been the opinion of the hard-working, law-abiding citizens of Prince Edward Island when it comes to this particular scandal around the PMO and the Senate?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483751">I would also like to ask my colleague, who has been practising law in this country for quite a number of years, what his opinion would be of how such ethical practices would be looked upon by those within the Law Society or within the practice of law in comparison with how we are seeing these things dealt with within the PMO and within the government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3483752">Mr. Speaker, there is, indeed, a lot in that question. I regret that I have only a minute to deal with it. It is also somewhat awkward. I realize that out of respect for parliamentary tradition, I have to speak through the Speaker to the member who is sitting beside and behind me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483753">I go door to door one day a month in my riding, and the response from Prince Edward Islanders has been consistent and damning. Not only are they disgusted with the conduct within the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office, but they are, frankly, embarrassed that Prince Edward Island has been cast in this light because the Prime Minister decided to appoint someone from Kanata to a Prince Edward Island seat. That is the first part of the question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483754">The second part is with respect to a tie-in with what is happening here and my previous career as a practising lawyer. Members would know that the practice of law is built on integrity. It is built on someone having complete faith that when something is said to a lawyer, it will be held in confidence. That is why, in the practice of law, if any comment is made, for example, to you, Mr. Speaker, by a client, all of your partners are deemed to know it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483755">Interestingly, we have something that is, arguably, akin to that in <I>A Guide for Ministers and Ministers of State</I>, where it says that “Ministers and Ministers of State are personally responsible for the conduct and operation of their offices and the exempt staff in their employ”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483756">It is also quite telling that when Nigel Wright answered the question, he said that he acted within the scope of his employment. We, as lawyers, would know that acting within the scope of one's employment triggers vicarious liability, as opposed to being on a frolic of one's own.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483757">What I would say is that the rules within the practice of law are built to maintain the integrity of those who practise. It is quite clear that no such rules are being applied in this case, whether they exist or not, and that speaks very poorly to the integrity within the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office.</ParaText>

For Prince Edward Island, the mandate of the Senate, when established, was to protect the smallest provinces. It is very important for my province that the Senate not be abolished. However, there are obviously problems to tackle and things to improve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483764">It is vital that we listen to Canadians, especially those living in the smallest provinces. For example, if the Senate were abolished, Prince Edward Island would have fewer than four MPs and no senators. That is a great concern for us.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3483766">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise and speak on what I think is a very important issue for all Canadians. In fact, I have had the opportunity to do a lot of door-knocking, as many other members have, and I can say that it is an issue that is top of mind for many Canadians, I would argue, from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483767">I must say that I am a little disappointed in the official opposition. I think that the NDP has dropped the ball in that this is not about Senate reform. The issue before us deals with the alleged fraud that has taken place in the Prime Minister's Office. That is what we need to focus our attention on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483768">Canadians want the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to be straightforward and to tell the full truth as to what has taken place. The NDP can continue to debate the Senate, something they know they will never be able to realize, but they are missing the point here today. What we are talking about today is how critically important it is that the Prime Minister of our country come before Canadians and explain exactly what, in full detail, he knows. We are not going to settle for anything less.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483769">I find it very interesting that there was an opportunity for five Conservative speakers to stand and talk about the motion. They chose not to do that. One member of the Conservative caucus, the one responsible for damage control on the fraud that has taken place in the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170339" Type="2">Oak Ridges—Markham</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="194836" Type="18">parliamentary secretary to the Prime Minister</Affiliation>, has been the human shield who has been trying to deflect a very serious issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483770">Now we see that the glass bubble around the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office has made it very clear that if one is a Conservative member of Parliament, one does not stand up and deal with the issue before us today. That is the reason we have not seen one Conservative MP, other than the one responsible for damage control, stand and attempt to defend the Prime Minister or express what he or she feels is going on or went on in the Prime Minister's Office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483771">The leader of the Liberal Party talks a lot about how important it is that as members of Parliament, we are supposed to go into the constituencies and bring constituents' concerns to Ottawa. He contrasts that with the Conservative government, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and this PMO, which do the absolute opposite.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483772">The PMO's instructions are very clear. As a member of Parliament for the Conservative Party, one does not represent one's constituents in Ottawa; one represents Ottawa in one's constituency. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has that wrong, and we are seeing it today, because none of them are standing up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483773">I knocked on doors in Brandon and talked to people. I talked to people in Provencher and to my own constituents in Winnipeg North. One of the issues that came up time and time again was the issue of the Prime Minister's Office and what has been taking place there. I can say that they just do not believe the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. They do not believe that the Prime Minister has been straightforward and is telling the full truth regarding what has taken place in what some call the Senate scandal. I think it is more of a PMO scandal than it is a Senate scandal. We need to be very clear on that particular point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483774">No doubt there were a number of factors in what took place in the province of Manitoba last night. It was an exciting time when we saw a very clear indication that Manitobans are looking at abandoning the Conservative Party. Even in areas where it traditionally had good strength, they are looking for an alternative.</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483778">That is all we are asking for. Why are the Conservatives so fearful of being able to address that issue? Why are the Conservatives so concerned that they are not prepared to stand in their place and take a position on this particular motion?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483779">If the Conservatives wanted to canvass their constituents to see what they had to say and were to share those thoughts with the House today, I suspect this particular motion would indeed pass.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483780"> It has been a very interesting process. We call it the “fraud squad”, coming out of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office. It is amazing, the types of personalities that are actually involved. We talked about Nigel Wright. RCMP Corporal Greg Horton has ultimately alleged that Mr. Wright in fact broke the law with that payment of $90,000. This is coming from the RCMP. It is very serious.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483781">Who was Wright at the time? He was the chief of staff for the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office. That means he was the go-to person. There was no one closer to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. Well, possibly his wife is. The point is that this is an individual who carried a great deal of influence here in Canada. He had the ear of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. That is just one person.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483782">Remember, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> initially said that it was only one person, only Nigel Wright, who knew anything about it and that he was disappointed that Nigel Wright kept it from him, and so forth. That is what the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483783">Of course we found out that it is not true. A lot of people knew about it. A number of weeks ago, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said it was a few people. On my plane ride back to Winnipeg on Friday, I took a snap of something on the Internet. I wanted to try to get a better sense of how many people were actually around. It is quite impressive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483784">We can talk about some of the senators at play who would have known. Obviously, Senator Duffy would have been one of them. He is in fact the key man here. We have Senator Tkachuk. He was the chair of the Senate standing committee. Remember the bit of a whitewash attempt that was being done there? We have Senator Stewart Olsen, again, a member of that particular standing committee. We have Senator LeBreton, government leader in the Senate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483785">These are all senators who knew about it, who we know knew about it. What amazes me is the individuals who worked for the PMO. There are individuals like Mr. Perrin, a lawyer, former PMO lawyer, who knew about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483786">What about the PMO staffer who now works for the <Affiliation DbId="170686" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation>, Mr. Woodcock? He was engaged and actually very much aware of what was going on. Again, he was working for the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.

              <ParaText id="3483789">What about another PMO staffer's involvement, Mr. Rogers? Again, he now works for a leading minister from Manitoba.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483790">We can talk about Mr. Hilton, who is the Conservative Party executive director, who was also engaged.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483791">We also had Mr. Hamilton, the Conservative Party lawyer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483792">What about Senator Gerstein? He is the fundraiser. Many refer to him as the bagman for the Conservative Party. I believe he was the individual who made a connection call with regard to the audit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483793">Those were just some of the individuals I was able to kind of pull together, primarily because of news agencies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483794">Andrew MacDougall is another individual, the director of communications for the PMO. Christopher Montgomery is now responsible for issues management for the government in the Senate. Ray Novak is the deputy chief of staff to the PM.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483795">Last week, prior to going out to Winnipeg, I talked about Jenni Byrne. She is the deputy chief of staff today, I understand. She had some prime ministerial responsibilities that had to be conducted in Brandon, I understand. She worked very closely with individuals like Dan Hilton and Senator Gerstein.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483796">It is a pretty impressive group. We do not know to what degree or how big the fraud squad really was, at the time. We do not know all of the personalities who were engaged. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483797">All I know is we have the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who says there was only one. If I do a quick count, there are a lot more than one. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483798">Yes, a number of months later, he did admit that there were more than one. There were a few.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483799">We believe that there were a lot more than just a few. That is one of the reasons we are challenging the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to come forward and start telling the full truth about who knew, what they knew and when they knew it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483800">These are not just average party Conservatives who we would find in some annual meetings. These are individuals who have been elevated to the highest levels within the Conservative Party, within the Prime Minister's Office. These are the elite who the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself would have, in many cases, appointed or had confidence in. It seems to be a fairly big circle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483801">What is the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> saying? He is trying to convince Canadians that he knew nothing about it. That is a hard one to accept.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483802">One member from the other side finally speaks up and he says, “Accept it”. I do not accept it, and I do not believe Canadians are buying it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483803">It is interesting.

              <ParaText id="3483808">I suspect the reason they are not doing that is that there is a credibility issue here, and there are very few within the Conservative ranks who are prepared to stand up in a public fashion and tell it as it is; and that is that there is something wrong here and we are not getting the full truth from the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3483815">There is one very compelling aspect that I found personally in reviewing some of the emails that were provided through the investigative work of Corporal Greg Horton from the RCMP. There were three emails to which I would like to refer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483816">On February 21, Benjamin Perrin, one of the fraud squad group, stated that the Prime Minister's personal lawyer in the PMO and Senator Duffy's lawyer exchanged emails detailing the plan to have the Conservative Party pay Duffy $32,000 in bogus housing claims, as well as his legal fees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483817">The agreement describes this as keeping Duffy “whole on the repayment”. That was on February 21.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483818">On February 22, Wright confirmed with Gerstein, the fundraiser for the party. In essence what took place is that Wright confirmed with Gerstein that the party would pay the expenses and the legal fees. Later on the same day, Wright emailed Perrin and stated, “I do want to speak to the PM before everything is considered final”. Less than an hour later, Wright sent a follow-up email to Perrin and said, “We are good to go from the PM once Ben has confirmation from Payne”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483819">Canadians have not been told the full truth as to what has actually taken place. We know there have been serious allegations of laws having been broken.

              <ParaText id="3483821">Mr. Speaker, I really am compelled to comment on what I regard as disgraceful comments from the member opposite.

              <ParaText id="3483823">The fact is that the RCMP has not even suggested any criminal conduct against anyone other than Mr. Duffy and Mr. Wright.

Never before has a prime minister had such absolute control over his backbenchers. We have seen how effective he can be. With one statement out of the PMO, he can silence all 100-plus of them. Not one of them outside of the one who is responsible for damage control has actually stood in his or her place to deal with the issue in the form of debate. Yes, questions were asked, but only the man responsible for damage control has been allowed to speak today.

              <ParaText id="3483848">Mr. Speaker, I guess one has to go over this and explain it very slowly, over and over, before the penny drops across the way with the Conservative caucus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483849">This Liberal motion has followed the thread of the RCMP investigation, the timelines of that investigation, with emails and affidavits that show that on February 21, 2013, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> asked Senator Duffy to repay his expenses. Nobody has a problem with that. Everyone thinks that is fair. That is what the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> should have asked him and that is what he should have done. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483850">Then the very next day, February 22, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s chief of staff wanted to speak to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> before everything was considered final, and he did. He got confirmation from the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office, according to the RCMP affidavits, that in fact things were good to go once the PM had got confirmation from the lawyers, Benjamin Perrin and Janice Payne. This is an important piece of the thread that we need to talk about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483851">The PM was aware that his lawyers were looking at this, that there was something going on and discussions were obviously going on between Mr. Duffy to repay his expenses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483852">Suddenly the amount for Senator Duffy's expenses was larger than everybody thought and then the tactic changed and it was suddenly an arrangement between Nigel Wright and Senator Duffy, when Mr. Wright paid it out of his own personal expenses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483853">After the $90,000, which was paid by Nigel Wright, it was found, again, according to the RCMP affidavits, that the PMO was engaged in what should be called, and what it calls it, obstruction of the Deloitte audit and the whitewash of the Senate report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483854">We have two other things in which the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office seemed to be involved. The question is that the RCMP, looking at these emails and affidavits, concluded that it believed, according to that thread of information, that there was a violation of sections 119, 121 and 122 of the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483855">This is clear. This is not made up. This is fact. These are affidavits. The questions we are asking, and a lot of people on this of the House are asking, is this. Did the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> know about this? Is he fully aware? Some of the emails say that up to a particular point, when it comes to whether his lawyers were okay about it, that he seemed to have known and then suddenly the communication stopped. Nobody decided to talk to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> after that. Everything just disappeared.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483856">This is really unbelievable. It is illogical, to say the least. I am not a lawyer. It seems to me suddenly strange that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had his lawyers involved and then, kaboom, nobody wanted to talk to the Prime Minister after this. He did not know what was going on. He was absolutely deaf and could not hear or people kept him out of the loop. This is the question we are asking. These things do not make sense, and we want to make sense of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483857">If they are simple, if they are explicable, if the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> can say this is true, why does everybody just say they have a great explanation for why the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> suddenly, after his lawyers were involved and he said “good to go”, he was shut out of everything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483858">There should be an explanation. If the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is clear about all this, he could stand and say that he could explain it all. However, we are not getting these explanations.

Why can he not just answer the question, if it is clear and if the answers are reasonable and fair? Here is another thing. Why did the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office intervene in the Senate? We not only heard that it intervened in terms of whitewashing a report, we also found out that people from the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office were in the room when the two co-chairs of the Senate were discussing the report. It is unbelievable that the House of Commons would be there in the room discussing a Senate report with the chairs of the Senate. This House is not supposed to interfere in that place over there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483861">Here we go, we find this interference going on. Then again we find out that there was a question and an email flow that told us that people were asking Senator Gerstein to try to intervene in the Deloitte report so that it could be modified, moderated, whatever they want to call it. I am trying to be kind here with my language and trying not to be obnoxious with it. I am just saying “moderated” or “modified”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483862">However, this also is tampering. This is interfering. These are the things that we want to know. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483863">Was there something that people wanted to hide? Why did they want to tamper with the Deloitte report? Did they want to hide something? Why did they tamper with the Senate chairs' report? When the Senate met, the committee had a report. The chairs do not usually tamper with committee reports. There would be heck to pay if our chairs tampered with our committee reports here in the House. Why would that happen there? We have to conclude there is something to hide, that there is something that is irregular and therefore people do not want it to come out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483864">Those are some of the questions that we are asking in the House. They are simple questions. They should give us simple answers, if everything is above board.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483865">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> says he did not know, and everyone in the House has said that is unbelievable, for a Prime Minister who controls every word that comes out of the mouths of his ministers, his parliamentary secretaries and his backbenchers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483866">We are not making this up. Backbenchers who have walked away from the Conservative Party have subsequently said that they had been muzzled, that they did not like the fact that they were being told what to say, especially some of them who came from the old Reform Party and remain there, who felt that they ran on openness and all the accountability that Preston Manning believed in. They felt in some ways that this did not sit well with them, so some of them left. Some of them refused to run again and they said why. Some of them have left and are now sitting in the House as independent members. As members heard today, they still hold a Conservative card, believe in Conservative values and want to be Conservatives. They just do not like what the Prime Minister's Office is doing, how it has muzzled them and kept everybody quiet, and how the talking points must be exactly as they are told.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483867"> This is why I must conclude, in all my innocence, that the only reason we are getting anyone answering questions or anyone standing up and saying anything in the House is that it is the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s parliamentary secretary, who has been here with his little script. He repeats his script every day and adds to it some insults for everyone else in the House, to change the channel and deflect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483868">The question here is simply this. Did the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> know? Most of us around here find it very difficult to understand or to believe that this Prime Minister did not know what was going on, and that suddenly doors slammed shut and communications ended on February 22 when his lawyers became involved and all of that, and he wanted to talk with his lawyers. Suddenly everything went blank or whatever happened. Whether the Prime Minister went to sleep like Rip Van Winkle and only woke up in May when this whole thing broke loose, I do not know. However, we find it hard to believe that the Prime Minister did not know.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483869">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> also stood in the House when he was the leader of an opposition party and asked the former prime minister a very simple question. He said that it was unconscionable, and if the former prime minister didn't know, it was incompetent. I apply that same question across the way. Did the Prime Minister know? If he did know, indeed it has to be unconscionable, according to his own words and to his own moral compass. If he did not know then it is incompetence. What CEO of any company would have his top executives, 12 of them in this case, and his right-hand man in this case, especially since he knew about it on February 22 when his lawyers were involved, carry on under his nose and know absolutely nothing about it, and tell us that he absolutely did not know?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3483873">Therefore, whether the Prime Minister knew or did not know, he is personally responsible. He has to take the heat for whatever went on. He said so on page 28 of his own memo to ministers and ministers of state. This is his ethical code, so why is he not taking responsibility? Why is he blaming everyone else? I am not making this up. This comes out of the Prime Minister's mouth. Is the Prime Minister going to stand by his own words or is he going to try to weasel out of them somehow, and say, “I saw no evil, I heard no evil and I therefore speak no evil because it's all not about me at all”?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483874">This is incompetence from any CEO, in a small company, a big company or an international corporation. This is clear incompetence. These are some of the questions that we are asking. </ParaText>

That is what his party ran on, saying that was what it was going to bring to what it considered a House full of duplicity, et cetera. The Conservatives were coming in. They were going to form government and be open and transparent and accountable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483876">If I had about an hour I might go down the list of all the times that the Conservatives were not open and not transparent and not accountable, starting with budgets and with the Parliamentary Budget Officer having to take the government to court, or the Privacy Commissioner having to ask them to divulge information. We have seen this. I do not have to go down the list. This is now history, this pattern of behaviour. The modus operandi of the government is to keep as much secrecy as it can. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483877">I might add, it is a pity it cannot keep secrecy for Canadians. When Canadians have medical information and such, it seems to be able to throw that one out, but it sure knows how to keep its little backroom deals secret. I just thought I would throw that in for good measure. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483878">We are asking the Prime Minister to, under oath, stand up and tell Canadians what Mr. Wright, or any member of his staff or other Conservative, told him at any time about the whole Duffy affair and his expenses and what happened. What did they tell him about interference with the Senate report? What did they tell him about trying to water down the Deloitte report, or whatever happened when they talked to the Deloitte people? What did he know about that? When did he know about it? He said he did not know anything about it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483879">We have this whole confusion from everyone around who says they do not believe him. Two out of 10 Canadians are the only ones who believe him. About 80% of Canadians do not seem to believe what he is saying. This is purely because of this man's behaviour, the fact that he has been very controlling and suddenly, on February 22, he said he was good to go provided his lawyers who were involved were okay with it.

              <ParaText id="3483882">We have a couple of questions to ask. These questions are very simple. Let us go back, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> continues to say that the senators are bad, the senators are all wrong, the Senate is horrible and the Senate is a bad place, but this <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> embraced the Senate when he became Prime Minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483883">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> came here saying that he was going to reform it, but he did not because he was trying to reform it through the back door and not through Constitutional requirements. He could not get anywhere with that. Now, he embraced it wholeheartedly to the extent that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> appointed two senators whom everyone knew, for the last 25 years, did not live in the provinces they were supposed to represent. Is that not going to create a problem? Suddenly these senators were going to have to find a primary residence in those places, and they did, indeed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483884">My colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170158" Type="2">Malpeque</Affiliation>, talked about how Prince Edward Islanders were absolutely embarrassed and appalled, and how the person who owned the house that Senator Duffy bought was ashamed and embarrassed that a picture of their little cottage was being seen all the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483885">Somewhere at the beginning the rot began. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> put people into the Senate to represent provinces that they had not lived in. Now they have to hurry and go find primary residences and make up stories about primary residences and bill according to primary residence. How did that happen? The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> obviously either did not know what he was doing when he did it, or he did know and he had a secondary reason for appointing these two senators. We all know what the reason was. These were the two biggest fundraisers for the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. They went all over the place. They were celebrities. People flocked to listen to them, blah, blah, blah. We know all of that. That is common knowledge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483886">Here is a <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who took advantage of the situation for his own gain and his party's gain. Now all of a sudden, he did not know how all this happened. He could not understand why these wondrous people who did not live in their provinces in the first place could suddenly do such a thing. Again, it defies common sense, simple common sense, people do not have to be lawyers to understand. It defies common sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483887">Why did this chain of communication end suddenly? Can someone on the backbench get up during questions and comments and answer why the door shut on communications after February 22, and left this big void. Then all of a sudden the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> found out, and it was oh, my gosh, shock and surprise, shock and awe, he did not know about it. Suddenly he found out about it and what a wonderful man like Nigel Wright had done, this good deed. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> praised him to the skies, and then suddenly he stopped praising him to the skies and said he did not know and it was terrible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483888">These are some of the questions that we want to ask. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> seemed to change his story. That is another thing. In question period, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, over a period of time, moving aside the RCMP affidavits and emails that seemed to implicate the Prime Minister, said he did not know yet, he could not understand how that could happen, when the emails tell a different story.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483889">Suddenly the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, as we say colloquially, threw everyone under the bus, including Mr. Wright, whom he had first said he reluctantly took his resignation. Then all of a sudden he had fired him. Then he went back to saying he reluctantly took his resignation. I do not know what to believe anymore. My head is spinning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483890">Why would the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> not agree to do this, to just openly report the truth to the citizens of this country? Why not? I do not understand the problem. I do not understand why he would not do this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483891">The other question I have to ask is this. If all of these people kept the truth from him, “deceived” him that way, why did he promote them to minister's offices? Why? Is this a patting on the back for a job well done? What is this? Is this a shut up and I will give you a better job? What is this? I do not know. We want answers. The motion is seeking to get those answers. I am hoping that the motion will pass, and everyone in the House believes that it is time to tell Canadians the truth.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3483898">Second, I will answer the member's question as to whether I know what my staff are doing every moment of the day in my office. The answer is that I do not. I must say, though, that if they do something wrong, I will continue to own up and take responsibility for what they have done, as I have in the past, because when they do all of the great things that I get credit for, I accept it. Therefore, if they do something, I will not throw them under the bus. That is what a responsible boss does.

              <ParaText id="3483901">As we have come to discover, the Senate is being used by both the Liberals and the Conservatives for partisan political activities on the taxpayer's dime. We in the NDP put forward a motion not too long ago asking that the practice of doing partisan fundraising activities and the like on the taxpayer's dime cease. There are several Liberal senators out there who are doing that on a regular basis, and the Liberals have voted against that motion, so they seem to agree that it is a good thing for the Senate and that it is acceptable for taxpayers' money to be used for political fundraising. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3483905">The Liberals did not vote for the bill to abolish the Senate because we understand the rule of law. We adhere to the rule of law in this House.

I think it is fair to say that they have talked constantly over the last several weeks about the big scandals, because there are several going on, and then, of course, there is another large one going on in Toronto.

It is amazing to ponder that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> cannot answer these simple questions, but they are not just simple. They are essential questions. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3483932">They go to the core of how this place works. They go to the core of the public's trust in government. I can tell the House that this trust has been shaken very deeply. I am in my riding of Davenport constantly, and I hear very little else about politics these days other than the scandal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483933">We can all agree that this puts a pall over all of us. It is incumbent on everyone here that we endeavour to get to the bottom of these issues. Obfuscation is not helping us in this pursuit, especially because we have so many other pressing issues. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483934">We can talk about some of the Senate appointees and the role of the Senate. Our position in the NDP and the official opposition is clear. It has been clear for 40 years. We feel that the Senate has long outlived its usefulness and should be abolished. It is important to remember that other jurisdictions in Canada once had senates. The province where I come from, Ontario, once had a Senate. We no longer have a senate, and democracy still lives in Ontario. I believe that it will thrive here, notwithstanding a few people's hurt feelings over the ending of the Senate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483935">We have really important issues to deal with, issues the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is not speaking to, as well as the fact that he is not speaking to the scandal before us. We need to get to the bottom of this, hear from the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and hear a clear explanation about what happened. We are past the point where we are prepared to hear little dribbles and nuggets of half-truths. We need the full truth, in part because we have so much to do. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483936">We have the issue of climate change. We still have not got to the bottom of where the heck that $3.1 billion went from the last budget, which seems to have disappeared. That is on top of the $50 million to build a gazebo for the minister during the G20 summit, where the Auditor General said proper accounting was not pursued. We are still waiting for the paperwork on that. We are still waiting to find that $3.1 billion. How does anyone lose $3.1 billion? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483937">The Conservative government likes to spin that it is fiscally prudent. It has posted the largest deficit in Canadian history. It cannot find $3.1 billion. It is trying to sell this canard to Canadians that it is somehow a prudent fiscal manager. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483938">If we take a look at the Government of Manitoba, which has posted serial balanced budgets over four majority mandates, we see what fiscal prudence is all about and why Canadians can be assured that an NDP government would manage the economy in the most fiscally prudent way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483939">That said, the Conservative government has piled scandal upon scandal. I have already mentioned the $50-million gazebo. There was the robocall scandal. The biggest scandal is how the government has been asleep at the switch on job creation. It talks about the jobs it has created, but it never ever talks about what kinds of jobs they are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483940">I am in my riding all the time knocking on doors and hearing from people. People cannot live, raise a family, and pay rent in a city like Toronto with a minimum wage job. That is why so many people are working multiple jobs. We wonder how it was that voter turnout, for example in the by-election last night, was as low as it was in many of these by-elections.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3483941">People are working all hours. They are working split shifts. They are working multiple jobs, multiple part-time jobs. In Toronto right now, almost 50% of workers cannot find stable, full-time jobs. I thought that is why we came here. I thought we came here to try to make lives better. I thought we came here to try to make changes that would affect the most people. Instead, we have a government consumed with protecting their chosen few, some of them residing in the Senate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483942">It is worth reminding Canadians who might be listening today who some of those senators are and what their job qualifications are. In fact, since I mentioned the by-elections last night, it is worth noting that the last by-election in Toronto Centre, for example, was in March 2008. Do members know who came in fourth in that by-election in March 2008? It was the Conservative candidate. His name is Don Meredith. Guess where Don Meredith sits today? He sits in the Senate. My goodness, it is kind of cheap to get into the Senate. All one needs is 2,939 votes, which is what Mr. Meredith had in the 2008 Toronto Centre by-election. The list goes on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483943">Actually, one can spend a lot of money to get into the Senate. David Braley made donations to the Conservative Party and Stephen Harper, among others, totalling $86,000—</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3483945">My apologies, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Braley made donations to the Conservative Party and to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, among others, totalling $86,500, prior to his appointment. I would like to thank the government members for allowing me the opportunity to repeat that fact, and to repeat it in a clearer way. That is the qualification for Senator Braley's appointment to the Senate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483946">Some members, especially Liberal members, seem confused as to why we would dare to suggest that, with the gravy train the Liberals rode for so long and that the Conservatives, mirroring the Liberals, are currently enjoying, we would want to see the end of that institution. If one's qualification is that one becomes a name on a ballot as a sacrificial lamb in a Toronto Centre by-election in 2008 or has $85,000 to spare, surely we can set the bar higher than that. I think Canadians understand that the bar should be set higher, which is why the motion is so important today. It is why Canadians are so concerned about this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483947">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and members of the government like to try to slough off the questions on this. They say that they have been clear and have already told everybody the truth. They say that they have already said these things so many times. Why are Canadians bothering them with all these details? It is the details that are important. It is the details that consume Canadians' lives. It is the price of food. It is the price of rent. It is the cost of gas. It is the cost of a Metropass in Toronto. These are the details of people's lives that people are consumed with and concerned about. These are the kinds of things the government should be concerned about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483948">We asked months ago why the government was letting companies charge seniors an extra $2 just to get their bills in the mail. At the time, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> went on about a self-regulating code of conduct, as if that is some kind of comfort to seniors who are barely scraping by in expensive cities right across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483949">We want to see a government that is focused on the real needs of Canadians, on the ways that will help them live in cities that are very expensive. That includes young people who are today graduating from university. In my province of Ontario, the average student debt at the end of a four-year undergrad is $37,000. Then they are going out into a job market where they cannot find permanent jobs. Their options are serial short-term contracts, part-time work, and increasingly, unpaid internships. Now there are some excellent internship programs out there that are run well, with proper oversight, but currently, young workers are simply asked to work for free in jobs that were once entry level positions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483950">We have not seen the government budge on that issue. We have not seen any action on this issue from the government, but it has spent a lot of time on spin and has congratulated and rewarded its supporters handsomely.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483951">Donald Plett, Conservative Party president, is in the Senate too. These are the same senators who, after the House passed Jack Layton's climate change bill, a historic bill, and one we all would have been proud of, including some members on the government side, killed that bill. We are laggards in the international community when it comes to climate change. We are laggards when it comes to democracy here if we are letting an unelected Senate, filled with folks who bought their way in, failed candidates, and party presidents, both Liberal and Conservative, make those decisions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3483952">Some Liberal members and Conservative members whose close friends sit in the Senate try to make this personal, and they say to the NDP, “So-and-so is a good senator; why are you picking on him?” We are not picking on individual people. We are talking about an institution. We are talking about democracy. We are talking about how we do this. We are talking about how we bring the issues of our constituents into Parliament and how we work on those problems together and come out with solutions that help Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483953">That is why we are here. That is what we are here for. We are not here to protect parliamentarians. We are not here to protect senators who are taking advantage of the public largesse. We are not here to provide cover for them, but we also do not expect the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>—who, by the way, ran on a platform of accountability and transparency—to duck and weave and to cut and run. We do not expect that. Canadians do not expect that, especially when we have so many important issues to deal with. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483954">In my riding, right across Toronto and right across the country there are thousands upon thousands of immigrants, for example, who have been waiting years to sponsor their parents and their grandparents. They have been waiting years for that. They need answers to these questions. They come into my office, and no doubt they come into the offices of many of my colleagues, and they are wondering why the government is not processing these applications in a timely fashion. Right now it has put an actual moratorium on applications, and when it lifts the moratorium, it will only be accepting 5,000 new applicants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483955">This is the kind of thing on which we need to put our focus. We need the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to stand up in this House and take the responsibility that this motion underlines he must take.

We all know that more than 80% to 90% of human trafficking victims in Canada are trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation. The September 2013 report from the Service du renseignement criminel du Quebec revealed that the sex industry in Quebec is doing better than ever. This report highlighted a huge increase in the number of massage parlours: there are more than 200 of them in Montreal. The report states that 39% of the victims caught are minors and that 91% of the victims are women. The numbers are similar in other Canadian provinces. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3483987">Mr. Speaker, as I was saying, this is the reality in nearly every province in Canada. The average age of entry into prostitution is 14. I have met sex workers who were recruited when they were just 12 or 13 years old.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483988">According to the Criminal Intelligence Service Canada 2008 report, a pimp can earn $280,000 annually or about $900 a day from one girl. This shows just how enormous the battle before us is; it will require a great deal of political courage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483989">I urge all of my colleagues, men and women alike, to think very seriously about the kind of society we want our children to grow up in. Soon, perhaps next year, we will have to have a closer look at a fundamental question that many societies have faced recently: are we ready to legalize prostitution in Canada? We will have to answer that question, because the Supreme Court decision in Bedford v. Canada will be coming soon. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483990">I believe that Canada can lead the way on this issue in the Americas. I believe that prostitution is not a job, but rather a form of violence against women. The legalization of prostitution is a scourge in many countries around the world, especially in Europe where there has been a constant and significant increase in human trafficking and child prostitution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483991">I want to live in a country where our daughters are not treated like objects to be bought and sold. Legalizing prostitution means that all women can be prostituted. Contrary to what one may think, prostitution is not a women's issue. It is a problem initiated by men, a system of exploitation that, unfortunately, has been set up by men and for men who go to prostitutes. As someone who takes the lead in most debates, it is interesting to see that women are taking the lead on this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483992">Here is a fairly interesting example that shows the true face of this fight. A female MP in France is fighting to criminalize the purchase of sexual services, as is currently the case in Sweden and Norway. France therefore wants to go after the men purchasing these services, who are often referred to as clients. They are not clients. They are people who support prostitution and who go to prostitutes. They are just as responsible for this system as pimps. Believe what you will, but after this fight began in France, hundreds of men signed a petition in which they claimed the right to purchase sexual services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483993">The petition was titled “hands off my whore” and the petitioners included writers, actors, a lawyer, a journalist and many others. This showed the real face of prostitution in France.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483994">Grégoire Théry, a member of France's high council for gender equality, has said that johns are not poor, sexually deprived men. They are well-connected men of power who will not stand for the government prohibiting them from exchanging money for sexual acts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483995">I know that we have to have this debate in this chamber. I am therefore asking all the women in the House, who make up about 20% of MPs, to stand up and refuse to legalize this form of violence that we call prostitution. We need to have this political courage for our children, our sisters and our daughters. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3483996">I also invite all of my male colleagues to support the female representatives in the House when the time comes to consider this issue. I am asking them to do so for their daughters and their wives, but particularly for their sons so that they can grow up in a country and a society where human beings are not for sale.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3483999">That being said, I must admit that I am a bit disappointed because my colleague spoke almost exclusively about prostitution. Human trafficking is not limited to sexual exploitation. It also includes forced labour. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484000">I know that to be true because in my riding, unfortunately, there are many cases of forced labour among domestic workers and seasonal workers. The hon. member did not say much about that. That muddies things a bit. One of the things that human trafficking experts tell me when I talk to them is that the definition is not well known.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3484003">Indeed, trafficking takes many forms, and forced labour is a much more significant aspect of it in some countries. In Canada, 80% to 90% of all human trafficking is for the purpose of sexual exploitation. This is why I am placing so much emphasis on this. This is currently the most significant phenomenon in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484004">I agree that a small part of this exploitation occurs in the context of domestic work, for example, and the bill covers all kinds of human trafficking. All forms of human trafficking are abominable, but it is essential not to lose sight of a very important aspect of human trafficking worldwide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484005">Fully 80% of human trafficking in the world is done for sexual exploitation. It is important to understand that prostitution is linked to trafficking. We cannot separate the two issues and say that we have prostitution on one side and human trafficking on the other. That is not true. That would be burying our heads in the sand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484006">Prostitution and human trafficking are intertwined. All countries that legalized prostitution have seen human trafficking grow exponentially. We should be wary of this trap. We should not talk about prostitution as if it were an issue separate from human trafficking. That is a trap.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3484010">Canada needs to address the issue of purchasing sexual services. Sweden has done it and Norway has followed suit. They started with a basic principle: prostitution is a form of violence and the women, men and children trapped in the system are victims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484011">They created a law called “Women's Integrity”. What a great name. They invested resources in it and they worked to make their society understand that purchasing any form of prostitution—through a massage parlour, a strip club, or escort service—contributes to human trafficking and the exploitation of women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484012">They have created an egalitarian society where no human being may buy another. I dream of the day when we have a law here in Canada that makes it a crime to purchase sexual services and decriminalizes those victimized by prostitution by giving them safe havens and resources to get out of the trade, not to keep them in it. I dream of that day. I know that Canada is a great country that can take that vision and bring it to North America.</ParaText>

This is an important bill that would address a pressing issue. Human trafficking involves continuous violations of fundamental human rights whose protection forms the basis of our free and democratic society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484014">I would like to start by thanking the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="170253" Type="2">Ahuntsic</Affiliation> for bringing this pressing issue to the attention of the House again. As she knows, this is a very important issue for our government. Her previous bill, former Bill <Document DbId="4879493" Type="4">C-612, an Act to amend the Criminal Code (trafficking in persons)</Document>, which proposed similar amendments, died on the order paper in 2011.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484015">Before I turn to the proposals in the bill itself, I would like to make some general comments on the nature of human trafficking and its severe impacts on its victims, to underscore the importance of ensuring the strongest possible criminal justice response to this crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484016">Traffickers force victims to provide labour or sexual services in circumstances where they believe their safety or the safety of someone known to them will be threatened if they fail to provide that labour or service. They are deprived of the very rights that underpin a free and democratic society. The reality is that victims suffer physical, sexual and emotional abuse, including threats of violence or actual harm to their loved ones. This abuse is compounded by their living and working conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484017">To further aggravate the problem, this type of criminal conduct is not something that just happens occasionally or on the margins of society. Rather it is widespread, as evidenced by the global revenues garnered by it, which are estimated to amount to as much as $10 billion U.S. per year. This puts human trafficking within the three top money makers for organized crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484018">What are we doing about it? I am pleased to report that the government's response to this crime is strong and multi-faceted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484019">First, we have a virtual arsenal of criminal offences that apply to this reprehensible conduct. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484020">In 2003, trafficking specific offences were added to the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484021"> In 2010, a new offence of child trafficking was enacted through Bill <Document DbId="4328299" Type="4">C-268, an Act to amend the Criminal Code (minimum sentence for offences involving trafficking of persons under the age of eighteen years)</Document>, which was sponsored by myself, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170217" Type="2">Kildonan—St. Paul</Affiliation>. This offence imposes mandatory minimum penalties on those who traffic persons under the age of 18.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484022">In 2012, former Bill <Document DbId="5137989" Type="4">C-310, an Act to amend the Criminal Code (trafficking in persons)</Document>, sponsored by myself, the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="170217" Type="2">Kildonan—St. Paul</Affiliation>, extended extra territorial jurisdiction for all Criminal Code trafficking offences and enacted an interpretive tool to assist the courts in interpreting the trafficking in persons provisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484023">All of this is in addition to the trafficking specific offence contained in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, section 118, which prohibits transnational trafficking and the numerous Criminal Code offences that address traffic related conduct, such as forceable confinement, kidnapping, sexual assault and uttering threats, to give a few examples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484024">However, that is not all. In recognition of the multi-faceted nature of this problem, the government launched a national action plan to combat human trafficking on June 6, 2012. The action plan recognizes that a comprehensive response to human trafficking must involve efforts to ensure what we refer to as the 4 Ps: the protection of victims; the prosecution of offenders; the partnerships with key players; and, of course, the prevention of the crime, in the first place. All activities are coordinated through the human trafficking task force, which is led by Public Safety Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484025">This is, without a doubt, a comprehensive response to a complex problem, but more can always be done and where more can be done, more should be done, especially, when efforts serve to address a crime as insidious as human trafficking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484026">Bill <Document DbId="6254142" Type="4">C-452</Document> proposes a number of reforms that would strengthen the response I have just described. It seeks to impose consecutive sentences for trafficking offences and any offence arising out of the same event or series of events.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484027">The bill would also create a presumption that would assist prosecutors in proving the main human trafficking offence and it would require a sentencing court to order the forfeiture of an offender's property, unless he or she proved that the property was not proceeds of crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484028">Although some amendments would be required to address specific legal concerns, Bill <Document DbId="6254142" Type="4">C-452</Document> would undoubtedly strengthen the response to human trafficking and, as such, merits our support.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3484029">Legal concerns would have to be addressed. For example, the bill should not overlap with amendments that have already been enacted by the previous bill, such as the former Bill <Document DbId="5137989" Type="4">C-310</Document>, as this would cause confusion in the law. The bill should also avoid compromising the government's efforts to defend the living on the avails offence, paragraph 212(1)(j), along with other prostitution-related Criminal Code offences whose constitutionality is now before the Supreme Court of Canada in the Bedford case. The procuring provision, which Bill <Document DbId="6254142" Type="4">C-452</Document> proposals would affect, contains the living on the avails offence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484030">However, these concerns and others should not detract from the positive contributions the bill would make if it were enacted. The legal concerns I have outlined can easily be addressed through amendments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484031">We must continue to be vigilant. We must continue to support legislative initiatives that would improve our ability to hold accountable those who exploit the vulnerabilities of others. The impact of human trafficking on its victims is almost impossible to comprehend. We cannot tolerate it. We must ensure that those who engage in such heinous conduct are brought to justice, that their punishment appropriately reflects their crime and that they are not permitted to reap the rewards gleaned from the suffering of others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484032">Toward that end, I ask all members in the House to join me in supporting Bill <Document DbId="6254142" Type="4">C-452</Document>. I look forward to examining and analyzing its proposals more deeply in the context of committee review. At that stage, amendments can be moved to ensure that the bill achieves its laudable objectives without creating any confusion or inconsistency in the law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484033">I am sure that we all agree that we can never do enough to combat human trafficking. I am grateful that Bill <Document DbId="6254142" Type="4">C-452</Document> has provided us with yet another opportunity to do more. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3484035">Mr. Speaker, it is with pride and conviction that I, too, support Bill <Document DbId="6254142" Type="4">C-452</Document> sponsored by the member for <Affiliation DbId="170253" Type="2">Ahuntsic</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484036">Human trafficking is an issue that I am really passionate about. I have had the opportunity to talk with groups such as CATHII, the International Bureau for Children's Rights, World Vision Canada, Half the Sky Québec and Walk With Me Canada, and also with experts such as Professor Yvon Dandurand, Professor Jill Hanley and Detective Sergeant Dominic Monchamp of the Montreal police force.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484037">I have also listened to evidence from many experts and victims at meetings of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, and when I travelled to Thailand with World Vision Canada two years ago. As a result of these experiences, I am truly horrified by this serious situation, and I believe that it is urgent that we move quickly to make progress in this area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484038">For that reason, I support Bill <Document DbId="6254142" Type="4">C-452</Document>, which would amend the Criminal Code in order to provide better protection for victims of trafficking by setting out a legal definition of exploitation and including consecutive sentences for offences related to procuring and trafficking in persons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484039">To start with, we must take some time to explain what we are really talking about when we use the words “trafficking” and “exploitation”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484040">Trafficking in and exploitation of persons is an odious crime that can take several forms. The most common are forcible confinement; forced movement from one country to another, one province to another or one city to another; and forced labour and prostitution, when a profit is made by the person exploiting these victims. What all these crimes have in common is the fact that they are degrading, violate human dignity, and are characterized by incredible abuse, which can be physical, verbal or psychological.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484041">The main victims are women and children, who represent 80% of persons affected by human trafficking, as indicated by a 2005 International Labour Organization study. The most vulnerable are the usual victims of this scourge, and it is our duty to do everything we can to protect them. We must not forget that almost 50% of victims are minors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484042">Sexual exploitation is the most common form of human exploitation. Once again, women and children are the main victims. In fact, 98% of the victims of sexual exploitation are women. Over half of them are minors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484043">Canada is not immune to the scourge of human trafficking. We have a real problem of human trafficking and exploitation right here in this country, and yet very few people realize the scope of the problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484044">I know because, about a year ago, I showed the film <I>Avenue Zéro</I> in my office. I received many calls and emails from people who said that they had no idea that this was happening in their own backyards. Part of my riding, an area of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, is unfortunately known for human trafficking and prostitution. However, the general population is completely unaware of this problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484045">As for human trafficking across international borders, the most recent official figures from the RCMP date back to 2005, which is quite a while ago. Perhaps more statistics are needed. In fact, the RCMP estimates that every year, about 800 individuals enter Canada illegally as a result of human trafficking, and about 1,500 to 2,000 are trafficked from Canada to the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484046">As for human trafficking within Canada, we do not currently have sufficiently clear and reliable statistics to establish exact figures. The studies done in Canada on human trafficking and exploitation often overlook the issue of trafficking in Canadian citizens and residents within the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484047">It is possible, however, to assess the scope of this phenomenon and paint a picture of the people affected by human trafficking and exploitation in Canada based on studies done by international organizations and on the ample testimony of victims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484048">In 2009, for instance, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime led a study that found that 80% of the victims of human trafficking are trafficked for the purpose of prostitution. This observation also applies in Canada. Those most affected are women who enter Canada illegally through human trafficking, but Canadian citizens are also affected, including a significant proportion of young women from aboriginal communities. As we know, exploitation is often the result of extreme economic insecurity and a lack of knowledge of individual rights.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="40">(1840)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3484049">Like these hundreds of people who enter Canada each year to flee deplorable living conditions in their country of origin, a growing number of Canadians are faced with poverty and limited access to education. Every year, poverty pushes young girls from disadvantaged communities and aboriginal peoples to move to urban centres and leave their families behind. They are easy prey, for pimps in particular who force them to sell their bodies no matter how old they are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484050">The figures provided by Criminal Intelligence Service Canada on this are clear: the average age of entry into prostitution in our country is 14. As my colleague mentioned, if the age of entry into prostitution is 14, that means there are clients requesting 14-year-old girls, which is absolutely disgusting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484051">In light of the gravity of the facts and the extent of the tragedy, I think it is necessary to act as quickly as possible. We must remain focused because solving the problem of trafficking and exploitation requires a comprehensive strategy, including reducing the economic inequalities in our country and fighting the organized crime that is at the root of human trafficking worldwide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484052">Nevertheless, I know that Bill <Document DbId="6254142" Type="4">C-452</Document> introduced by my colleague, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170253" Type="2">Ahuntsic</Affiliation>, is a first step in the right direction. Her bill considerably improves the legal avenues we have for fighting exploitation and it sends a clear message to human trafficking abusers and victims: we will not allow the current situation to go on much longer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484053">I support the legal approach taken by Bill <Document DbId="6254142" Type="4">C-452</Document>. The bill's proposed changes to sections 279.01 and 462.27 of the Criminal Code are essential for giving our police officers and our lawyers the means for effectively fighting human exploitation and trafficking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484054">First, the new section 279.01 would give the justice system the necessary tools for identifying cases of exploitation, through a complete list of circumstances that are deemed to constitute exploitation. That said, Bill <Document DbId="6254142" Type="4">C-452</Document> provides a clearer and more precise definition of exploitation to ensure better victim protection. The changes made to section 462.27 of the Criminal Code, which seek to introduce offences of procuring and human trafficking, will enable more effective police action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484055"> Bill <Document DbId="6254142" Type="4">C-452</Document> would give the police and our justice system the means to work together to successfully combat human trafficking and exploitation. I had the opportunity to listen to Inspector Gordon Perrier, from the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Winnipeg Police Service, when he testified before the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights in April. He said the following: “Combatting exploitation requires a broad range of commitments on many fronts, and all the practices police and our partners employ come together when the laws are comprehensive”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484056">I am absolutely convinced that, in addition to being a significant legal breakthrough in the fight against human trafficking, Bill <Document DbId="6254142" Type="4">C-452</Document> also holds great symbolic value. Indeed, it sends a strong signal to victims of human trafficking—to women, especially aboriginal women. There is an opportunity here to refocus the law on victim protection by providing for denunciatory and consecutive sentences, which the accused must serve consecutively to any other sentence handed down by a judge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484057">Indeed, making the perpetrators spend more time in prison gives their victims enough time to begin their healing process, with greater peace. In doing this, we show our commitment to uphold human dignity. When we fight human trafficking we are fighting against the commodification of women and children, who are now being imported and exported, sold and resold. We are also fighting against the commodification of men who are forced to work, and against the sexual exploitation of the weakest and poorest by unscrupulous individuals and organized crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484058">To conclude, I would like to take the time to talk about human trafficking for forced labour, which we might call “slavery”. In my riding, I know that there are both domestic and seasonal workers who come to Canada and are forced to work. This is not sexual exploitation; although it was mentioned that sexual exploitation accounts for 80% to 90% of cases, there are all kinds of trafficking, which Bill <Document DbId="6254142" Type="4">C-452</Document> is designed to reduce as much as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484059">I also think that we will soon need to talk about prevention, because when some young women arrive in cities and urban areas, they often fall into prostitution at the age of 14, through no fault of their own. We should therefore start working on prevention with these young women.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3484060">Mr. Speaker, I rise to address Bill <Document DbId="6254142" Type="4">C-452</Document>, as have my predecessors this evening, which seeks to combat human trafficking and exploitation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484061">As I have said previously in debate on the bill, the true measure of a society's commitment to equality and human dignity is the protection it affords its most vulnerable members, and the victims of human trafficking are among the most vulnerable of all. It is therefore to the credit of this House that efforts to deal with this compelling concern have been initiated and supported by hon. members on all sides.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484062">I was proud to introduce Canada's original human trafficking legislation, as minister of justice, in 2005, and I am pleased to acknowledge the subsequent and ongoing special contributions of the member for <Affiliation DbId="170217" Type="2">Kildonan—St. Paul</Affiliation>, who spoke this evening.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3484063">Of course, I would like to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="170253" Type="2">Ahuntsic</Affiliation> for introducing the bill that we are looking at today. I intend to support it.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3484064">The bill before us seeks to bolster efforts to combat human trafficking and exploitation in three important ways.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484065">First, by adding these offences of trafficking to those for which the forfeiture of the proceeds of crime applies, the bill seeks to ensure thereby that traffickers do not profit from their actions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484066"> At committee, several witnesses testified that the average annual profit from trafficking one woman is $280,000. Moreover, according to the 2012 U.S. State Department report, the international trade in human beings generates approximately $32 billion each year. It is the fastest growing criminal industry in the world.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3484067">Éliane Legault-Roy, from the Concertation des luttes contre l'exploitation sexuelle, testified that this industry “responds solely to profit and customer demand”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484068">I completely agree that the government must be able to seize the proceeds amassed by those who treat human beings as goods to be sold.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3484069">Second, the bill aims to facilitate the prosecution of human trafficking offences by reversing the onus of proof such that an individual habitually in the company of a person who is exploited would be presumed complicit in the exploitation, absent evidence to the contrary. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484070">The justice committee heard from several witnesses that victims in such cases are reluctant to testify in court due to fear of facing their abusers and to the trauma of having to talk openly about their ordeal. It is therefore important to minimize the demands placed on victims in human trafficking trials to prevent their re-victimization, as this provision seeks to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484071">At the same time, it is generally a fundamental principle of our justice system that the burden is on the state to prove that the accused is guilty, rather than requiring the accused to prove his or her innocence. The member for <Affiliation DbId="170253" Type="2">Ahuntsic</Affiliation> has correctly noted that reversals of the burden of proof do exist in our Criminal Code, but they are rare, and for good reason. Accordingly, reverse onus provisions must be implemented with the utmost caution so as to minimize the risk of wrongful conviction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484072">As such, the Liberal member on the justice committee proposed amendments that would have specified that the reverse onus in Bill <Document DbId="6254142" Type="4">C-452</Document> would apply only to those who live off the avails of exploitation and are over the age of 18. This change would have preserved the bill's intent of lessening the burden on victims at trial while reducing the chances that this reverse onus provision might, in exceptional circumstances, entrap an innocent person. I regret that these amendments were unsuccessful, although, as I say, I will support the bill nonetheless.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484073">Finally, Bill <Document DbId="6254142" Type="4">C-452</Document> aims to deter the expansion of human trafficking operations by requiring offenders to serve their sentences consecutively, such that each additional victim represents an additional penalty to the offender. Many witnesses at the justice committee expressed frustration that concurrent sentences are currently the norm in human trafficking cases. For example, Robert Hooper, of Walk With me Canada Victims Services, told the committee:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484074">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...when you are able to garner upwards of $200,000 to $300,000 per trafficked victim in one year, and the only real risk in sentencing is a concurrent sentence for each additional victim, the trafficker is almost compelled to expand his business empire with little risk of significant ramifications to him in the criminal justice system here in Canada.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484075">I share the goal of making consecutive sentences the norm for human trafficking convictions. At the same time, I am reluctant to remove discretion from judges, as the bill does, by making consecutive sentences mandatory in all such cases. It is certainly possible to make consecutive sentences the norm while still allowing judges to order concurrent sentences in exceptional cases, providing they give reasons for departing from the usual practice. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484076">This is precisely what a Liberal amendment proposed at committee would have done, and I regret that it, too, was unsuccessful. As with the amendment to which I earlier referred, this one would have preserved the bill's raison d'être while ensuring that our justice system remains well equipped to deal with unusual and unforseeable circumstances. Still, once again, I share the objectives of this legislation and believe that its effects would be generally positive, and I will, as I mentioned, vote in favour of it.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="50">(1850)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3484077">I will now turn to a matter of process that arose at committee and that warrants our attention. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484078">The justice committee began clause-by-clause consideration of Bill <Document DbId="6254142" Type="4">C-452</Document> on May 6. At that meeting, the bill's sponsor, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170253" Type="2">Ahuntsic</Affiliation>, was present and permitted to speak by the chair. This was both appropriate and helpful for committee members and for all parliamentarians, who benefited from hearing the perspective of the member who proposed the legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484079">However, at the end of the meeting the Conservative members chastised the chair for having let the member for Ahuntsic participate. When clause-by-clause study resumed on May 8, at which time additional amendments were considered and a clause that had previously carried was reviewed and deleted, Conservative committee members refused to allow the member for Ahuntsic to take part in debate on her own bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484080">The member for <Affiliation DbId="170467" Type="2">York West</Affiliation> moved to let her speak. The government still rejected the motion. In the words of the committee chair, “...for a private member's bill I think every member has the right to come and talk to the bill and the amendments to it. ... I think that's only fair....” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484081">I agree fully, and I find it deeply regrettable that Conservative members denied the member for Ahuntsic the opportunity to address significant changes proposed to her own legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484082">As we know, in most cases the sponsor of a private member's bill can substitute for a colleague from the same party and so participate in committee discussion. However, when the bill is that of an independent member, as happened in this case, that option is not available to them. It is therefore, as the chair said, only fair to invite them as an additional and important voice. The Conservatives' refusal to do so was prejudicial to the principle of open and informed debate, essential to our legislative process. Moreover, the silencing of the member for Ahuntsic constituted a missed opportunity to act in a collegial manner on important legislation that enjoys all-party support. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484083">I would hope that hon. members would take pains to act collegially even when we disagree. How much more so should we seize opportunities such as this to join together in mutual respect and common cause? </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3484084">In that same spirit, I would like to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="170253" Type="2">Ahuntsic</Affiliation> for introducing this bill.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3484093">Mr. Speaker, I rise today in the House to follow up on a question I asked the <Affiliation DbId="194618" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation>. The <Affiliation DbId="194828" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the Environment</Affiliation> responded to me a few weeks ago about in situ oil sands projects and federal environmental assessments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484094">In my question, I said that the Conservatives had dismantled the laws governing Canada's environmental assessment process. However, that was not enough to please their buddies in the industry. Now they are going even further to exempt in situ oil sands projects from any federal review, even though this kind of oil sands project is becoming more and more common, which is, in itself, a contradiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484095">How do the Conservatives justify this decision, which does not seem informed and even seems dangerous? My hon. colleague, the <Affiliation DbId="194828" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the Environment</Affiliation>, compared the in situ oil sands projects to blueberry washing facilities. I do not know where that idea came from.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484096">The in situ oil sands projects are nothing like a blueberry washing facility. The level of danger is not the same. If polluted water is spilled, the problem will not be the same. I did not understand and I do not think I ever will understand how my hon. colleague could keep a straight face while comparing the oil sands to blueberries. He would have to explain it to me because I do not get it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484097">According to the Conservatives, environmental assessment is costly and results in delays. On the contrary, good environmental assessments save money in the long term and result in fewer delays as there is less to go on the defensive about in the event of legal action. The Conservatives must learn that the environment and the economy cannot be separated. They are inextricably linked. They strengthen society and make effective environmental assessments possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484098">As they say, prevention is better than a cure. We must not wait for the damage to be done; we must prevent it. Unfortunately, this exemption for in situ oil sands projects does not do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484099">The Conservative government is ignoring extensive discharging of materials harmful to the environment caused primarily by the oil sands industry. Millions of litres of toxic water are dumped with disastrous environmental consequences. This is due to the Canadian government's lax approach, which is based on a weak environmental assessment process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484100">Canadians are worried about the government's laissez-faire attitude towards environmental protection. They are worried about the potential impact on global warming. We should remember that the government recently went to Warsaw, where it embarrassed itself once again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484101">I would like to know why the Canadian government and the <Affiliation DbId="194828" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> believe that it is a good idea to exempt in situ oil sands projects. I hope that they will not use the blueberry comparison again, as it is a ridiculous response.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="194828" Type="18">Mr. Colin Carrie (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the Environment, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3484102">Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170228" Type="2">Drummond</Affiliation> for the opportunity to elaborate on his question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484103">Our government is committed to environmental protection and sustainable development. In fact, it is this Conservative government that has been strengthening environmental laws, setting higher safety standards and has been committed to enshrining the polluter pay system into law. That being said, I appreciate the opportunity to inform the member opposite of a few facts pertaining to the federal environmental assessment process that he may not have been aware of prior to asking his question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484104">First, it is important for the member opposite to understand that in situ oil stands were never on the project list, so there has been no change there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484105">Second, this project list has been expanded to include projects that were not on it before. Therefore, in this regard, we have actually strengthened our environmental assessment process. Let me be clear. There has been absolutely no dismantling of the laws governing federal environmental assessment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484106"> Quite to the contrary, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 strengthens environmental protection and brings the federal regime into the 21st century. This legislation brought in enforceable environmental assessment decision statements to ensure proponents comply with required mitigation measures to protect the environment. Federal inspectors now have the authority to examine whether or not conditions of a decision statement are being met. There are penalties for non-compliance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484107">After this legislation was passed, the Minister of the Environment talked to Canadians about its implementation. Comments were sought on whether amendments should be made to the regulations that identify which projects may require a federal environmental assessment. A variety of interests provided their views, and those views were given very careful consideration. Changes to the regulations have been made to ensure they reflect those major projects that have the greatest potential for significant adverse environmental effects in areas of federal jurisdiction. This will increase certainty and predictability for project proponents and for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484108">Let me again reiterate for my colleague opposite there has been no decision to exempt in situ oil sands projects from any federal review. In situ oil sands projects are not covered in the environmental assessment regulations that came into force through the amendments. They were not covered in the regulations before the amendments, and they were not covered in regulations under the former legislation. To make things perfectly clear for the member opposite, in situ oil sands projects have never been subject to federal environmental assessments, and federal permitting and approvals processes related to in situ projects have not changed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484109">Federal environmental assessment will continue to be implemented in a manner that supports responsible resource development to the benefit of all Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3484110">Mr. Speaker, I am a little angry. My honourable colleague, the parliamentary secretary, should not say that I do not know what I am talking about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484111">I was a member of the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development and I studied the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. I can assure him that the list is new. The Conservatives are the ones who made that change and they are the ones who established a list that does not include in situ oil sands projects. They are the ones who excluded them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484112">There never used to be a list. Instead, there were triggers. When there was a trigger, we considered the in situ oil sands project. My colleague should not try to mislead me because I studied this issue for two years as a member of the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development. He should not say that I do not know what I am talking about because it makes me a little angry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484113">I do not intend to get angry at him because he is usually quite nice to me. However, he should not tell me that I am not familiar with this issue when I am quite knowledgeable on the subject. Before, when there was a trigger, we examined the in situ oil sands project. Now, the Conservatives have excluded those projects from the list, which is a very serious and dangerous thing. That is why we are speaking out about this and that is why I am saying that it is absolutely essential that in situ oil sands projects be included in the list or that we go back to using the trigger process that is set out in the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484114">We also need to let people share their views with regard to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. Right now, environmental groups basically no longer have the right to express their views on these projects.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3484115">Mr. Speaker, if the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 had not been passed, we would continue to have a regime that requires environmental assessments of inconsequential projects with little potential for adverse impacts. That is what we talked about before in the answer with the blueberries. We would continue to have a regime without enforcement provisions. We would continue to have a regime lacking in predictable legislative timelines for the completion of an environmental assessment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484116">With the recent changes, environmental assessments will be focused on major projects that have a greater potential for significant adverse environmental effects. Federal resources will not be wasted considering assessments for an overly broad pool of projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3484117"> Effective and timely environmental assessment is important for both Canada's environment and its economy. Our government's actions ensure federal environmental assessment is focused on the right projects.</ParaText>
