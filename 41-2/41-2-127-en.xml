Third reading</ProceduralText><ParaText id="3848382"> moved that Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13, An Act to amend the Criminal Code, the Canada Evidence Act, the Competition Act and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act</Document>, be read the third time and passed. </ParaText>
						</Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Goguen" id="8469566"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170868" Type="18">Mr. Robert Goguen (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3848383">Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to participate in the third reading debate on Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document>, the protecting Canadians from online crime act. </ParaText><ParaText id="3848384">Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document> has received wide media attention, and almost every Canadian who has heard about it has had an opinion on it. Unfortunately, much of what has been reported in the media has disregarded the spirit of this legislation, and this has hampered an informed debate on this important piece of legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848385">Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document>, in simple terms, would do three very important things that would help make the world safer for Canadians. </ParaText><ParaText id="3848386">First, it proposes to amend the Criminal Code to create new offences for the non-consensual distribution of intimate images, or what some refer to as “revenge porn”. Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document> would also update existing offences, such as the harassing telephone call provision, to make them relevant in the Internet age. Some of these amendments would be particularly useful for police in relation to cyberbullying cases.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848387">The second important component of Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document> is the proposed enhancement of the investigative toolkit police use to deal with cybercrimes and electronic evidence. These amendments, which comprise the modernization of existing investigative powers as well as the creation of new production orders for specific information, would provide Canadian police with the tools that many other police in other countries have been using for over 10 years. The modernization of the toolkit would ensure that police could access the information they need, and only the information they need, to advance an investigation into an offence. </ParaText><ParaText id="3848388">By providing police with these modern tools, Parliament would not only be facilitating the investigation of crimes involving electronic evidence in Canada but would be enhancing privacy protection for Canadians generally by requiring the appropriate level of judicial scrutiny for all information in relation to which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="05">(1005)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3848389">Finally, Bill C-13 will allow Canada to access and provide greater international cooperation in criminal matters. This is of vital importance because so much evidence in relation to cybercrimes, such as that related to cyberbullying and the non-consensual distribution of intimate images, is stored and located outside of Canada. In many cases, where there is no international cooperation, no investigation can proceed.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3848390">As was previously pointed out at the report stage, Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document> was thoroughly reviewed by the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. The review involved 10 committee meetings and appearances by over 40 witnesses. While there were appearances by witnesses who opposed aspects of the bill, primarily the investigative tools, many of the witnesses were supportive of the entire legislation package. However, it should be noted that the new intimate images offence received almost universal support, including from members of the opposition.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848391">During his testimony before the justice committee, the <Affiliation DbId="194629" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> explained that the proposed non-consensual distribution of intimate images offence would prohibit the sharing of sexual or nude images without the consent of the person depicted. It is most important to respond in this manner to cyberbullying that involves this activity, which can cruelly humiliate and shame its target and cause irreparable emotional and psychological harm to the victim, particularly Canadian youth. The minister explained how this would remedy a gap in the criminal law. </ParaText><ParaText id="3848392">The minister also noted that Bill<Document DbId="6301394" Type="3"> C-13</Document> reflects recommendations made in June 2013 in a federal-provincial-territorial report on cyberbullying and the non-consensual distribution of intimate images, which recommended both the creation of a new offence and updates to the existing offences and investigative tools. The report was unanimously supported by the federal, provincial and territorial ministers responsible for justice and public safety.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848393">The committee also heard from a number of victims of cyberbullying and parents of deceased victims of cyberbullying, many of whom have become advocates for change to better address cyberbullying. Many of these witnesses expressed support for the proposals in Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document>. Mr. Glen Canning, the father of Rehtaeh Parsons, expressed concern about the challenge faced by police in trying to respond to modern crimes using antiquated tools. He also believes that had Bill C-13 been law at the time of his daughter's harassment, it would have made a positive difference. </ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3848394">The Committee also heard from police, including the president of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, the CACP, and the chief of the Vancouver Police Department, Jim Chu.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848395">The CACP represents over 90% of the Canadian police community, including federal, first nations, provincial, regional and municipal agencies.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3848396">Chief Chu clearly stated that the CACP fully supports Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document>. He offered the committee compelling testimony on the challenges of crime in the online environment and on its growth in areas of traditional crime, such as harassment, fraud, and kidnapping, as well as in relation to new crimes more closely linked to technological advances. He also explained to the committee the challenges police face because of the international nature of cyberactivity.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848397">Chief Chu articulated how technology can facilitate traditional bullying and make it more persuasive and painful. He also expressed concern about the lack of a safe haven and the difficulty of erasing anything from the online environment once it has been distributed. He said rapid intervention is needed before things get worse for victims, who may suffer consequences of this behaviour for the rest of their lives. He explained to the committee that the modernized tools in Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document> are essential for this response.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848398">Chief Chu explained that the bill does not create authority for police to obtain information without judicial warrant and that the police support Bill C-13's proposed judicial oversight as a good way to balance investigative needs and privacy protection. He also noted, however, that these tools need to allow police to respond quickly, which is essential in the online environment. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848399">He also responded to the inaccurate portrayals of Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document>, in some instances, as creating authority for police to wiretap without authority. Bill C-13 does not provide police with this power, and they will continue to require prior authorization by the courts to intercept any private communications. Nothing in Bill C-13 changes this. </ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3848400">The committee also heard from Greg Gilhooly, a lawyer who was a victim of an Internet predator when he was in his youth. </ParaText><ParaText id="3848401">Mr. Gilhooly expressed his strong support for the proposals in Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document> and provided the committee with personal insight into the urgency and importance of acting precipitously to enhance the law in this area because, as he put it, “there are monsters among us,” and police need tools to enable them to act and protect Canadians.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3848402">The committee also heard from Mr. David Butt, legal counsel for the Kids' Internet Safety Alliance and a front-line criminal lawyer who commended the government for striking the right balance between investigative needs and privacy protections with the proposals in Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848403">I would like to share with members this quote from his testimony to the committee:</ParaText><ParaText id="3848404"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...let's have vibrant police powers to investigate digitally, coupled with significant judicial oversight to control those police powers independently. That's the sweet spot that I say this bill hits. That's my measure of success in a bill: does it enable the police to act effectively, but does it also give another branch of government, the judiciary, the appropriate tools to oversee? If you've got both of those, you've got the right mix, and I say you've got the right mix here. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3848405">While other witnesses expressed similar views to the committee, I found this a particularly eloquent statement of what Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document> accomplishes.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848406">I would like to continue by citing the support for Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document> expressed by the Canadian Centre for Child Protection. Lianna McDonald, the executive director of this organization, appeared before the committee and explained that her organization is a registered charity providing national programs and services related to the personal safety of all children.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848407">Ms. McDonald explained at the committee that her goal in appearing was to provide both insight and support for Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document>. After over 30 years of working for child protection, she considered the bill to be something that would address the challenges her organization is very familiar with as first-hand witnesses to what she described as the collision between sexual exploitation, technology, and bullying. She explained to the committee that Cybertip.ca, Canada's national tip line for reporting the online sexual exploitation of children, has received more than 100,000 reports of sexual abuse and exploitation of children, which has resulted in more than 500 arrests and in removing numerous children from abusive environments. </ParaText><ParaText id="3848408">Ms. McDonald expressed concern that technology has become a powerful weapon and tool in the hands of those who wish to hide their criminal behaviour behind a cloak of anonymity, making it easier to engage in reprehensible harassment behaviour. She urged the committee not to fail in understanding the role of technology in the commission of offences and to be conscious of the importance of modernizing the law. She also expressed concern that the privacy rights of victims have been neglected in the focus on privacy issue discussions, and she indicated that Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document> would be fully supported by her organization. Ms. McDonald also expressed support for having the new offence of the non-consensual distribution of images apply to victims of all ages, as the impact of this behaviour is significant regardless of age.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848409">I hope that I have succeeded in conveying the reality of the broader witness testimony, which is that while there were some dissenting voices, many informed and engaged witnesses considered the proposals in Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document> as necessary and advisable. Unfortunately, media coverage focused primarily on those who expressed criticisms of the bill. Some of those criticisms demonstrated a lack of understanding of the proposals.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848410">Another aspect of the proposals that has not reached much attention but that may be of interest to note, given the prevalence of online crime, is the amendments to the Competition Act proposed in Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document>. </ParaText><ParaText id="3848411">We know that there are complex forms of white collar crime, and sometimes there are businesses that push the envelope too far and break the law. </ParaText><ParaText id="3848412">The Competition Act is a federal law governing most business conduct in Canada. The Competition Bureau, headed by the Commissioner of Competition, is an independent law enforcement agency responsible for the administration and enforcement of the act. The Competition Act includes both criminal and civil provisions aimed at preventing anti-competitive practices and other harmful conduct in the marketplace. It is designed to ensure that Canadian businesses and consumers prosper in a competitive, innovative marketplace. In particular, the Competition Act sets out certain criminal offences, including, among other things, price fixing, bid rigging, deceptive telemarketing, pyramid selling, and false or misleading representations that are knowingly made recklessly. It also includes civil provisions that deal with false or misleading representations and deceptive marketing practices, mergers, abuse of dominance, agreements between competitors, price maintenance, exclusive dealing, tied selling, and market restriction.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848413">Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document> would amend certain definitions found within the Competition Act to ensure that they are clear and technology neutral and that they align with those in the Criminal Code, the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act, and Canada's anti-spam legislation. This bill would also incorporate in the Competition Act, by reference, the new powers in the Criminal Code regarding preservation demands, preservation orders, and production orders for historical transmission data so that they could be used in investigations of all conduct under the Competition Act, both criminal and civil. As is the case throughout the bill, preservation and production orders sought by the bureau would be subject to judicial oversight.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848414"> In closing, I strongly support Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document>, and I encourage all members to vote in support of this important piece of legislation and to send it for further consideration to that other place.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Borg" id="8469573"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170229" Type="2">Ms. Charmaine Borg (Terrebonne—Blainville, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3848415">Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to the <Affiliation DbId="170868" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice</Affiliation>'s speech. I am concerned about two of his comments.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3848416">He said that the bill is enhancing “privacy protection”. He also said, “Nothing in Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document> changes this”.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3848417">I am very surprised because there is a specific clause in the bill that would grant legal immunity to any Internet service providers that choose to share their clients' personal information when asked by any government agency.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848418">What the government is doing is quite separate from the judicial oversight system and the process for obtaining warrants. I am very curious to know how the member can think that does not violate privacy protection.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Goguen" id="8469575"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170868" Type="18">Mr. Robert Goguen</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3848419">Mr. Speaker, the bill contains an immunity clause pertaining to the submission of documents. As I mentioned in my speech, one of the witnesses who appeared before the committee was Mr. Gilhooly. He is a corporate lawyer who used to work for Global. Mr. Gilhooly was a victim of Graham James, I believe, and he had the courage to come testify.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848420">In his testimony, he said, as a corporate lawyer, that the immunity would allay any doubt corporate lawyers might have about what is already enshrined in law. There is already immunity. Immunity was granted on a statutory basis, which confirms the state of law, before this was done. Nothing has changed. </ParaText><ParaText id="3848421">Mr. Gilhooly said that the immunity set out in the bill would remove any doubts corporate lawyers might have so that they could immediately hand the information over to police. That would allow the police to preserve the evidence. In such situations, the evidence disappears very quickly. Once it has disappeared, an investigation is impossible and it also becomes impossible to protect the victims, who are mostly young children.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It is an issue Canadians are concerned about no matter what region of the country we look at.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848423">Given the level of interest and the amount of potential legislative changes opposition parties have brought forward, such as my colleague from Vancouver who represents the Liberal Party, why does the member believe that the government has not really responded? Given the high level of interest in this issue, a keen sense of co-operation among all political parties to do more on the issue, why does he feel that the government has not acted on private members' initiatives that would have gone a long way in addressing some of the concerns he talked about in his speech. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

There were 10 meetings.

I am very concerned when I see what can happen to children all across Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848426">What worries me even more about Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document> is that we were unable to reach an agreement with the Conservative government to divide the bill.

I think that is appalling.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848447">I would also like to talk about the vote at second reading. There was a vote at report stage and another one on this part of the bill, and it was revised in committee. That said, I must denounce the fact that the Liberal Party voted in favour of the bill, even though it had criticized the bill repeatedly. It boggles my mind. I am not normally a member of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, but I was there when this bill was being studied.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848448">When they were asking the parliamentary secretary questions, some members said that the bill's first aim was to address bullying. On that issue, at least, we agree 100% with the Conservatives. All members on all sides of the House agree that cyberbullying must be stopped, for it is a very serious issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848449">New technology has completely changed the problem of bullying. In the past, once you were home, nasty people at school could no longer bother you, since you were in a safe place. These days, new technology and social networks allow bullies to follow us everywhere.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848450">If someone does not like what you wore to school, it will be shared on Facebook or in an email. Disturbing images can also follow us. Unfortunately, that is what happened in a couple of highly publicized cases, such as the Amanda Todd case. No matter what she did, that image followed her. I agree completely that this must be stopped.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848451">That is why we asked that the bill be split. That way, we could pass the essential elements and make positive changes to combat cyberbullying and non-consensual distribution of images. It is too bad that the government did not have the good sense to get this part passed quickly. We agreed to do so. This part of the bill could have been at the other place by now. Unfortunately, the government did not want to go ahead. </ParaText><ParaText id="3848452">It is a real shame because cyberbullying is a very important issue to me. I would like to use my 20 minutes to talk about only the parts of the bill that have to do with cyberbullying. Unfortunately, I cannot because we also have to talk about the problematic parts of this bill that could have very serious consequences for Canadians' privacy.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848453">Victims of cyberbullying deserve better. The families of cyberbullying victims came to committee to share their stories. They were very courageous. Nonetheless, there are thousands of other cases that are not in the media, unfortunately or fortunately, I am not sure which. These victims deserve a debate on this issue alone. Unfortunately, we must debate both because this government is incapable of co-operating.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848454"> Some of my constituents are working very hard to combat cyberbullying. Someone even developed a website to create a safer social network where people cannot be anonymous. It is very interesting.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="30">(1030)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3848455">I want to point out all the daily efforts these people are making. Some are forming groups to combat cyberbullying. These are truly exceptional Canadians, and I want to thank them. </ParaText><ParaText id="3848456">We have to talk about the other aspects because, unfortunately, very few pages and clauses of this bill really have anything to do with cyberbullying. The vast majority are on changes to the Criminal Code. Some parts of the bill are just fine, but others will seriously jeopardize Canadians' privacy. </ParaText><ParaText id="3848457">The government keeps talking about the judicial oversight system for obtaining warrants to get personal information. Indeed, some parts of the bill call for a warrant. I will talk about the problems with warrants later.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848458">However, what the government did not say in its speech and what it seems to have completely forgotten about is that a parallel system is being created, and that it completely bypasses all the mechanisms for obtaining warrants. That was part of the government's own bill. We are completely setting aside judicial oversight, which is the basis for our legal systems. We are creating a parallel system where someone can pick up the phone, call an Internet service provider and make an urgent request, and the service provider will send the information. The Liberals created this loophole in the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act and the Conservative government is taking advantage of it. </ParaText><ParaText id="3848459">We know that there have been abuses. The acting information and privacy commissioner announced that in one year, government agencies made at least 1.2 million requests for information from Internet providers. That is huge. I have trouble believing that there are 1.2 million terrorists, for example, or 1.2 million criminals running around in the streets and that we need to obtain information about them.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848460">Furthermore, it was the Internet service providers that informed us about the 1.2 million requests, not the government, which has shown an appalling lack of transparency. It does not want to give us that information. </ParaText><ParaText id="3848461">Also, there was no explanation as to why these requests were made. There is no oversight system for these types of requests that could guarantee to Canadians that they were made in extraordinary cases. I believe that Canadians are prepared to accept extraordinary cases. There are urgent situations where we cannot turn to the regular processes and where we must obtain a warrant after the fact. However, in light of the 1.2 million requests, I find it hard to believe that Canadians would not think that there had been abuses and that there is a flaw somewhere.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848462">I actually asked the government a question on the order paper about how many times it requested this kind of information from Internet service providers. That was just for one year, 2012-13. The Canada Border Services Agency said that it had made over 13,000 requests in one year. I asked the agency what kinds of cases or situations would result in such requests being made. Only two of the 13,000 requests were made for national security reasons. Can we honestly say that these are exceptional cases or national security cases? I think not. The question was asked, but the answer did not cut it.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848463">I asked the government another question because it was not going to share that information. I asked how many times government agencies had made such requests for 2001, which is when the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, PIPEDA, was passed. Here is something very disturbing: they did not have the data. We were told that there was no system to keep track of those kinds of requests and that the information could not be provided.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848464"><B>An hon. member: </B>For crying out loud.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848465"><B>Ms. Charmaine Borg</B>: For crying out loud. The member behind me said that because it is true. For crying out loud. They would have us believe that they can use this back door to ask Internet service providers for personal information, such as a person's IP address, but that they cannot track this stuff.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="35">(1035)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3848466">The government is saying that it cannot go back to determine, for example, how many requests were made and how many of those cases had to do with cyberbullying, child exploitation, national security or anti-terrorism. It claims that it does not have that data. How are we supposed to make sure that this is not being abused? Exploiting loopholes has become the norm, and that poses tremendous problems.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848467">This bill grants legal immunity to Internet service providers that choose to share their clients' personal information when requested to do so by any government agency or on their own initiative. However, most of the time, it is government agencies that make a request.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848468">A parallel system ensured that an Internet service provider that shared data it had no right sharing could be sued if it abused the process. That is the one and only aspect that gave people any sense of security.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848469">In certain cases, Internet service providers refused to respond to a request because they did not want to take the risk of being sued. Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document> takes away this one thing that made Internet service providers think twice. That is a major problem.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848470">When the Conservative and Liberal members—since they voted together—say they want to ensure that there is balance and a warrant system, that is false, for they seem to be forgetting that they gave Internet service providers legal immunity in this bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848471">Furthermore, the IP address reveals a great deal of information about users, including their conversations and where they go. Contrary to what the Conservatives like to say, it is not the same information that can be found in the phone book.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848472">I talked a lot about the shortcomings created by PIPEDA. Rather than correcting the situation, the provisions in Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document> make matters worse. In addition to providing legal immunity, Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document> also reduces the threshold for intercepting communications—that is, the content of an email or text message—to reasonable suspicion.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848473">There already was a threshold for obtaining a warrant, which was good. We should respect existing thresholds for being able to access personal information or communications. However, that threshold has been reduced to “reasonable suspicion”, which opens the door to abuse.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848474">I would like to point out another very specific aspect of this bill. If government agencies can ask Internet service providers to hand over personal information, public servants will have access to that information with a simple phone call. Here is how “public officer” is defined in Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document>:</ParaText><ParaText id="3848475"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">“Public officer” means a public officer who is appointed or designated to administer or enforce a federal or provincial law and whose duties include the enforcement of this or any other Act of Parliament.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3848476">I can think of many positions that would be included in this definition, including mayors. There are good mayors and bad mayors. Can they all be trusted? Are there any provisions to prevent abuse? No. This just opens the door wider.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848477">When this bill was examined in committee, the NDP proposed 37 amendments, which were all rejected. We heard from a number of witnesses, and contrary to what the parliamentary secretary just said, the witnesses did not all agree.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848478">Here is what Carol Todd, Amanda Todd's mother, had to say:</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="40">(1040)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3848479"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">I do not want my privacy invaded. I do not want young people's privacy compromised. I do not want personal information being exploited without a protection order that would support individuals. I do not want any Canadian hurt in my daughter's name. I want her legacy to continue to promote hope, celebrate our differences, and give strength to other young people everywhere.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3848480">I think she would have been pleased to see us split this bill. She does not want anyone's privacy to be invaded, or the threshold for obtaining communications to be lowered, or for government agencies to be given access to personal information without a warrant. That is what she wants for her daughter's legacy. It is really quite clear.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848481">There is another aspect that the committee was unable to assess because it happened after review in committee and that is the Supreme Court ruling in Spencer. It is an extremely important ruling that brought certainty to something that may have been rather vague before. In Spencer, the Supreme Court ruled that no one could have access to clients' names, addresses, telephone numbers and IP addresses without a warrant. Nonetheless, in Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document> we just included statutory immunity for Internet service providers who share information without a warrant.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848482">There is some serious and legitimate uncertainty as to whether these parts of the bill are constitutional and whether they will be blocked.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848483">That being said, why could we not have sat down together and sorted this out? We know that the Conservative government seems to be short on respect for the Constitution and the Supreme Court's rulings, as we saw during the process for appointing a new justice to the Supreme Court. It is the government's responsibility to ensure that every bill, every law it wants to enforce respects the Canadian Constitution. It is the government's fundamental duty. When the Conservatives say that there was a review, that legal experts assessed the bill to ensure it was consistent with the Constitution, that is great, but the Spencer ruling was handed down after the bill was drafted.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848484">I am puzzled by something else. As we know, the government is refusing to respond to this decision. It claims that everything is in order and that the bill is constitutional even though many experts doubt that it will pass the test of the Constitution in light of the Spencer ruling. What is interesting is that we expected the government to respond, but it was actually the Internet service providers that did so. Now Rogers and TELUS will no longer respond to requests for information about their clients made by government agencies. Why is the government not taking its responsibilities seriously by declining to make these requests? That would be the responsible thing for the government to do. Instead, it is the other side doing this. That really bothers me.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848485">I agree completely that we must amend the law. It must keep pace with new technologies and the new problems that society faces. Many new things are happening, and we have to keep up to date. However, we cannot and should not put the protection of people ahead of the protection of privacy. We can find a balance. No matter what the Conservative MPs would like to think, this is not a balanced bill. Furthermore, there is a high probability that it is unconstitutional. It is therefore very problematic.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848486">The government says that it is opening the door, that it is all right in certain situations. Yes, there are exceptional cases. However, I am afraid that the government is violating privacy and that once it opens the door, it will open it wider. Where will that take our society?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Third reading</ProceduralText><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Stanton" id="8469953"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="195000" Type="93">The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bruce Stanton)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3848828">When the House last took up debate on the question, the hon. member for Malpeque had seventeen and a half minutes remaining in the time for his remarks.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Easter" id="8469954"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170158" Type="2">Hon. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3848830">Mr. Speaker, I recognize that I have about seventeen minutes left. I expect I will not use that, just to warn the next speaker who may be on the list, as I have spoken to this bill before.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848831">Before question period, I was outlining that I was pleased but also troubled to speak to Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document>. I outlined that the Liberal Party is very supportive of the cyberbullying aspects of the bill, but troubled over the parts that are measures in the old Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> on lawful access, which so many Canadians spoke out against. </ParaText><ParaText id="3848832">Efforts were made, and I am disappointed that the government did not accept those efforts by both opposition parties, to split the bill. It was not only the opposition members who wanted to split the bill; it was the new Privacy Commissioner and many others, including Carol Todd, who knows very well about the difficult and troubling aspect of cyberbullying. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848833">The bill was not split. However, regardless, we do feel within the Liberal Party that cyberbullying is such a scourge on society that we are going to have to put not only a little water in our wine, but a fair bit, in fact, because we are very seriously troubled over aspects of the bill. This tends to be what the current government does. The Conservatives will put a couple of good points in the bill and add a whole lot of other material that should not be in that particular bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848834">The Liberals believe that a balance must be struck between civil liberties and public safety, particularly when it comes to warrants that may be intrusive and overboard. We do not support the measures that were in Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>, which the government had to withdraw because of Canadians' outrage. The problem is that some of those points are back in this bill. Some of this bill duplicates the rejected Bill C-30, such as word-for-word reproductions of the changes to subsection 487(c.1) of the Criminal Code; and all but one-word changes to subsection 492.1 and section 492 regarding warrants.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848835">We are very concerned about efforts to reintroduce “lawful access”, which the Conservatives promised was dead.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848836">Though the title is the “protecting Canadians from online crime act”, nobody would be protected under this act. In typical government fashion, this is all about punishment rather than prevention. Complex problems like cyberbullying require more than blunt additions to the Criminal Code. This omnibus bill touches everything from terrorism to telemarketing, and cable stealing to hate speech. It is an affront to both democracy and the legislative process in the way it was handled.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848837"> If it had been split, what could have been a bill on cyberbullying, which probably would have had the unanimous support of the House, is no longer possible. What is seen from us is reluctant support because we have to, regardless of the consequences, deal with the cyberbullying side. That is certainly why I am troubled.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848838">I want to turn to a couple of quotes that outline the extent of the problem in terms of the way that the government has dealt with this bill. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="15">(1215)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3848839">There was an editorial in <I>The Globe and Mail</I>, on November 22, entitled “Not Without a Warrant”, from which I will quote:</ParaText><ParaText id="3848840"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Under current law, a wiretapping authorization will only be issued by a judge if police can show a “reasonable ground to believe that an offence has been or will be committed.” But under Bill C-13, <I>wireless</I> wiretaps can be authorized on the looser standards of “reasonable ground to suspect.”</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3848841">The editorial goes on:</ParaText><ParaText id="3848842"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Why not make police applications for a <I>wireless</I> wiretap clear the same, high legal hurdle as a traditional wiretap? And why is the government burying all of this inside an unrelated piece of legislation covering the highly emotional topic of cyberbullying? Parliament should be debating and voting on each measure separately, on its merits. Once again, the Conservative government is engaging in unnecessary legislative acrobatics. Time to cease and desist.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3848843">I will read one more. This is an editorial, also on November 22, from the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I>, entitled “More than 'cyberbullying'”. I will just read a piece of it:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848844"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">If the government wants to make cable theft a criminal offence, or increase police powers to track online communication, it is perfectly within its rights to propose those things. There is no reason to bundle it in with a bill that has an entirely different purpose. The announcement about the bill calls it “legislation to crack down on cyberbullying.” This suggests the Conservatives never learned the main lesson from the Toews' debacle, and are still trying to bundle and brand their legislation instead of simply defending it on its merits.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3848845">We are certainly not the only ones who are troubled about how the government approaches these bills, rams stuff through committee, and fails to give proper legitimate debate to each item on its own merits, so that at the end of the day this place can be proud, on all sides, of what we have passed.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848846">However, as I said, the cyberbullying issue is of such an urgency that we cannot deep-six, if I could put it that way, that aspect of the bill that we do not like. We are forced to vote on a bill that we are troubled over, and, reluctantly, we will.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848847">However, we will put a red flag on all areas infringing upon privacy that we are concerned about, and hopefully in a future Parliament we will see democracy break out in this place, where committees can do their job, as the founders of this country envisioned it would be done.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848848">Let me close by saying that on the cyberbullying aspect, the Criminal Code is not the only instrument that needs to be embellished, if I could put it that way, in order to deal with the problem of cyberbullying. We believe that these legislative measures alone are insufficient to combat cyberbullying, and we urge the government to commit to a broader, more holistic strategy to deal with cyberbullying. </ParaText><ParaText id="3848849">It would also include public awareness resources for parents and kids. In other words, there has to be an education campaign, a publicity campaign, whether it is police forces, or community leaders, or whatever, who go into our school system to talk about the problem of cyberbullying and how this new technological world that we live in can haunt us, and, in fact, is used to haunt certain individuals in society.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848850">In order to save time, I will close my remarks. I appreciate having had the opportunity to speak at third reading of this bill.</ParaText>

They are always on their feet saying “Well, my golly, you voted against that and you voted against this.” What foolishness.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848857">In what happens at committee and in this place, there are always certain aspects that members may or may not like. Just because a member votes against a particular piece of legislation does not mean they dislike the whole of it.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848858">The strategy of the government is such that their members and others can get up and say, “Oh, my goodness; you voted against that”, trying to use it politically.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848859">Political business takes place during election times. Between elections, we should be doing good debate in here and respecting each other, instead of getting that kind of malarkey from the government side all the time.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848860">Let me get to the member's point. </ParaText><ParaText id="3848861">There are measures that the government has undertaken in terms of other aspects of dealing with cyberbullying beyond the Criminal Code, but a lot more needs to be done. That is what I am expressing in terms of this bill.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848862">I would say to the member in conclusion that if the government had split the bill, as we asked it to do, then I think there would have been great support in this place on the cyberbullying side. The government could have then said that all parties supported what it was doing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848863">However, the strategy of the government is that it really does not want the opposition parties to support it.

I do not know.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848872">In any event, no, this is not the only bill. In fact, most of the government's bills are that way. The budget bill was a particular example. In it there were endless pieces of legislation that had no relation to the budget. </ParaText><ParaText id="3848873">I expect we are going to see that the next budget has copyright in it. The real strategy of the government is to find a TV clip of someone to use as an attack ad. That is why it is going to be in the next budget bill. It is not going to be debated in its own right; it is likely going to be thrown into the budget bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848874">The government is always up to those kinds of tricks. This is a government that believes in creating division and in wedge politics, and that is kind of sad to see in this country, because it is importing the kind of debate that we see south of the border, which is really divisive and often unproductive.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848875">I know it would take a lot, but I would encourage the government to come to its senses and put legislation forward on the specifics of what the bill is supposed to deal with.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

If Liberals are reluctant, then they should know that they should not be supporting this bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848877">The member knows full well that there was a court decision on language similar to what is in this bill. The court decision was made in light of the Spencer case, in which the Supreme Court of Canada ruled, the day after the adoption of the bill by the Conservatives at committee, that Canadians have a right to be anonymous on the Internet and that police must obtain a warrant to uncover their identities. This bill would actually prevent that from occurring.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848878">The Liberals attempted to do something similar when they were in power. They tried to pass a bill that would have amended the Criminal Code to allow police services to carry out lawful access on their networks. </ParaText><ParaText id="3848879">My question to my colleague is this: why are Liberals supporting a bill that they say they are reluctantly supporting? Do they actually firmly believe that it is proper for people's privacy to be infringed on, as this law would do, knowing full well that the government continues to put bills forward that are very controversial in nature?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848880">The government knows that people are supportive of addressing and fixing the cyberbullying situation, but in the meantime it keeps putting in a poison pill by throwing the whole kitchen sink into the bill. The government knows Canadians will not be in favour of these other measures, but by making the opposition look like they are against a situation such as cyberbullying, which is not the truth, it can gain points.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Wayne Easter</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3848881">Mr. Speaker, I guess the simple answer to that question is that Liberals are hopeful that within a year's time we will be able to get rid of the people who are putting those poison pills in the bottle. In that way, there will not be poison pills in the future, and there will be a government in this place that would be able to correct some of the concerns that I know the member has, as we do.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848882">The fact of the matter is that those who are impacted by cyberbullying right now cannot wait a year. It is a difficult call, but it is a judgment call that we in the Liberal Party believe has to be made. We tried and fought hard to split the bill so that we could vote against those aspects, but we see the need for the cyberbullying part. It is a judgment call, and it is all about taking the right kind of leadership position. </ParaText><ParaText id="3848883">I can assure everyone that the Liberal Party is up for providing leadership to Canada and Canadians, and we are going to vote in support of the cyberbullying side.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Leef" id="8469987"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170598" Type="2">Mr. Ryan Leef (Yukon, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3848884">Mr. Speaker, before I begin I would like to confirm that I will be splitting my time with the <Affiliation DbId="194838" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Labour</Affiliation>.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848885">It is great to follow on the heels of the member for <Affiliation DbId="170158" Type="2">Malpeque</Affiliation>. We certainly appreciate his reluctant support, far more than we appreciate their responsible neutrality on other issues in this place. </ParaText><ParaText id="3848886">It is a great opportunity to stand and be part of a government that understands the needs and challenges of Canadians. That government gives us lowly backbenchers an opportunity to speak in the House, which I know the member for Malpeque also has a tremendous amount of disdain for.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848887">I am pleased to speak today about Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13, the protecting Canadians from online crime act</Document>, which proposes key amendments to the Criminal Code, the Competition Act, and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act in order to bring them up to date with 21st century technologies. </ParaText><ParaText id="3848888">The bill is both timely and vitally important. We so frequently remark that the world is getting smaller and smaller by the day that it is just a cliché. The barriers that distance used to create between people are becoming less and less relevant as technology advances.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848889">The advent of the Internet, e-mail, web addresses, and all this technology has meant that we can stay connected from almost anywhere in the world. These technologies have obviously brought about incredible opportunities for Canadians. It is increasingly possible for Canadians to conduct business easily and efficiently on a global scale. We can keep in touch with our loved ones while pursuing opportunities in distant lands. We can learn about the world we live in by using the vast resources available on the Internet today.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848890">It is not an understatement to say that these new technologies have changed the way we live. Unfortunately, some of them have also changed the way crimes are being committed and the kinds of evidence that are left behind. These technologies have made it possible to commit crimes that transcend geographical borders. Existing methods of investigating just will not work in this environment, and no country can conduct these kinds of cross-border investigations without co-operation from other countries.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848891">That is why Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document> is so important. It would provide police with the tools they need to investigate not only crimes committed here in Canada but also transnational crimes. Crucially, Bill C-13 would allow Canada to ratify the Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime. </ParaText><ParaText id="3848892">This convention is the only international treaty that is specifically designed to provide a standard set of legal tools to help in the investigation and prosecution of computer and Internet-based crime as well as more general crimes involving electronic devices. It would also assist parties to the convention by providing them with a mechanism for international co-operation. Canadian police will be able to access the Criminal Code's new investigative tools in appropriate cases and coordinate with other countries for transnational investigations.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848893">I would like to focus my remarks on the convention. </ParaText><ParaText id="3848894">The convention facilitates national and transnational investigations by requiring three principal things. It will require a minimum standard of offences, it will require a minimum standard of investigative tools, and it will require a point of contact in each country that is available 24 hours a day and seven days a week. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848895">The convention requires signatory states to adopt a minimum set of standard offences for computer-related crimes. For instance, the convention requires that countries criminalize certain illegal uses of computers, such as hacking. It also requires that all participating countries criminalize illegal interception, data interference, system interference, misuse of devices, and, of course, child pornography. These measures will help to reduce the overall incidence of computer crime by deterring the use of the states parties to the convention as safe havens for criminal purposes.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3848896">It is important to note that Canada already has a great set of offences to combat cybercrime. However, Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document> is designed to fill the gaps that remain, and I can assure members that those are very few. </ParaText><ParaText id="3848897">Ensuring that all state parties have laws that are similar would allow for better co-operation in the investigation and prosecution of crimes that have connections to multiple jurisdictions. To this end, the Convention on Cybercrime would assist to ensure that convention partners would have compatible cybercrime-related offences.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848898">However, the convention does not just deal with crimes themselves. The convention also deals with the investigation of crime. Computer crimes that transcend national boundaries often leave behind digital evidence in multiple locations. The nature of investigations is changing, both in technique and in scope. The convention would ensure that participating countries would have the tools they need to combat cybercrime at home, and equally important, that they would be able to assist each other in the investigation and prosecution of crime at a multi-jurisdictional level.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848899">For instance, participating nations would be required to adopt tools that would facilitate the tracing of communications and would be able to order the production of data related to the routing of telecommunications. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848900">The bill contains amendments that would provide for such things, including preservation orders and demands. These powers would require the computer data that would be vital to an investigation to be preserved from destruction so police would have the time to obtain the warrants or orders to obtain that data.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848901">Importantly, the convention requires participating nations to have readily identifiable contacts to increase communication and co-operation on investigations. Specifically, it requires that each country designate a point of contact that would be available 24/7 to give immediate assistance to those kinds of investigations.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848902">Knowing who to call in another country can make all the difference to an investigation involving electronic evidence where time is literally of the essence. For example, in the time it may take to identify the responsible foreign authority, information important to an investigation could be lost forever.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848903"> Becoming a real party to the convention on cybercrime is all about that. It is about ensuring that Canadian investigators have all the tools they need at their disposal to conduct efficient and effective investigations, both in Canada and in the context of investigations that reach beyond our borders. It is about ensuring that we are not in the fight against cybercrime alone. It is about taking responsibility for our role as a nation in transnational crime, supporting transnational investigation and benefiting from the assistance of our international partners in return.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848904">I hope all members will support this bill so Canada can join its partners in making the world a safer place.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848905">Finally, it should be noted that Canada is the only G7 country that has not has not yet ratified the Convention on Cybercrime. Further, all countries, including Canada, publicly endorsed the convention for its substantive and procedural framework. It is a model for international co-operation. All of Canada's main partners recognize the convention as a foundation on which international co-operation can be facilitated. Canada's ratification of the convention would extend the reach of Canadian law enforcement across the globe and enhance our ability to better protect Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848906">We need to do our part and encourage other countries to join us in rising to these important challenges. Ratification of the Convention on Cybercrime is a necessary step in that direction, and Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document> would enable that. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Unfortunately, in my riding we have had over four young people commit suicide, in part or in full due to cyberbullying because they were being tortured online, sometimes by adults, sometimes by peers within their own school community.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848915"> I had the opportunity to sit with the <Affiliation DbId="194614" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness</Affiliation> a couple of summers ago and with the parents of children who had committed suicide due to ongoing persecution online, many times by their peers.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848916"> We absolutely have to take hold of this issue.

In fact, reports and statistics are clear that the vast majority of bullying is going on over the Internet and with other forms of electronic tools. Unfortunately, the impact on our youth in our school system is the single greatest effect. It is affecting attendance rates, the health and well-being of our young people, and their self-esteem.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848919"> As the parliamentary secretary indicated, in some cases it leads to very sad and tragic consequences. That cannot be overlooked by any member of the House of Commons. The seriousness of this cannot be overlooked by any party. It is one component of this legislation, but I think we would all argue in this place that probably the most important part of it is the cyberbullying component. </ParaText><ParaText id="3848920">I am grateful the parliamentary secretary raised that point. We need to get this through the House to ensure we protect Canadian young people from these types of crimes.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mrs. McLeod" id="8470008"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="194838" Type="18">Mrs. Cathy McLeod (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Labour and for Western Economic Diversification, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3848921">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to join this important debate on a Friday before Thanksgiving. I would also like to wish everyone here a happy Thanksgiving and a productive constituency week.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848922">I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in support of Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document>, which is the protecting Canadians from online crime act. This bill would give enforcement officials the tools to conduct their investigations in a world that has moved from old fashioned telephone calls and snail mail to a constantly evolving telecommunications environment. </ParaText><ParaText id="3848923">I might date myself a bit, but I remember in the late 1980s, early 1990s, learning about the Internet. If we look at what has happened since then, we had giant computers and now most of us sit here with our smartphones and small iPads. There has been an amazing change in the world, and to be quite frank, our tools have not kept up with these enormous changes.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848924">Although the primary objective of Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document> is to ensure that the criminal justice system is able to keep pace with this new environment, as well as changing the nature of how criminals operate, the government has to be attentive to the privacy intrusive character of investigative techniques. This is what I will focus my remarks on today.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848925">The media, through some commentators, has characterized Bill C-13 as bad for the privacy of Canadians. To be quite frank, that is not accurate. Bill C-13 would enhance the privacy protections for Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848926"> While a police investigative tool, such as a search warrant or production order will naturally impact upon a person's privacy, all the amendments included in Bill C-13 have been very carefully crafted to balance the pressing need to provide police forces with the effective investigative tools they need in the current environment with the constitutional imperative to protect the rights of Canadians to a reasonable expectation of privacy. A good term for that is “privacy with precision”.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848927">The Criminal Code already contains several tools that allow police to obtain evidence of crimes. For example, there are judicial warrant provisions to allow police forces to collect evidence themselves in real time, such as through tracking of a person. There is also judicial production orders, which allow the police to ask a third party to produce certain types of historical data or documents, for example, a record of phone calls. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848928">These current tools were designed and implemented before the advent of much of the technology and social media that we rely on today, making them inefficient in today's world and too privacy invasive in some respects. Therefore, the approach we have taken with Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document> is aimed at ensuring that the privacy of Canadians is adequately protected, while meeting the investigative requirements by providing police appropriate investigative tools that have been judicially authorized for specific investigative needs.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848929">For example, C-13 would create new types of production orders to obtain specific information of a less personal nature, such as the path of a telecommunication, rather than relying on the current general production order, which allows access to all types of information, including those of a more personal nature, such as the content of the data that has been stored on a computer.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848930">Police officers today basically have access to only one means of compelling the production of documents and data in relationship to the electronic evidence, and that is the general production order. Whether they want to attain a library full of information on a suspect or one single piece of information, such as an email address, police officers must use the same judicial protection order. To put it another way, and I think it is more illustrative, we can think of a general production order as a large net that authorizes police to catch everything within reach of that net. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848931">I am going to use a bit of an analogy here, coming from a family that loves to fish. If we think of the police as the fisher, the fisher would use this net to catch everything the net came into contact with, such as mackerel, cod and salmon. It would be appropriate for the fisher to use the net if he or she was authorized to catch all those fish and the fisher wanted to catch all those fish. In the same way, when police want all data and documents a third party has on a suspect, it would be appropriate to use the net, in this case, what we term the general production order. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3848932">However, let us say the fisher is only authorized to catch a subsistence quantity of cod, so that he may be able to put food on the table for his family. If he were to use a net, the fisher runs the risk of not only catching the cod but also the mackerel and the salmon, which the fisher neither wants nor is he authorized to catch. For this purpose, the fisher should be using a more precise and more specific tool. A fishing line and a jigger is a good example. With the cod jigger, the fisher can catch his three or four fish and be on his way without fear of over-catching or taking fish that he does not want or need.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848933">In this vein, the new privacy with precision production orders in Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document> provide the police with tailored tools that grant access to specific and limited information. The specific judicial production orders are like the cod jigger, only capable of catching cod, for example.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848934"> In the context of production orders, a specific production order would only give police access to a limited range of information that does not have an elevated expectation of privacy, such as historical data related to the tracing of a communication or historical data related to the tracking of a transaction.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848935">The use of these specific tools provides police with the information they want and need to continue an investigation, while at the same ensuring that police are not over-obtaining the personal information of Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848936">These new tools under the reasonable suspicion standard have been crafted to reflect the leading decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada and mirror existing Criminal Code provisions, some of which date back to 1993. I mention this because these proposed new production orders have been criticized for introducing the reasonable suspicion standard to the Criminal Code.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848937">Let me be clear, this standard is not new. It has been employed in Canadian criminal law since 1993. On this point, I am going to go back to my net analogy one more time in relation to judicial scrutiny. One could characterize this as a resource issue for police, because for police the difference between meeting the judicial standard of reasonable belief and reasonable suspicion is the amount of time and proof they need to meet each standard. In this regard, we could say that meeting the standard of reasonable belief is more resource intensive than meeting the standard of reasonable suspicion.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848938">For the fisher, this would be the cost of his equipment or his tools. The fisher must decide whether he will spend $100 on a net or $5 for a line. While the net would give the fisher access to whatever is in the sea, the fisher may really only want a few cod for dinner. The net would be overkill and could catch things the fisher should not be catching. Again, the fisher, for this purpose, should be using the cod jigger.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848939">I apologize for the analogy, but I think if there are Canadians watching, sometimes those analogies do help make a little sense out of what can be some very complicated legal issues.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848940">Conversely, if the fisher is entitled to a commercial catch and authorized to catch a certain tonnage, he would probably prefer to use the net.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848941">For the police, it is more appropriate for them to provide more proof to the courts and to spend more time preparing the application when they need all the data and documents related to a suspect for which there is a high expectation. Conversely, it is also appropriate that they meet a lower level of judicial oversight when the information they want is limited and less privacy invasive.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848942">Before I conclude, I would like to emphasize that nothing in Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document> would permit the police to compel the production of any personal data without a judicially authorized warrant or order. There are absolutely no provisions in the bill that would authorize the warrantless access of private personal data.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848943">In addition to privacy with precision, the bill also includes other privacy enhancements. For example, Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document> proposes to increase the threshold for obtaining a tracking warrant in situations involving the tracking of an individual's movements. </ParaText><ParaText id="3848944">While reasonable suspicion would remain the test for obtaining a warrant to track the movement or location of things, the government strongly believes that tracking an individual's movements is a much more serious infringement on the right to a reasonable expectation of privacy. Hence, the legislation proposes to provide a more stringent test, which the police would have to meet before they could obtain a warrant to track an individual.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3848945">The Government of Canada is strongly committed to maintaining the rule of law through all of its legislation. It will continue to ensure that such authority will be exercised, bearing in mind the privacy interests and human rights protected in Canadian laws, such as the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Privacy Act, and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act. </ParaText><ParaText id="3848946">Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document>, protecting Canadians from online crime act, is a prime example of this commitment. Again, I would like to urge all members in this chamber to support Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document> and to see it put in place.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I want to thank my colleagues who, both in committee and in the House of Commons, have defended our New Democrat position in opposition to the bill, and have spoken of what we expected from our proposal to ensure that the bill is about putting a stop to cyberbullying, as it says it is.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848962">Unfortunately, what we have, once again, is the Conservative government using language—and in this case, I would also argue, using people who are in vulnerable situations—to put forward a regressive agenda that has everything to do with attacking people's privacy. It leaves tremendous loopholes in terms of powerful actors gaining access to private information, and that would do very little to put a stop to cyberbullying, which is a very serious and sometimes tragic problem in our society.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848963">We have heard from my colleagues as to why we do not support the bill. We put forward, I believe, 37 amendments at committee to improve the bill. We indicated that whether it is the private member's bill put forward by my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170347" Type="2">Chicoutimi—Le Fjord</Affiliation>, for an anti-bullying strategy, or the bill put forward by my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170644" Type="2">Dartmouth—Cole Harbour</Affiliation>, to deal with sexual images and exploitation online, there are ways we can try to put a stop to cyberbullying and to the way in which too many people are exploiting privacy, private images, and taking advantage of people, in many cases young women, online.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848964">What I find most disturbing about the debate and discussion around Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document> is the way in which the tragic stories of young women who took their own lives as a result of cyberbullying are being used by the current government to push its agenda.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848965">I do not know how many more ways we can say that this is wrong, that this is beyond disrespectful. It is disturbing, frankly.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848966">I have had the opportunity to meet with the mother of Amanda Todd, and I have met with other youth, including those involved in Jer's Vision, who have done a great deal to try to fight bullying and cyberbullying in our communities. These are people with ideas. Sometimes these are ideas that come from places of immense pain, of having lost a loved one or having themselves experienced suicidal thoughts to get away from bullying. Despite that, they are proposing ideas. They are finding ways in their communities, and they are calling upon leaders at all levels of government, particularly at the national level, to take steps that would have an impact on ending bullying.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848967">I am particularly encouraged by those who are applying a gender lens to this kind of bullying because we know it has a gender lens. There were the high-profile cases of young people who took their own lives as a result of cyberbullying, and they were women. In many of the cases, unfortunately, particularly in the mainstream media, women's experiences when it comes to the use of bullying was missed. Sexual objectification is very different and can lead to some very devastating situations.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848968">I also want to acknowledge the way in which LGBT youth, lesbian, gay, and trans youth, are often the targets of cyberbullying, which has a gendered lens as well. Yet nowhere in Bill C-13 is there any plan to act on, not just bullying, but the cyber-misogyny that we see running rampant online and in our society.</ParaText>

It is not a quick fix and it certainly is not Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document>. What it requires is real leadership and tackling the very serious issues of inequality, violence against women, sexual harassment, and the marginalization of girls and women in our society. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848971">It also means taking bold action when it comes to putting an end to the discrimination of trans people and the particular discrimination that trans women face, and recognizing that we have a role to play. Sadly, all I hear in the House is the way in which the Conservative government is using the stories of young women who experience cyber-misogyny to put forward its own agenda, which has nothing to do with that. The hypocrisy, and frankly, the disregard for these women's memories is, like I said, disturbing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848972">In taking the next steps, I would encourage the government to not only see the value of dropping this badly thought out bill, which stands to benefit some of the government's agenda with regard to pulling people's private information and having access to people's private lives in a way that it sees as helpful, I guess. However, there are other steps it ought to be taking. </ParaText><ParaText id="3848973">For one, it could support the motion that I put forward, a national action plan to end violence against women. It could work with this side of the House to try to find a way to build a comprehensive anti-bullying strategy, including working with community organizations and young leaders who are on the front lines and understand what it means to be a victim of cyberbullying.</ParaText>

Second reading</ProceduralText><ParaText id="3848992"> moved that Bill <Document DbId="6580267" Type="4">S-221, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (assaults against public transit operators)</Document>, be read the second time and referred to a committee. </ParaText><ParaText id="3848993"> He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join the debate today and to speak in strong support of Bill <Document DbId="6580267" Type="4">S-221</Document>, a bill that seeks to acknowledge, through explicit sentencing principles, the harm caused when public transit operators acting in the course of their duties experience violence.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848994">I urge all members to vote collaboratively to ensure that the bill is passed into law as quickly as possible. </ParaText><ParaText id="3848995">I would like to start by first thanking Senator Runciman for his diligent work on this file in the other place. I would also like to mention the work of the member for <Affiliation DbId="170192" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville</Affiliation> in this matter.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848996">Transit operators play an absolutely critical role in the lives of our citizens and our communities all over Canada. Nowhere is this more apparent than in our major cities, where public transit is relied upon to transport millions of passengers every day.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848997">It would be no exaggeration to say that without the people who drive our buses, trains, subways, trams, and taxis every day, our economy and our communities would be in peril.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3848998">A 2010 report prepared by the Canadian Urban Transit Association, entitled “The Economic Impact of Transit Investment: A National Survey”, offers the following key findings: transit reduces vehicle operating costs for Canadian households by approximately $5 billion annually, and it reduces vehicle accident costs by $2.4 billion annually.</ParaText><ParaText id="3848999">We need to ensure that the transit system operates effectively, that people feel safe when they use the transit system, and that those operating our public transit feel assured that if they are victimized on the job through acts of violence, the criminal justice system will effectively respond to such violence.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849000">At present, there is no specific offence or aggravating factor in the Criminal Code that uniquely targets acts of violence committed against public transit operators. The proposed bill would amend the Criminal Code to create a new aggravating factor for the sentencing of offenders convicted of uttering threats, any of the three assault offences, and unlawfully causing bodily harm to transit operators.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849001">This would send a strong message that Parliament believes that such crimes must be treated more seriously because of the fact that those victimized are vulnerable, given the role they occupy, and because of the potential for broader harm to passengers and the public.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3849002">The amendments align with the preventative purpose of criminal law. That is, the bill proposes a criminal law response that seeks to prevent harm from occurring in the first place by deterring the commission of such crimes through explicit sentencing principles. It further responds to acts of criminality that can have a significant effect not only on the individual victim but more broadly on the safety of the general public.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849003">These amendments would make Canada's criminal law approach to violence against public transit operators comparable to the approach taken in other jurisdictions, including a number of U.S. states and Australia's New South Wales. While the approach taken is not identical in all cases, these jurisdictions have all taken steps to explicitly address violence committed against transit operators.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849004">More serious incidents of violence toward transit workers are occurring across the country. Every day, transit operators face the real risk of being assaulted on the job. Their physical exposure and frequent customer interactions leave them vulnerable to being molested, struck, or spat on and to becoming the targets of verbal abuse, threats, and thrown objects.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849005">Transit operators, due to the nature of their work and their inherent inability to defend themselves against aggressive acts while carrying out their duties, face a number of unusual and unpredictable threats in their workplace that most Canadians do not.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3849006">Transit operators face most of the known risk factors for workplace violence: interacting directly with the public, working alone or in isolated areas, having a mobile workplace, working late at night or early in the morning, providing services to people who may be experiencing frustration, having a workplace where access is uncontrolled, handling monies or fares, and having inadequate escape routes. Relying on this, transit workers are at higher risk for violence than are workers in many other occupations.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849007">Members need not solely listen to me to understand why we are singling out public transit operators in this bill. Let us hear testimonials from people directly involved in this matter.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3849008">On June 12, 2014, the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs heard from Neil Dubord, the chief of the Metro Vancouver Transit Police. In his own words, he explained why public transit operators need to be granted additional protection by the law. He said:</ParaText><ParaText id="3849009"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Public transit is differentiated from other occupations by the very nature that they serve a broad spectrum of customers including the working poor, homeless, addicted and those suffering from mental illness. As with other occupations, the opportunity for operators to disengage and extricate themselves from potentially violent situations does not exist. They cannot walk away or withdraw from the incident because they are locked in the driver's seat and operating a large vehicle. A pilot would never allow a passenger to freely walk into the cockpit of a plane.... Public transit operators do not have the luxury of restricting access; their occupation is unique and the hazards they face are not experienced by other occupations. This is why they require the protection of Bill S-221.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3849010">Passing Bill <Document DbId="6580267" Type="4">S-221</Document> would provide Canadian public transit operators and taxi drivers with an extra legal safeguard to deter assaults committed against them.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849011">My riding of <Affiliation DbId="170558" Type="2">Pickering—Scarborough East</Affiliation> contains two separate municipalities and, in turn, two separate transit authorities, Durham Region Transit and the Toronto Transit Commission.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3849012">In the area serviced by Durham Region Transit, there were four relevant instances of assault on transit operators in 2013 alone. The TTC states that there is an assault on a public transit operator in their system at least once a day.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849013">For example, on July 20, 2011, a woman boarded a TTC bus and became involved in a fare dispute. She proceeded to hurl racial slurs at the TTC employee. The situation quickly escalated, and the woman pepper-sprayed not only the bus driver but three passengers who bravely came to the aid of the victim. Her penalty? Forty-six days of jail time for four charges of assault with a weapon.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849014">As horrible as such cases are, they pale in comparison to the ordeals that other public transit operators have had to endure across the nation. A bus driver in the Maritimes received 14 stab wounds to his face, neck, and arm. He lost over half of his blood and nearly died in the process, all because he would not deviate from his route. In Edmonton, a driver was hospitalized in intensive care after he was subjected to a vicious and unprovoked beating from a passenger. The list goes on and on, and tragically, it lengthens each and every day.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849015">These attacks not only take a personal toll on the victims but can also have a significant financial impact on the transit systems in terms of lost work hours, medical claims, employee absenteeism, and lawsuits.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3849016">According to the Canadian Urban Transit Association, there were 2,061 reported assaults in 2011. That is over five reported instances of assault a day across this country.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849017">StatsCan reports that the average public transit operator is more than four and a half times more likely to be assaulted while operating their vehicle than the average person walking on the street.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849018">Of course, the need for quick passage of the bill is not based merely on the fact that public transit operators are more likely to get assaulted; quick passage is also needed because of the consequences of the assault on the public in both the immediate and long term.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849019">Public vehicles are, by their very nature, transporting members from the public. An assault on a public transit operator can happen quite literally at any time, whether it is in a school zone, on a highway, in a side street, or parked at a station. The transit operator is tasked with an incredible amount of responsibility for the individuals that they are servicing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849020">Should an assault happen while an operator is driving their vehicle, we suddenly have not only the driver at risk of serious injury but every other person on the bus as well. In addition to the passengers, every single pedestrian, cyclist, and driver in the immediate vicinity also becomes a potential victim.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3849021">While being physically assaulted is of course horrendous, being witness to such a destructive act can have its own effect. Members of the general public using transit need to be reassured that their safety is protected at all times, and the best way to do that on our transit systems is to protect our operators. Every single Canadian should have a right to both be safe and feel safe at work. </ParaText><ParaText id="3849022">I appreciate the hard work that many associations and organizations such as the Canadian Urban Transit Authority and the Amalgamated Transit Union are doing in committing themselves to making sure that the workplace of public transit operators is as secure as possible.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3849023">In addition to shaking the confidence of the general public, assaults on public transit operators have a more direct effect on the industry, namely in the recruitment and retention of competent operators.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849024">Bill <Document DbId="6580267" Type="4">S-221</Document> is intended to serve as a deterrent to violent acts against public transit service operators and to increase overall safety on public transit. Having legislation like Bill <Document DbId="6580267" Type="4">S-221</Document> in place would give judges the grounds to hand down harsher sentences than if the victim were not a transit operator or a taxi driver.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849025">If I may, I would like to briefly touch on the reasoning behind including licensed taxi drivers in this bill. Much like the assault of a bus driver poses an immediate threat not only to the driver but to his passengers and the people around them, so too does the assault of a taxi cab driver. The similarities do not end there. Cabbies often find themselves working alone at late hours, dealing with fares, being restricted in their seats, having a mobile workplace, etcetera. That much is very straightforward. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3849026">The need to include taxi drivers is only emphasized when we look at the staggering rates of violence against this group of individuals. From 1997 to 2011, the homicide rate for taxi drivers was 3.2 per population of 100,000. In that 15-year period, 23 taxi drivers were murdered in cold blood. Unfortunately, we do not have official statistics on assaults on cab drivers, but one can only shudder when thinking about how high they must be.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849027">The very last point I would like to speak to concerns a recent court decision here in Ottawa. I feel that it perfectly illustrates the actual issue Bill <Document DbId="6580267" Type="4">S-221</Document> would address.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849028"> A man was charged and pleaded guilty to assaulting a bus driver. The crown requested that the judge consider the fact that the victim was a bus driver in rendering the sentence. When handing down his decision, the judge said:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3849029"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Does his status as a bus driver alter the severity of the sentence I am to impose? I do not believe the law supports the notion that bus driver assaults <I>per se</I> attract higher sentences than other assaults....</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3849030"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That bus drivers are exposed to the risk of assault is supported not only by periodic media reports of driver assaults but by common sense. Bus drivers encounter thousands of individuals during their work, many of them impaired or simply intent on mischief...</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3849031"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">While all of this is true, I am aware of no settled body of authority holding that an assault on a bus driver is<I> per se</I> more serious than assaults on anyone else who has the misfortune of being victimized, and no authority was advanced by the Crown. To be sure, the <I>Criminal Code of Canada</I> does contain principles aggravating the seriousness of an offence for vulnerable groups including those prone to hate-based abuse, the mental or physically disabled, children, and those who the offender owes a duty of trust to. Bus drivers are not, however, enumerated.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3849032">This is not the first time we have debated criminal law reform to address this reprehensible activity. There have been several private members' bills on the subject, from members from all political parties, but unfortunately, they were not passed.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3849033">Support for this bill extends far and wide. Transit unions, transit police, bus and taxi drivers, the Ottawa Transit Commission , the TTC, and many others have spoken in strong support of this bill. We now have the opportunity with Bill <Document DbId="6580267" Type="4">S-221</Document> to work together and unanimously pass into law meaningful changes that will appropriately address the violence committed against transit operators.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849034">We owe it to these hard-working men and women to ensure that the law properly responds to the harm they experience. Bill <Document DbId="6580267" Type="4">S-221</Document> would assist in this regard, and I strongly support the bill.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Bringing this bill forward in the House is laudable. </ParaText><ParaText id="3849036">The statistics he quoted are certainly sobering, such as that there are five attacks a day in this country against our transit officials. That is very worrisome, and it may very well be why the unions in 2010 asked the government to pass this sort of legislation. At the time, the minister of Justice refused, saying that this type of thing is already covered in the Criminal Code. I am glad to see that the government has finally come to its senses and has brought forward this legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849037">One thing I did not understand in his presentation was that the member said this bill would act to protect our transit authorities. That may be true directly, if we are talking about sending people for longer sentences. The bill would give the courts the possibility of imposing greater penalties. If we are talking about recidivists, those who continually attack transit authorities, I would feel safe because they would be behind bars. However, I did not hear anything in the member's speech that suggested that there was a high rate of recidivism.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849038">I would like to know exactly who would be protected here. How would they be protected? Would it not make more sense to also have provisions that would reduce violence on our streets?

We will be supporting this bill because it makes sense.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849041">The question I have for the member is this: a number of bills have been introduced on this topic, including one sponsored by the member for <Affiliation DbId="170651" Type="2">Burnaby—New Westminster</Affiliation>.

The bill would add subsection 269.01 to subsection 269 of the Criminal Code, which would state that when a court imposed a sentence for an offence referred to in any of sections 266 to 269, common assault, assault with a weapon, aggravated assault and assault causing bodily harm, it shall consider as an aggravating circumstance the fact that the victim of the offence was, at the time of the commission of the offence, a public transit operator engaged in the performance of his or her duty and shall give primary consideration to the objectives of the legislation and the tenets of the conduct that formed the basis of the offence. </ParaText><ParaText id="3849044">This bill concentrates on one of the sections of the Criminal Code that deals with aggravated assaults.

First, it amends the Criminal Code to consider as an aggravating circumstance the fact that the victim was, at the time of the commission of the offence, a public transit operator engaged in the performance of his or her duty. </ParaText><ParaText id="3849047">I am hardly a Canadian Criminal Code expert, unlike many of my colleagues on both sides of the House who can claim to be. I had no idea what an aggravating circumstance was, so I decided to do a little research to learn more about this.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849048">Here is what Jean-Paul Doucet wrote in <I>Dictionnaire de droit criminal</I>:</ParaText><ParaText id="3849049"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">An aggravating circumstance is a circumstance attending the commission of a crime or a characteristic of the offender or the victim of the crime. Aggravating circumstances make the crime more dangerous to society and therefore deserving of stronger sanctions. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3849050">Section 718.2 of the Criminal Code of Canada addresses sentencing and aggravating circumstances as follows:</ParaText><ParaText id="3849051"> <Quote><QuotePara Align="Left">A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3849052"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">(a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender... </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3849053">In this example, the various legislators ordinarily distinguish between the aggravating circumstances associated with the offence and those unique to each offender.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849054">There is a lot of good news in these definitions of aggravating circumstances. First of all, this addition to the Criminal Code ensures that the court dealing with the offences committed against public transit operators will take into account the fact that the victim was performing his or her duties at the time of the offence. This is a major win for the workers covered by this bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849055">To illustrate the extreme importance of this aspect, I will provide an example directly related to taxi drivers.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849056">In its 2009 report entitled “Homicide in Canada”, Statistics Canada shows that those most at risk of being killed on the job are police officers and taxi drivers. I will read an excerpt:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3849057"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left">On average, 13 victims have been killed each year since 1999 while "on the-job", including 11 in 2009. A recent report concludes that taxi drivers and police officers have the highest rates of homicide per 100,000 persons in their occupation. In 2009, there were three taxi drivers and one police officer killed as a direct result of their profession. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3849058">In Canada, 23 taxi drivers were murdered between 1997 and 2011. In Montreal, 68% of nighttime taxi drivers feel that their job is not very safe or not at all safe. That is not even to mention other public transit operators, who are also the target of violence during their shifts.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849059">Next, what I like about the definition of “aggravating circumstances” is that the court must take this new factor into consideration when ruling on an offence, but judges also have the freedom to decide how harsh a sentence to impose. As mentioned in the legislation, every case is different. It is up to our judges to rule on each case.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849060">It is very refreshing to see that people still have confidence in our justice system and that this addition to the Criminal Code does not involve a minimum sentence, which is something the Conservatives unfortunately often include.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3849061">I would like to point out another aspect of Bill <Document DbId="6580267" Type="4">S-221</Document>, which is the scope of the definition of “public transit operator”. I would like to quote clause 2 of the bill:</ParaText><ParaText id="3849062"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The following definitions apply in this section.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3849063"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">“public transit operator” means an individual who operates a vehicle used in the provision of passenger transportation services to the public, and includes an individual who operates a school bus.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3849064"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">“vehicle” includes a bus, paratransit vehicle, licensed taxi cab, train, subway, tram and ferry.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3849065">The bill covers several different types of jobs that all involve workers who deal directly with the public and who, in some circumstances, can become victims of crime during their work day.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849066">The New Democratic Party has always made it a priority to protect public transit operators. We support the demands made by the associations and unions that represent these operators. For years, they have been calling for better protection for their members.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3849067">Unfortunately, several times a year we hear stories about assaults on public transit operators in the media. For example, in April 2013, a thirtysomething bus driver with the Société de transport de Montréal was savagely beaten by three men on his bus while he was driving down Saint-Laurent Boulevard. In November of that same year, we heard of the sad story of Ziad Bouzid, a 45-year-old taxi driver and father of three from Montreal.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3849068">Mr. Bouzid, who had driven a taxi for more than a dozen years, was savagely shot to death in the middle of the night, during his shift. These assaults on these workers must stop. As parliamentarians, it is our duty to do everything we possibly can to help them and ensure that these kinds of things do not happen again. That is why the NDP already introduced a number of private members' bills that were similar to the bill we are studying today.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849069">However, I am disappointed to see how the Conservative government goes about addressing an issue as important as workers' safety.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849070">In 2010, the justice minister at the time, now the <Affiliation DbId="194632" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>, said that the Criminal Code already adequately protected transit operators from all forms of assault. However, the Amalgamated Transit Union had long been calling for a bill similar to the one before us today.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849071">The Conservatives have not done anything to resolve the problem since they came to power in 2006. Instead of helping workers, they have introduced bills that deny workers the rights they fought so hard to win.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3849072">This government has attacked the Labour Code many times. For example, I am thinking about how the definition of the word “danger” is going to be changed because of the Conservatives. This will have a negative impact on many workers, particularly those who have jobs on the front line, such as our correctional officers. It is shameful that the government is seeking to make women and men in uniform more vulnerable.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849073">Like the current government, the former Liberal government did not propose any measures to help public transit operators. It is time for that to change.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849074">This is an issue that is very important to me. For my generation, a job with a public transit company, such as the one in Laval or Montreal, is a promising career opportunity. I am thinking, for example, of my friend Nicolas, who started working for the Société de transport de Montréal a few years ago. He loves his job. He is a happy guy who loves working with people. He has a good, well-paid job with good working conditions. However, his safety can sometimes be compromised by individuals with bad intentions. Nicolas is a young father, and we would be very remiss if we, as parliamentarians, did not do everything we can to protect him better as he carries out his duties at the STM.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3849075">The taxi industry is flourishing in cities like Laval and Montreal, and making the work of taxi drivers safer is also very important to my constituents, especially those who live in Saint-François in Laval.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849076">Members may be surprised to learn that many taxi drivers work in Montreal but live in Saint-François, which is in my riding. Saint-François is a lively neighbourhood where more than forty cultural communities live in great harmony.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849077">If you pass by Marcel-Villeneuve Avenue in the morning, you will see taxis leaving Saint-François to take the Pie IX Bridge or Highway 25 to go to Montreal. The drivers will only return late at night after a long day. These men and women work very hard to give their children the best possible future.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849078">I also think of all the school bus drivers in Laval and across Canada. I am sure that they have to deal with all sorts of things over the year. They do an excellent job. I would like to thank them for safely driving our children every day. </ParaText><ParaText id="3849079">It is time for us to take action and I sincerely hope that this bill is passed as quickly as possible. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It cannot be pleasant to go to work if one is worried about being assaulted or even shouted at, as many of them are.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849083"> We understand that 2,061 bus drivers were assaulted in 2011, with attacks ranging from being spit on and punched in the head to knife attacks and sexual assaults. That is entirely unacceptable, and this bill would go some distance toward addressing that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3849084"> The nature of their work certainly puts bus drivers at heightened risk, so we have an opportunity as parliamentarians to reduce that danger to bus drivers and take action to protect them.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849085"> By making it explicit that assaulting a bus driver is a criminal offence with serious consequences, this should, although it would not in all cases, deter these crimes. I would suggest as well that there be some education and notice, whether on buses or in bus terminals, that this is an offence. Maybe it would give people second thought as to whether they would treat bus drivers in an unacceptable fashion.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849086">The Liberals support the bill in general. It is a private member's bill, but we have had discussions on it and there seems to be fairly widespread support in the House for Bill <Document DbId="6580267" Type="4">S-221</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849087"> I want to name a couple of my colleagues who have done fairly extensive work on addressing the difficulties that bus drivers face when they go to work everyday.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3849088">The member for <Affiliation DbId="170750" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> has spent a lot of time examining public transport in his city and holding discussions with drivers. He even did a ride along. It was truly an eye-opening experience to be with the bus driver and see what drivers faced over quite a number of hours. It is not like getting on the bus and getting off four or five stops down the road. The member for Winnipeg North certainly got a feel for what it was like to be in that workplace on a continuing basis. </ParaText><ParaText id="3849089">Then there is the Liberal long-term member for <Affiliation DbId="170466" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation>, who introduced Bill <Document DbId="6254118" Type="4">C-533</Document>. The bill would make the nature of a victim's employment as an on-duty transit operator an aggravating factor for sentencing purposes in relation to all Criminal Code offences. I will talk a bit more about the views of the member for Wascana on this matter. </ParaText><ParaText id="3849090">As well, there have been others who have introduced private members' bills related to this issue. There is Bill <Document DbId="6253824" Type="4">C-402</Document>, which comes an NDP member, and Bill C-637, which comes from an independent member.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3849091">Many members in this place are concerned about the issue and have put forward various proposals. </ParaText><ParaText id="3849092">As I said earlier, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170466" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation> put out a blog today. He wrote:</ParaText><ParaText id="3849093"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">With the support of transit employees, their unions, municipalities and other transit operators, police officers, the Canadian Urban Transit Association and others, I have spent the past year promoting legislation to better protect bus drivers and other transportation workers.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3849094">That bill was Bill <Document DbId="6254118" Type="4">C-533</Document>. Some aspects of that bill are related to and referenced in this piece of legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849095">As he stated in his article today: </ParaText><ParaText id="3849096"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">These people provide vital services to the general public in all sorts of locations in all weather conditions and at all hours of the day and night. They are often on duty alone, operating powerful vehicles on public streets and thoroughfares. By the nature of their employment, they assume serious responsibilities for public service and safety, and put themselves in a vulnerable position.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3849097">He went on to say: </ParaText><ParaText id="3849098">“Bill <Document DbId="6254118" Type="4">C-533</Document> had earned broad public support, but remains on the Order Paper of the House of Commons. Such Private Member's Business is selected for debate and a vote by the luck of a draw. Other MPs from all other Parties have also advanced similar proposals from time to time. This is not a partisan issue that divides along political lines”. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3849099"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">A few months ago, a Conservative Senator (Bob Runciman) brought forward his own proposed “bus driver” legislation (Bill S-221).</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3849100">That is the bill we are dealing with today.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849101"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">It differs in detail, but is similar to mine in principle.

As the member for Wascana pointed out:</ParaText><ParaText id="3849106"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">It applies only to certain specific offences in the Criminal Code, not every offence. And it doesn’t make any reference to persons coming to the aid of a bus driver under attack. On the positive side, it does include a useful definition of “transportation employee” that covers certain others like taxi drivers too.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3849107">From the outset, I do not believe many of us consider this legislation to be a partisan proposal or a partisan position. It is useful legislation and should be moved forward through this chamber quickly. </ParaText><ParaText id="3849108">The member for Wascana continued:</ParaText><ParaText id="3849109"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Once it becomes law, transit operators need to launch prominent communications campaigns,</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3849110">—as I said a moment ago—</ParaText><ParaText id="3849111"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">informing the public that offences against people like bus drivers are serious criminal matters carrying serious penalties. And offenders will be prosecuted.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3849112">To come back to where I began, bus driver assaults in any fashion, whether it is language, spitting, or actual assaults, are a serious matter. These people provide a public service. They deserve a safe and secure workplace, and the bill should show that Parliament supports them in their workplace in having a safe environment to work in.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849113">I am certainly pleased to support this legislation.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. O'Toole" id="8470174"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="194848" Type="18">Mr. Erin O'Toole (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of International Trade, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3849114">Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="6580267" Type="4">S-221</Document>, a bill that comes to us from the Senate, and to follow up on the remarks from my colleague, the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="170558" Type="2">Pickering—Scarborough East</Affiliation>, who introduced the subject to the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849115">This is a bill to create as an aggravating factor in sentencing, threats of harm or violence toward public transit workers who get assaulted or threatened in the course of their employment. This would bring in considerations for the court to consider when sentencing an offender who has assaulted or put into a situation of harm someone in the course of doing a job that is a public service. </ParaText><ParaText id="3849116">This would apply to five specific Criminal Code offences and the sentencing that comes out of convictions under those charges. The first would be uttering threats under section 264.1 of the Criminal Code; assault, section 266; assault with a weapon or causing bodily harm, section 267; aggravated assault, section 268; and unlawfully causing bodily harm, section 269. </ParaText><ParaText id="3849117">The maximum penalties in sentencing for these violations of the code range from five to 14 years when proceeding by way of indictment. At the sentencing level, it is clear there is discretion for the court in that range and some of the considerations should be brought to the court's attention when sentencing those offenders.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3849118">The aggravating factor would apply when the victim of one of the five Criminal Code offences I outlined was a public transit operator in the course of his or her duties, a duty that is a public service, from the B.C. ferries right through to buses in St. John's, Newfoundland. It is good public policy in that these are already Criminal Code provisions. These are harms our society agrees upon, and agrees that people should be responsible for their conduct and that there should be a penalty. The penalty should consider these aggravating factors in the fact that this is someone performing their duties. </ParaText><ParaText id="3849119">We should remember that transit workers, whether they be TTC in my area, or Durham Region Transit, cab drivers, and others, often work late shifts. In some cases they are 24-hour shifts. Rick, from Clarington Taxi, picked me up at 4:45 this morning, a time when there is potential for harm. </ParaText><ParaText id="3849120">In some areas of the country we have seen that harm inflicted. In fact, between 2005 and 2011, Winnipeg, a city I had the pleasure of living in while I was in the air force, saw a 300% increase in violence inflicted on their transit workers in that city in just those six years. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3849121">A cursory review of newspapers just in the last few years would show that this is a national problem. In 2013, there was a very high-profile closed circuit TV assault of a transit operator in Calgary, where the vicious assault could be seen. I think a paramedic was harmed in the same incident. Just this April, in Surrey, British Columbia, a driver was punched in the face when someone was trying to run off on a fare. In Toronto, there was a quite well-known incident at Yonge and Bloor where passengers had to come to the aid of the driver, who was being assaulted. </ParaText><ParaText id="3849122">This is a real issue that has unfortunately been on the rise at a time when we are encouraging people to take public transit. We have to support the men and women who are providing this service to make sure they can do so in a way that is professional and that provides the public good that transit provides. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3849123"> They know that we, as a government, are saying there should be a harsher sentence when there is violence perpetrated toward these people for no reason other than the fact that they are doing their job.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849124">Senator Runciman, I think, rightly expressed the need for this when he said:</ParaText><ParaText id="3849125"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">This is a bill that balances Parliament's right to provide direction to the courts in defined circumstances with judicial discretion at sentencing.</QuotePara></Quote>
							</ParaText><ParaText id="3849126">As a lawyer, I think it is important for us to talk about these sentencing decisions in a professional way. Courts will arrive at a just decision in terms of innocence or guilt of a crime, and at the sentencing stage, when they are addressing punishment for that crime, they will consider a number of factors—some aggravating factors, some mitigating factors—in determining what type of punishment our society will give, through the court, to the person who commits a crime.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849127">This should be very seriously considered when it is a crime that infringes upon the rights and the personal well-being of another Canadian, particularly someone who has been tasked with a public service role.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3849128">I would remind the members of this House that in the early debate, it is clear there is a lot of support for the bill coming to us from the Senate, and my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170558" Type="2">Pickering—Scarborough East</Affiliation>, has outlined some very good cases to show why this bill is in the public good. I would also point members of this place to the Criminal Code, section 718, which outlines the purposes of sentencing. It is important, particularly for some of my friends on the other side, to remember some of the factors in this aspect.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849129">Denunciation of unlawful conduct is a purpose and a principle of sentencing. The promotion of responsibility and acknowledging of harms to victims and their community is also a principle and a purpose of sentencing that the Criminal Code requires consideration of when someone judged to be guilty of an offence under the Criminal Code is sentenced. </ParaText><ParaText id="3849130">One of the other purposes is rehabilitation of the offender. That should always be part of the mix, but in recent years there has been far too much consideration of just that and not enough consideration of the denunciation of conduct that goes against our community and against the public service aspects of the role of a transit worker. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3849131">This measure would apply broadly. Having lived and worked in Toronto, I have commuted by TTC and by the 501 streetcar, the famous longest-run single-run streetcar in the world, I believe, along Queen, when I lived in the Beaches neighbourhood of Toronto. This measure would not apply just to your typical driver of a bus, subway, or car. It would also include, specifically, school bus operators.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849132">Further, the bill is very smart in that it would apply to vehicles that are not just typical modes of transport. They would also include paratransit vehicles, licensed taxis, trams, and ferries. That is not an exhaustive list. It would incorporate a number of people who perform these duties. </ParaText><ParaText id="3849133">It is a way that Parliament, in entering into that dialogue with our courts, can show that the public, through Canada's Parliament—which includes the Senate, where the bill comes from, and the House of Commons—denounces this type of crime perpetrated against people we charge with something we consider a public good, public transit. It shows that we denounce that conduct and that we are also trying to deter such conduct. Deterrence is also part of sentencing, as I mentioned, and it is a consideration that should be present any time an offender is sentenced.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3849134">I am focusing on denunciation and deterrence as purposes of sentencing because the deterrence aspect can actually help to lead to less crime. It is not the only factor, but it is an important factor, and it is society's way, and Canada's way, to try to discourage and deter crime by imposing a stiffer penalty for such conduct. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="00">(1400)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3849135">What a great way to wrap up before the Thanksgiving break, hearing general all-party support for this important bill. It has been my pleasure to rise today in the House to speak on it, and to particularly thank the transit workers in Durham and the greater Toronto area for the work they do. This is a way we are trying to make sure they know their work is appreciated and they are kept safe.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Dewar" id="8470177"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170296" Type="2">Mr. Paul Dewar (Ottawa Centre, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3849136">Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of this bill, as many of my colleagues are doing. I think everyone in this House is behind this particular legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849137">I want to share a couple of stories. Suzanne Burgess went to work one day. She was taking a layover break, as they call it, in between her runs. She saw a person going across the way, in a precarious and dangerous way. She opened the window to tell her it was too dangerous to be there.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849138">Unfortunately, what ensued was something that should never have happened. This person barged onto the bus, threatening Suzanne with vulgar language. Suzanne immediately radioed for assistance, and when she hung up she was assaulted by the person grabbing and scraping her face and neck and trying to drag her to the floor.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849139">It took 17 minutes before security could reach her. She mentioned that she was so grateful that another driver heard her screams and came to her assistance.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849140">In testimony she said, “I want to help people, not be afraid of them”. She was basically pleading for us to do our job here to protect her in her workplace.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849141">I will share another example of someone who went to work and was exposed to a horrific scenario, something that should never happen in any workplace.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3849142">John Karagiannis went to work as an OC Transpo bus driver. He was threatened by a passenger. He was dragged out onto the sidewalk on Bank Street here. He was beaten up. He had a broken rib. His knees and back were bruised. He had cuts and bruises, as well. He was off work for a long time.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849143">No one should go to work in the kind of environment where they feel threatened. It is important that we understand this.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849144"> I am happy to see the Amalgamated Transit Union bringing this issue up. They are the ones who represent their membership, the workers. They have done a good job of documenting this through health and safety committees; they have heard from their bus drivers. They are basically doing what unions should do. </ParaText><ParaText id="3849145">Sometimes the government likes to beat up on unions, for whatever reason, but in this case we should have a sober reflection on the good work that unions do. Unions are there to represent their membership. It is important that we listen to these stories, and to the Amalgamated Transit Union, which has been carrying the flag for this cause. It is saying that no one should go to work feeling threatened or be in a dangerous work environment. It is a basic health and safety issue.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3849146">It is about people having the ability to go to work without being threatened. I want to underline that point. This is something that the Amalgamated Transit Union has done good work on. I want to give credit to them, as well as other members of Parliament, who have brought forward private members' bills. In fact, it was back in 2010, when <Affiliation DbId="78332" Type="2">Judy Wasylycia-Leis</Affiliation>, my colleague from Winnipeg, brought forward a private member's bill on this, followed by my colleague, <Affiliation DbId="204612" Type="7">our House leader</Affiliation>, and presently we have my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170586" Type="2">Thunder Bay—Rainy River</Affiliation>, who has a private member's bill on this issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849147">It is not from a lack of trying to bring this forward, but at last we are here. I hope that we do get this passed as soon as possible. What most people would note, and my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="190568" Type="2">Durham</Affiliation> enumerated, is that this is not just bus drivers. It is about taxi drivers, people who work on trains, ferries, etcetera, all of those public transportation systems that people rely on.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849148">It is very important because this affects numerous people. When a bus driver is being threatened, it affects the safety of everyone. I have taken the bus many times in Ottawa. Passengers trust that the bus driver is going to keep things calm and is going to ensure the bus is a place of safety.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3849149">When the driver's safety is threatened, it actually means everyone else is threatened. I think we have all experienced times when there has been some chaos or commotion on a bus. People look to the bus driver or the transit operator to bring calm to the situation.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="05">(1405)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3849150">Bill <Document DbId="6580267" Type="4">S-221</Document> is simply saying that we support those workers who are actually providing that service, and not just for getting us from A to B but for making sure it is done in a civil way. Therefore, I am fully supportive of the bill. It is not overstepping in terms of the parameters for judges in sentencing. It is a rational, smart thing to do.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849151">I will finish by saying that I hope the bill is passed for the Susans and Johns who went through such horrific experiences, which has had an effect on them not just physically but emotionally. As one can appreciate, when something like this happens, there are emotional scars that have to heal. They will be the people we look to as examples of what we hope to never see happen in the future.</ParaText><ParaText id="3849152"> What we are trying to do is make sure that workers who go to work every day will not be threatened. After all, if the bus driver, train conductor, cab driver, or the person conducting the ferry does not feel secure, then there is insecurity for the public. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3849153">I am delighted to get behind the bill, as are many of my colleagues. I look forward to it passing as speedily as possible. To that end, I thank all those who have brought this to our attention. I really want to cite the Amalgamated Transit Union here in Ottawa for doing great work.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
