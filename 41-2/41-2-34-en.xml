              <ParaText id="3530028">The petitioners are calling on this House to take note of the fact that fracking chemicals, used in the fracking industry, are not even known to Environment Canada. The Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development found that we do not even know what, of the many thousands of chemicals used and injected underground, they are actually are and how we could cope with them as an environmental risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530029">The petitioners call for a federal moratorium on fracking across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530030">The second petition is from residents in the lower mainland, mostly in Vancouver. The petitioners are calling for a permanent legislative ban on supertankers along the coast of British Columbia. Such a ban was respected since the early 1970s, at all levels, and we ask for it to be permanent.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3530057">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that a request for an emergency debate on the mortality of bees might not be something that the House would usually engage itself in, but I want to bring this forward as an emergency debate because Health Canada and others have all noted over the last two years an increasing mortality rate of bees, which is unusually high.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530058">Why is that important to Canadians? It is because one third of our food sources are pollenated by insects, primarily by bees. There is not much greater emergency than not eating. There is a variety of reasons put forward by experts as to why this is happening, but for the last two years it has been happening and it has been a massive kill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530059">The reason I am asking for an emergency debate now is that this is effectively the last time that we will be able to engage in debate for the next six weeks. Over the next period of time, the farmers will be buying their seeds. They will also be buying pesticides, so if we have a debate in late January, early February, there is not much that Health Canada or the Government of Canada could do because the seedings will be prepared, the pesticides prepared, the farmers will be prepared. Therefore, we will have another crop rotation through 2014, the effect of which is to postpone the ability of the Government of Canada or anyone else for that matter, to do anything about it until 2015.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530060">The cumulative effect of this increased kill rate on bees is quite significant to our food chain, Mr. Speaker, and I would ask you to give serious thought to this being the last opportunity that we in the House have to discuss this issue. I am not proposing solutions. I think this is a complex issue. I think Health Canada at this point is on top of it, but at some point, and I would hope sooner rather than later, we may have to take actions such as the European Union has taken and such as the United States is considering to deal with this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530061">That is the basis for an emergency debate tonight, sir, and I hope you will favourably look upon it.</ParaText>

Being criticized for one's position is just part of the job for any individual who seeks elected office.</ParaText>

Sometimes that criticism may be extremely harsh. Sometimes that criticism may be hurtful. Quite frankly, sometimes that criticism may be unfair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530083">However, the point is that when we enter the political arena, when we seek elected office, we put ourselves up to the level of criticism experienced by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170229" Type="2">Terrebonne—Blainville</Affiliation>.

However, if all members in this place raised points of privilege any time they received an unwelcome communication from one of their constituents, I would suggest to you, Mr. Speaker, we would not get much done in this place.

              <ParaText id="3530110">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your earlier explanation as to why it is that the amendments are coming forward at report stage. I appreciate your consideration of the fact that due to a clerical error at committee, we did not receive notice to bring amendments forward at committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530111">I must say that I am pleased. I have found that the so-called invitations to committees circumvent rights. I am able, at this point, to speak at report stage to what is a very significant flaw in this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530112">As everyone in the House knows, Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9</Document> initially came to us through the Senate as Bill <Document DbId="5307346" Type="3">S-6</Document>. It is a first nations elections act. Except for everything I am attempting to amend this morning, it is a good bill. It provides more precision in first nations elections. The bulk of the bill is a result of recommendations that came from first nations themselves, specifically from the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs and the Atlantic Policy Congress of First Nations Chiefs, which represents the Mi'kmaq, Maliseet, and Passamaquoddy first nations of Atlantic Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530113">Before I move to my amendments, the intent of the good parts of the bill was to provide greater precision, to create set terms, and to provide for those first nations that had already opted in to elections under the terms of the Indian Act. That is worth underlining. The recommendations that came from the first nations themselves were to apply only to those first nations that had themselves already opted in to elections under the Canada Elections Act and not to those many first nations that elect their councils through traditional customs and methods other than under the Indian Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530114">In any case, I will set aside the parts of the bill that are acceptable and will focus only on the amendments you have just read before the House of Commons. They both go to correct the mistakes that are found in clause 3 of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530115">Parenthetically, I want to note that today is international Human Rights Day. Today is the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Vienna Declaration, which brought respect for human rights to the entire community of nations. Why is it relevant that we are looking at a first nations elections act? What about that is relevant to the fact that ironically, today is Human Rights Day? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530116">The problem with this bill and the sections I hope to correct is also found in other bills that have come forward from this administration, such as the bill, not yet tabled, on first nations education. It is also found in bills that have been tabled, such as the NWT devolution in Bill <Document DbId="6349930" Type="3">C-15</Document> and this bill, Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9</Document>. What they all have in common is a failure to respect the constitutionally enshrined right of first nations to be consulted about changes that impact them directly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530117">In Bill <Document DbId="6349930" Type="3">C-15</Document>, in addition to the NWT devolution, which everyone supports, there are substantial changes to the Mackenzie Valley regulatory systems that are part of first nations agreements and treaties, without consultation with or the consent of first nations. This brings to mind that these changes are actually questionable constitutionally under section 35 of the Constitution, as interpreted in many Supreme Court decisions. From the Haida case and the Delgamuukw case to the Marshall case, it is clear that first nations in this country are protected under section 35 of the Constitution. Further, the federal government has a fiduciary responsibility, a constitutionally enshrined obligation, to consult with first nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530118">In this case, we have something that is, in my view, outrageous. Under paragraphs 3(1)(b) and (c), there are two ways in which the minister may impose upon first nations, based on his or her own discretion, a different system for elections within the first nation. What could be more critical in touching on the rights of first nations than changing the way a first nation conducts its own internal elections? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530119">These two paragraphs that are objectionable state that the minister may add the name of the first nations to the schedule of first nations that must conduct their elections as under the act. In other words, the bulk of the act is for first nations themselves to opt in and request to be seen under these sections of a new Indian Act procedure found in Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9</Document>.</ParaText>

They will preserve that ability, which is enshrined in our Constitution and enshrined in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and is therefore further protected under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which today has its 20th anniversary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530134">I appeal to my colleagues in the House to assess this amendment. It would preserve the right of first nations that are operating their elections under traditional custom to maintain those rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530135">The second amendment would deal with this quite discretionary notion of protracted leadership disputes. We have seen instances when the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs, or DIAND, as it was in the past, decides that, for instance, the ministry does not like the way things are going, to use an example, in the first nations of the Algonquin of Barriere Lake. The dispute is real, and the minister ends up taking sides. That is hardly respect for a first nations' right to self-determination and self-government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530136">In this amendment, I propose that the minister may not take that step unless, having obtained the opinion of a representative sample of electors of that first nation, those within the first nation are satisfied that they need to have the minister take this step. Otherwise, we have made a mockery in Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9</Document> of first nations rights under our constitution. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530137">We will again do so if we fail to change Bill <Document DbId="6349930" Type="3">C-15</Document> for the first nations within the Northwest Territories and some that are affected in neighbouring areas of the Yukon, where the first nations in that area have competing land claims issues. The leadership of the Tlicho as well as the Dene and other nations are appealing to have the bill split apart so that we can proceed with NWT devolution without offending first nations rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530138">There is a pattern here with this administration of, bit by bit, chipping away at some fundamental rights in this country that are constitutionally enshrined and further protected by international law.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3530157">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to also take a few minutes to speak to Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9, An Act respecting the election and term of office of chiefs and councillors of certain First Nations and the composition of council of those First Nations</Document>. Like my colleague, the leader of the Green Party, we were not asked to submit amendments to the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development. That is why the Speaker has given us permission to discuss these amendments at this point, the report stage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530158">Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9</Document> provides an alternative to the regime in the Indian Act governing the election of chiefs and councillors in certain first nations. As I said earlier when I questioned the member for <Affiliation DbId="170542" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation>, the Bloc Québécois of course fully supports the transparency, accountability and better governance that Bill C-9 provides for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530159">The problem does not lie in the bill itself or in the improvements that I just mentioned. The problem is the way in which the government imposed its solutions and opinions on first nations. That is what I am going to try to demonstrate, and I am also going to introduce my amendment in the next few minutes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530160">The Bloc Québécois agrees with the provisions in the bill limiting terms of office for chiefs and councillors to a maximum of four years, stating that the election of a chief or councillor may be contested before a competent court, and setting out offences and penalties. However, we oppose the fact that the Conservative government did not consult the first nations before going ahead with these major changes to the Indian Act. These are unilateral changes. As usual, the government acted paternalistically. When I say the government, I am talking about successive federal governments. The government paternalistically imposes unilateral changes on the first nations when it should know that we must talk, nation to nation, when working with aboriginal peoples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530161">Everyone agrees that there must be more transparency, not only during elections but also during each elected official's term of office. The government can give us examples of times when band councils or other councils, chiefs, leaders and councillors—as we see in any population—failed to govern appropriately. That is not the issue. First, as the Green Party member said earlier, this bill originated in the Senate. However, before introducing this bill, the government should have done what the Government of Quebec did in 2002, which I will talk about in a moment. The government should have sat down and talked, nation to nation, in order to come to an agreement and propose changes. The government would have no doubt received the unanimous support of the House for the bill had the bill first been approved by first nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530162">However, we cannot do anything without considering the first nations rights affected by this bill, the direct impact this bill will have on the structures in the communities themselves and how that can affect the communities. The first nations are not opposed to the changes proposed by the federal government. They want to be consulted and be involved in the decisions that will have a direct impact on them. That is a dialogue as opposed to a monologue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530163">We are asking the Conservative government to sit down and have a dialogue, negotiate, come to an agreement with the first nations. We do not want it to have a dialogue of the deaf or a monologue in which it tells the first nations what is good for them. This goes back to what I was saying earlier when I described the attitudes of federal governments since the very beginning. They have shown a paternalistic attitude towards the first nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530164">I used the example of the peace of the braves, and I want to come back to that. This was a historic agreement signed in 2002 by the Cree and the Government of Quebec, led at the time by Bernard Landry, the leader of the Parti Québécois. The peace of the braves is a good example. There were some economic improvements for many peoples, but there are still many problems. I am not saying it is a good example because everything was fixed. It is a good example of how negotiation can lead to a formal agreement, so that the people and communities involved agree with the changes being proposed and carried out. The Quebec National Assembly recognized the first nations as nations, and the peace of the braves is an agreement between nations, as Bernard Landry pointed out when he was interviewed by a journalist who was reporting on what had become of the peace of the braves several years later.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="55">(1055)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3530165">I would like to remind the hon. members that Quebec made a commitment to involve the Cree in northern development and give them $4.5 billion over 50 years. In exchange, the Cree put an end to certain land claims. A few months later, Quebec signed the Sanarrutik agreement with the Inuit, which is designed to accelerate economic and community growth in Quebec's far north.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530166">The peace of the braves and the agreement signed between Ottawa and the Cree of Eeyou Istchee in 2008 brought prosperity to Quebec's Cree. The 16,000 aboriginal people of James Bay now have some of the highest levels of disposable personal income in Quebec, according to a 2011 article in <I>La Presse</I>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530167">However, as I said, things are far from perfect. There are still health problems and a housing shortage. There is still an unequal distribution of wealth, despite the fact that some people are better off. Right now, 92% of Cree youth interrupt their schooling before earning their diploma or some sort of certification. As I said, the agreement was not a cure-all, but it is a good example of negotiation. That is the point I wanted to make about the peace of the braves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530168">I do not understand why governments that, generally speaking, like precedents so much could not have used that 2002 agreement as a precedent to create a bill that is endorsed by the affected first nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530169">Now, I want to talk about the Assembly of First Nations of Quebec and Labrador, which long ago developed a consultation protocol that the government is supposed to follow when drafting bills or taking action that affects first nations in Quebec and Labrador.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530170">This protocol includes the duty to consult and accommodate first nations before taking actions that could have a negative impact on their interests. Such actions include the modification or adoption of legislation, policy-making, planning processes, the modification or adoption of resource allocation regimes and the approval of specific projects or resource allocations. A consultation and accommodation report must be prepared. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530171">The protocol also includes the duty to conduct consultation and accommodation follow-up. What is more, as provided in the consultation plan, provision must be made for the establishment, funding and operation of mechanisms for follow-up, mitigation measures and compliance monitoring with respect to the contemplated action. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530172">The first nations have therefore already set out a procedure that should be followed by the other levels of government, including the federal government. It is really unfortunate that the government decided to bypass the Assembly of First Nations of Quebec and Labrador's consultation protocol. We hope that the implementation of this bill is not harmful to first nations communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530173">Members of the House agree that the Assembly of First Nations' protocol was not followed and that the bill will be passed because the government has a majority. That is why the Bloc Québécois is proposing to amend the bill in order to, at the very least, respect the second part of the protocol, which involves assessing the bill's impact on first nations communities. We are therefore proposing the following amendment to clause 41.1:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530174">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Within one year after the coming into force of this Act and every three years thereafter, the Minister must prepare a report on the implementation of this Act and its effects on elections of band councils and elections on reserves.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530175">I would like to once again speak about precedents. People might ask why we are proposing this when such a measure has never been implemented before. However, this type of measure has been implemented before in Bill <Document DbId="3095171" Type="3">C-21</Document>, which pertained to the repeal of section 67 of the Canadian Human Rights Act and affected first nations. At the time, the government had a minority. The opposition required that the changes be reviewed every five years and the bill was passed by a majority vote. A precedent therefore exists.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530176">In closing, we would have also liked to introduce funding and mitigation measures, but unfortunately, they would have been deemed inadmissible. However, we would like to take this opportunity to urge the government to implement those sorts of measures.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3530231">As with everything we do as a government, this bill is about delivering results for Canadians and addressing the priorities of Canadians. That most certainly includes the priorities of first nations citizens of this country, who are currently living under the outdated and discriminatory Indian Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530232">As the matters this bill addresses are a priority for first nations, this bill is about empowering first nations across Canada to take charge of their own destinies. In fact, it may easily be said that this is not a government bill, but a first nations bill. The government did not go to first nations with a proposal; first nations came to the government with one. They said, “Here is a serious problem and here is how the government can help us solve it.” Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9</Document> before us today is not the result of the government consulting with first nations; it is the result of first nations consulting with first nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530233">I should add that our government was proud to provide the support and coordination that helped first nations engage with each other on a national basis. As the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170271" Type="2">St. Paul's</Affiliation> stated at a recent meeting of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development:</ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">We think this is an excellent example of bottom-up legislation.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530235">I could not agree more with the Liberal member. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530236">In that regard, I must recognize the initiative and determination of two first nations organizations that have played a pivotal role in bringing us to this day and giving us the opportunity to provide a legislative framework that is indisputably better than what first nations have been saddled with for decades. This is not simply duplicate legislation to the Indian Act, but an effective, accountable, and responsible option for first nations communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530237">It was over five years ago that the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, led by then Grand Chief Ron Evans, and the Atlantic Policy Congress of First Nations Chiefs, with the support of our government, began the efforts that ultimately resulted in the bill that is before us today. They saw the need for electoral reform. They had good ideas for improvement. They consulted with the leaders of their local communities and with the people who live in those communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530238">Half a country apart, they found a remarkable similarity of opinion emerging from these consultations. The quality and scope of these consultations and the close parallels to be drawn between their recommendations encouraged the government to ask the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs and the Atlantic Policy Congress of First Nation Chiefs to lead a national consultation process. The Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs covered the west and the Atlantic Policy Congress of First Nation Chiefs handled the east. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530239">The consultations included not only chiefs and band councils; from the beginning, they recognized the importance of including individual grassroots band members across Canada. Both organizations gave the consultations a prominent place on their websites. They published their recommendations and explained what they meant and what they intended to achieve. A simple feedback form enabled and encouraged individuals to provide their thoughts and opinions on the initiatives being proposed. I would point out that this feedback carried considerable weight with the government in developing this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530240">As a result, in supporting Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9</Document>, we have the opportunity to endorse not only its contents, but the truly inclusive and collaborative process that led to its creation, an example of how first nations people, their leaders, their representative organizations, and the federal government can work collaboratively to find solutions and achieve a common goal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530241">It is difficult to imagine a more laudable goal than ensuring that all first nations citizens have the opportunity to participate in free and fair elections. However, the fact is that for many first nations governed by the outdated and archaic Indian Act, the most basic premise of democratic government does not exist. The failures of the Indian Act with respect to elections are well known and long-standing, dating back to the early 1950s. Even before the development of the bill before us today, more than 75 first nations communities decided to take matters into their own hands and move out of the Indian Act to design and implement their own community election codes.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3530242">Adoption of the proposed electoral system described in the bill is voluntary. The bill is intended to provide an option for first nations that may not have the capacity to develop their own community election code or that simply want a turnkey and accountable election code that they can opt into.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530243"> Let us consider some of the shortcomings the bill would address.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530244">The Indian Act, for example, specifies the chief and band councillors are elected on a two-year term. This is hardly conducive to the design and execution of the long-term strategies needed to achieve key priorities. It also means that first nation communities are in almost constant election mode. By the time a first nation council has been elected, sworn in, got a handle on its responsibilities and started the actual process of governing, it is time to start campaigning for the next election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530245">Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9</Document> would enable first nation communities to fix that by implementing four-year terms for elected officials, bringing them into line with what is the norm for most other jurisdictions in Canada and allow time to not only learn the job but time to actually do the job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530246">In addition, the bill would enable different first nations to hold their elections on the same day, a common election day. This innovative idea came directly from the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, and it is a good one. With terms of office beginning and ending at the same time, common election days would make it easier for groups of first nations to collaborate and present a common front in business development endeavours and other shared priorities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530247">Longer terms in office and the potential to set common election dates are important improvements, but any elected official's term is too long if the legitimacy of the electoral process is in question. This is perhaps the most damaging impact of the electoral system provided under the Indian Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530248">The sort of checks and balances that allow most Canadians to take for granted the results of an election as an accurate reflection of the will of the people are virtually non-existent in the Indian Act. We have all heard of cases of vote buying and other irregularities, irregularities that even if they do not effect the legitimacy of an election can cause it to be perceived as such.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530249">There is little in the Indian Act to discourage these practices. They can be carried on with little or no consequences. This not only undermines confidence in government, but leads to paralyzing appeals of election results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530250">Under the Indian Act, anyone who does not like the way in which an election has turned out can simply appeal the results by providing a sworn affidavit to the minister regardless of the merits or validity of their arguments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530251">In addition, the appeal system under the Indian Act is slow and administratively cumbersome. Many months can go by before a decision is rendered. In the majority of cases the appeals are dismissed, but in the meantime with its legitimacy in question, a first nations government comes to a virtual standstill. Projects and initiatives that can benefit a community may be stalled. To add insult to injury, the Indian Act includes the paternalistic provision that all appeals are decided by the minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530252">Similar to the provisions of the Canada Elections Act, Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9</Document> contains provisions that would minimize the likelihood of corrupt election practices by setting out specific offences and specific penalties for those convicted of committing those offences. Instead of appealing to the minister, an elector would file an appeal in federal or provincial court. These appeals would be addressed by the courts, just as they are for federal, provincial and municipal elections. This provision would minimize the potential for frivolous appeals and at the same time remove the minister from the process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530253">Local law enforcements could lay charges for corrupt activity in connection with first nations elections and they would have the backing of the courts to impose fines and jail sentences on those convicted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530254">Again, these are the kinds of protections, which most Canadians take for granted, that help to ensure the electoral processes are accountable, consistent and effective and that help to provide for political stability that is so essential to economic growth, job creation and higher standards of living.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530255">The first nations elections act would also encourage greater citizen engagement in the political process by eliminating anomalies and other peculiarities that the Indian Act's lack of clarity has allowed to happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530256">The nomination process is perhaps the most glaring example. Under the Indian Act, the same person can run for chief and for council in the same election. Not only can the same person run for both positions, the same person can be elected to and serve in both positions. That would change under Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9</Document>.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3530257">In addition, the Indian Act provides little guidance on other aspects of the nomination process. If he or she wishes, one person can nominate dozens or more candidates for any position. It is not unheard of for a first nations voter to be handed a ballot with more than 100 candidates listed on it, sometimes without the knowledge of those candidates. This hardly encourages citizens' engagement. That too would change under Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530258">The first nations elections act would enable first nations to implement a more stringent nomination process. First nations could impose a fee of up to $250 to discourage the nomination of candidates who were not interested and were simply running as a lark.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530259"> Under Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9</Document>, first nations would also have the authority to require all candidates nominated to accept their nomination in writing so the names of people with no desire or interest would not appear on the ballot. Other provisions in the bill would enable the development of regulations to address frequently expressed concerns about the potential for abuse in the distribution of mail-in ballots.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530260">In conclusion, I would point out that neither this provision nor anything else in the bill goes beyond what is the norm for most Canadians. Through the consultations led by the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs and the Atlantic Policy Congress of First Nations Chiefs, we have learned that first nations citizens want to have the option to divest themselves of the Indian Act provisions and to a new consistent and accountable system similar to that which is enjoyed by all other Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530261">I would emphasize again that adopting the first nations elections act would not be mandatory for first nations. Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9</Document> is intended to provide an option for those first nations that are having difficulty with the status quo. They may want a more robust electoral system than what is proposed under the Indian Act, but may not have the capacity to design their own. They may have a community electoral system in place that is not working as well as they had hoped. This is an option and it would be flexible. Many of the provisions themselves would be optional, the nomination fee, for example, so it could be tailored to the specific circumstances of individual communities. It is an option that first nations themselves have asked us to provide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530262">I am confident all members of the House understand and support the belief that a strong, robust electoral system that assures elections are free and fair encourages citizen engagement and promotes good governance. I would urge all members to compare the option the bill would provide to first nations with the electoral system currently provided for in the Indian Act. The problems allowed by the Indian Act's lack of clarity could be exceptionally damaging. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530263">Let me give the words used by Mr. John Paul, executive director of the Atlantic Policy Congress of First Nations Chiefs in a recent appearance before the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. He said:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3530265">Too many first nations have been struggling under the kind of electoral system described by Mr. Paul. It is why Mr. Paul and first nations leaders and individuals across the country came to the government with a plan to give those first nations a better option, the option that Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9</Document> would provide. The bill is the result of a true grassroots movement and it reflects broad and legitimate consensus among the people who want this option. I would argue that our task is as clear as it is simple. We need only to step out of the way.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3530267">He is absolutely correct that the Assembly of National Chiefs and the Atlantic Policy Congress did carry out a consultation process, but in the briefing that was provided to committee members, the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs had a frame that it carried out the consultation under. It was the fact that it was looking at new election legislation affording a common election date and longer terms of office.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3530325">On that point, I will refer back to clause 3(1)(a), which would allow a band to opt in to the legislation by making a request through a band council resolution. By simple band council resolution, the band could have a first nation participate and opt in. However, if a first nation finds that this piece of legislation does not work for it and wants to opt out, under paragraphs 42(1)(a), 42(1)(b), and 42(1)(c), it is a far more complicated procedure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530326"> Under this section of the proposed act, for a first nation to opt out if it finds it does not work, the community election code has to contain an amending formula. Also, the question of a first nation being removed from the act must be submitted to a community vote in which electors must vote by secret ballot. The minister would only remove a first nation from the act if at least 50% of all eligible electors cast a vote and if a majority of these votes were in favour of the community election code and the removal of that schedule. The requirement to publish the code would ensure that all members would have the opportunity to read and become acquainted with the election code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530327">It is a simple band council resolution to get in, but it is a complicated process to get out. It comes back to the fact that what the government really wants to do is force people into this proposed piece of legislation and then not let them get out of it if it does not work for them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3530347">I want to touch on one of the recommendations that came out of the Senate report, “First Nations Elections: The Choice is Inherently Theirs”. Recommendation 3 states:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530348">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, in collaboration and consultation with the appropriate First Nations and/or Treaty Organizations, take immediate steps to establish a First Nations Electoral and Appeals Commission, operating on a national and/or regional basis, empowered to hear appeals arising from First Nations elections and to promote and strengthen First Nations electoral capacity.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530349">That is a very important recommendation that has come from a number of different bodies. I referred earlier to the JMAC study that was conducted. The Senate held numerous hearings across the country to hear from first nations and their representatives about some proposed changes to the Elections Act. That is explicitly not mentioned in this piece of legislation. It would be an important avenue to provide community members an appeal process that would perhaps allow for appeals to be heard in their own language, because as far as I know, there are not too many federal or provincial court judges who speak many of the indigenous languages across this country. It would be a process that would respect custom codes and some of the traditions that our first nations communities may have. That is one recommendation that was not included in the bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530350">I want to touch on the regulatory process for one moment because much of the changes in the act will happen under regulations. Under the regulatory process, clause 41 states, “The Governor in Council may make regulations with respect to elections, including regulations respecting...”.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3530351">It includes appointments, powers, duties, removal of electoral officers, a requirement that electoral officers be certified, the manner of identifying electors of a participating first nation, the manner in which candidates may be nominated, the imposition by participating first nations of a fee on each candidate, the manner in which voting is to be carried out, the removal from office of a chief or councillor of a participating first nation by means of petition, the holding of by-elections, and “anything else that by this Act is to be prescribed”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530352">Those are pretty broad powers that are outlined in the regulatory process. Unlike other regulatory processes where there was at least some notion of working with first nations, nothing in Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9</Document> talks about how first nations will be consulted and accommodated with regard to developing the regulations. This is a very important piece.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530353">For the benefit of people who may be listening, by and large, most regulatory processes have absolutely no parliamentary oversight, as we have seen in other regulatory processes. The regulations are posted, there is a period of time where the public can comment, the regulations are modified based on public input, and then they are adopted. Neither parliamentary committees nor Parliament has any oversight on those regulations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530354">With the broad range of activities that would be included in these regulations, it is very important to include in this piece of legislation exactly how first nations will be included in developing these regulations, which will have a direct impact on how elections are conducted in their communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530355">Part of the reason why that process needed to be spelled out was that there is a deep and abiding mistrust of how the government conducts consultation, or what it is now calling stakeholder engagement because it knows that stakeholder engagement does not meet the test of what the Supreme Court has laid out for a consultation process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530356">We only have to look at Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9</Document> to find that the government took a step toward a consultation process by engaging the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs and the Atlantic Policy Congress, but then expanded the scope of the bill to that which was not included in the terms of reference for the consultation process that was conducted by AMC and APC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530357"> We also have before us a draft piece of legislation called the first nations education act, which is another example where there is a deep mistrust of the consultation process. In fact, today there will be a rally on Parliament Hill protesting the government's direction on consultation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530358">At the committee stage, the NDP did propose a couple of amendments that would have improved the bill. We voted against clause 3(1)(b) and (c) at the committee stage so that they would be removed, which would remove the ministerial jurisdiction. We also asked for a report back to Parliament because we want parliamentary oversight on the regulations. That proposed amendment, which was voted down in committee, proposed that for any amendments made to the regulations or the schedule respecting the additions or removals of first nations, orders of the minister respecting the coming into force of any community election codes, names of persons who have been convicted of an offence under the act and penalized accordingly, applications submitted to a competent court regarding the contested election of the chief or council of a participating first nation and any decision made by that court, petitions for the removal of office of the chief or councillor, the minister must cause a copy of the report to be tabled in each house of Parliament on any of the first sitting days after which the House is sitting, and so on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530359">We did attempt to improve the piece of legislation before us so that at least it would reflect some of the concerns and provide some parliamentary oversight both to the regulatory process and the legislation itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530360">Based on those facts, we cannot support the bill. If the government wants to claim it is engaging in consultation, it must adhere to the principles around consultation, which means that it must provide the resources and the information. It must listen and then take what it hears and make sure it is reflected in the legislation that comes before the House.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3530383">Mr. Speaker, one shakes one's head as one begins to discuss this bill. It could have been a bill that got total support across the House, but yet again, the government just cannot help itself. It cannot help itself putting something in that is just totally unacceptable to the majority of first nations in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530384">It is about two paragraphs. First, all the government had to do was not put in the two paragraphs. Second, it should just remove them. The official opposition, ourselves, the Green Party and everybody else is asking the government to take out these two paragraphs. Then, we would finally get on with a piece of legislation that is first nations-led and supported by the House of Commons. It could have begun a process of first nations being able to suggest and put forward legislation that Canada would expeditiously get through and support. Instead, the government just cannot help itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530385">The process began, as we say, in a good way. It began with the development of a bill that was led by first nations. The Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs and the Atlantic Policy Congress of First Nation Chiefs worked closely with the government to develop a new set of optional election rules that first nations could choose to adopt and remedy many of the flaws in the Indian Act election rules.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530386">Both the AMC and APC facilitated consultations. Many of the issues identified by those consultations are reflected in Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9</Document>.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="05">(1205)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3530387">The bill would establish a regime, alternative to the one under the Indian Act, to govern the election of chiefs and councillors of certain first nations. This regime would provide that chiefs and councillors hold office for four years; provide that the election of a chief or councillor may be contested before a competent court; and set out offences and penalties in relation to the election of a chief of councillor.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530388">The bill would also allow first nations to withdraw from the regime by adopting a written code that sets out the rules regarding the election of the members of their council.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3530389">Both the AMC and APC-facilitated consultations, again, are reflected in those clauses. That is why it is such a shame that the minister has insisted on snatching defeat from the jaws of victory with this current version of Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9</Document>, with these two totally aggravating paragraphs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530390">While much of the bill is largely based on the consultations with first nations, the Conservatives included elements that were not supported during the consultations, and have refused to remove or amend the offending sections.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530391">Yet again, the government does not seem to understand what consultation means. Consultation means actually asking the opinions of first nations and listening, and then doing what has been suggested. Instead, yet again, the government thinks consultations are actually information sessions that just tell first nations what they are going to do and presume they will just accept it, love it and live with it; and indeed, it is the ultimate paternalism to put in these two paragraphs that give the minister these unprecedented powers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530392">In particular, Grand Chief Nepinak, grand chief of the AMC, has highlighted the minister's ability to bring first nations under the legislation without their consent. As we know, the AMC was one of the proponents of this bill and now the grand chief is seriously clear that the lack of a first nations appeal process and the conduct of draws to resolve tie votes in elections for band council chiefs and councillors are areas of real concern.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530393">However, what is most appalling is Grand Chief Nepinak's first point, which was the minister's refusal to keep the bill truly optional, unlike how it was sold during discussions with first nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530394">In fact, Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9</Document> would give the <Affiliation DbId="191408" Type="4">Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development</Affiliation> broad discretionary powers that go against the opt-in nature of the legislation. The opt-in nature of this legislation had total support, and instead the Conservatives have inserted these two paragraphs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530395">In paragraphs 3(1)(b) and 3(1)(c), the bill would provide the minister with explicit powers to bring a first nation, currently under the Indian Act system or a custom code, under Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9</Document> when the minister finds “...that a protracted leadership dispute has significantly compromised governance of that First Nation”, in paragraph 3(1)(b), and the Governor in Council has, under section 79 of the Indian Act, set aside an election of a first nation on the basis of the minister's finding of “...corrupt practice in connection with that election”, in paragraph 3(1)(c).</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530396">Given the opt-in nature of Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9</Document>, it is completely unacceptable that the Conservative government has included a clause that would provide the minister broad discretion to force first nations under the act. Forcing first nations under an act is not exactly opting in. Opting in is what first nations agreed to in their support of this legislation. Now we have clauses that would allow the minister to force a first nation under Bill C-9.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530397">The minister's power grab has turned what could have been a positive tool for first nations governance into unnecessarily divisive legislation. In fact, one of the two initial first nations partners in creating this legislation, the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, is now strongly opposed to the bill. Further, while the level of consultations may have been sufficient if the bill were truly voluntary, opt-in legislation, the minister's insistence on inserting discretionary powers to force a first nation under the bill means that much broader consultation across the country would have been required.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530398">According to the Atlantic Policy Congress of First Nations Chiefs' report on the engagement process, the level of feedback received from first nations was uneven across the country and, the report notes that little or no feedback was obtained in Ontario and Quebec. This may well be because, in a truly opt-in piece of legislation, the first nations understood that they would have the ability to opt in or not. The fact that now the nature of this legislation has totally changed, giving the minister these unprecedented powers, means this level of consultation is totally unacceptable.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3530403"> Although there are other improvements that could have been made, such as creating a new independent and impartial first nations elections appeal body instead of relying on the courts, returning the bill to a truly optional piece of legislation would have made it more acceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530404"> Grand Chief Nepinak told the aboriginal affairs committee, while he still had concerns over the bill, “I think it does become a little more palatable if you remove that broad discretion of the minister”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530405">If the Conservatives had agreed to our proposed amendment to remove this discretion, this would have been a much more acceptable piece of legislation to both first nations and the Liberal Party. The minister has suggested this power is necessary to fill a gap that would be created if he did not have it. He also stated that if he is going to impose an electoral system on a first nation, as he currently can under the Indian Act, he would prefer to impose this one.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="10">(1210)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3530406">What the minister does not seem to understand is the inherent paternalism in that statement. The minister does have similar powers under the Indian Act. However, this legislation was sold as purely opt in during all of the consultations. The minister is essentially saying that unilaterally changing the fundamental character of the bill is acceptable if it gives him a better option when he decides to step in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530407">This new optional legislation should not be used as a vehicle for the minister to have another option when imposing any electoral system upon a first nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530408">Further, the degree of discretion the minister has given himself is truly worrying. The terms “protracted leadership dispute” and “significantly compromise government” are not defined in the legislation. These terms, which would trigger the minister's ability to impose the legislation, are therefore extremely broad in nature.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530409">This is not, as the parliamentary secretary tried to frame it at committee, the “ability to opt in” and as he stated in the answers to the questions in this debate so far.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530410">This is clearly the ability of a minister to impose a set of rules on a first nation that has not chosen to adopt it. This is therefore not opt in legislation. This is not voluntary legislation. This is legislation which would give the minister the ability to force a first nation under the power of this act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530411">We truly feel this is insulting only because all of the work that the AMC and APC put into this project. Here is this impressive piece of work that was generated bottom up by the AMC and the APC. It is really upsetting to us, as the Liberal Party of Canada, to have to impose what could have been a very important precedent in first nation generated legislation because of their inability to remove these two egregious subclauses in what could have been totally acceptable legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530412">The government's insistence on inserting this ability to impose these rules upon a first nation has really squandered an opportunity to develop practical legislation in partnership with first nations rather than for them. In fact, this was actually led by first nation organizations and this is the way I think all of us believe we should go forward in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530413">It is too sad that the government just cannot help itself. It had a perfect piece legislation, but it had to insert the poison pill to ensure it could be on the wrong side of what was to be the future of first nations, legislation that would affect them and their people in keeping with the Constitution, and the duty to consult in keeping with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the idea of free, prior and informed consent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530414">Here it was, a first nations' initiative, a first nations' legislation that they put forward, that they consulted on and that everybody was ready to help. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530415">The government cannot help itself. It had to put in some stupid little clause that would ensure we could not support it nor could first nations support it. This is a really sad moment in that there was an opportunity for the government to at least listen to the first nations in the consultation, or remove these clauses at committee or at report stage. No, it is just charging on, forcing this legislation through, which would give this unacceptable power to the minister to force the bill upon first nations that do not opt in, that do not accept or need the legislation in their community, </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530416">It is quite clear the government is just continuing in its paternalism, continuing in the way that it has dealt with matrimonial real property, the way it has dealt with the water bill, with the governance act and is threatening to deal with the education act.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="15">(1215)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3530417">I do not know how the Conservative members of the aboriginal affairs committee can continue to listen to witnesses after witnesses telling them not to go forward on this, that they do not agree. Those Conservative members of Parliament continue to not hear anything that is said at committee or anything that is said in consultation and press on forcing through legislation against the wishes of first nations in the country. It is totally unacceptable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530418">Maybe those Conservatives will come out to the rally at 1 o'clock today. Maybe they will come and hear what first nations and Idle No More have to say about the education act coming up. Maybe they will have a sober second thought when it comes to forcing through even more legislation against the wishes of first nations in the country. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3530444">Mr. Speaker, I am fortunate to have the opportunity to speak in this House on Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9, An Act respecting the election and term of office of chiefs and councillors of certain First Nations and the composition of council of those First Nations</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530445">I stand with my colleagues in the NDP to oppose this bill in the House of Commons. This bill is very important to me as a New Democrat, but most importantly, as the member of Parliament for Churchill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530446">In northern Manitoba, I have the honour of representing 33 first nations. These first nations and the leadership of these first nations have often been at the front lines calling for a nation-to-nation relationship with the federal government. They have been at the front lines pointing to the way in which the Indian Act and a colonial system of legislation imposed on first nations has led to nothing but trouble.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530447">These first nations have made clear the connection between the paternalistic attitude of successive federal governments and the way first nations are not able to deal with the serious issues they face at home, such as the third-world living conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530448">They have talked about the way in which, because of the approach of the federal government, they have not been able to get at the table or have had to struggle to get at the table to discuss basic things such as ensuring proper water and sewer services in their communities, ensuring that there is adequate housing for the people who live in their communities, and ensuring that there is equal funding for education in their communities. At every step along the way, these first nations have been told that the federal government and the <Affiliation DbId="191408" Type="4">Minister of Aboriginal Affairs</Affiliation> know best. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530449">It is 2013, and if there is anything we have learned from our history, it is that the <Affiliation DbId="191408" Type="4">Minister of Aboriginal Affairs</Affiliation> and the federal government do not know what is best for first nations. There are many incidents in our history that indicate just that, such as the residential schools, a policy that was supported by the federal government, a policy that was seen by the federal government overtly as a tool of assimilation and as the way to go. We know that it was a policy that has created long-term trauma and damage for first nations people in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530450">We had the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, a number of years ago, doing something that many first nations took very seriously. He apologized to first nations, Métis, and Inuit people for the federal government's approach towards them. He committed to a new day, a new chapter, when it came to indigenous people in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530451">That day has not come. First nations people in Canada are still waiting for that day. Allies of first nations people are still waiting for that day. Instead, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his government have used that important symbol, the apology, as a tactic to wash themselves of the responsibility and duty to truly change course.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530452">What they did after that apology, and every step along the way, was adhere to the same old paternalistic approach, which is that the federal government knows best. However, it makes it look as if it is engaging in some consultation. We do acknowledge that in the context of this bill, there were discussions and round tables that took place around the country. Unfortunately, the government took the feedback it got at these round tables and basically shelved it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530453">The government chose the discourse that suited it and came up with a bill that does not reflect the needs of first nations people. It does not reflect the real issues first nations people face in terms of their electoral system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530454">Instead, what the government's bill would do is give greater power to the <Affiliation DbId="191408" Type="4">Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development</Affiliation> to decide how electoral systems exist in first nations. It would take away power and models that first nations people have developed that work for them. The government has made it more difficult in terms of the appeal process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530455"> It is really a slap in the face of first nations people when we are talking about that new chapter.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3530456">I have stood in the House far too many times in the last five years to speak out against bills from the Conservative government that would have a negative impact on first nations. I do not speak about them in theory. I have seen what they mean on the ground. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530457">I have visited these first nations. I have heard from people first-hand what it is like to feel as if they still live in a time when paternalism rules the day. I have talked to chiefs who have fought to come to Ottawa to sit at the table with the <Affiliation DbId="191408" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>, if they get that meeting. They have poured their hearts out about the pain in their communities, whether it is about housing, water and sewer services, or health care, only to be told to wait longer or that the federal government will come up with something. Instead, all we see, bill after bill, are bills that exclude first nations' voices. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530458">It is great to have a process that listens to people, but if the final result, the final bill and the final piece of legislation, do not reflect what these people said, the Conservative government is not living up to its duty to consult. The constant paternalistic tone of knowing better has a detrimental effect on the ability of first nations to push forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530459">Yesterday I was part of the special committee on missing and murdered indigenous women. It is a perfect example of the way the Conservative government is refusing to listen to first nations on the issues that really matter. A constituent of mine, Brenda Bignell, said that we need a national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women. We are a committee. We are looking for recommendations. Brenda Bignell's recommendation is one we could consider for our report. However, we have already heard from the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> that he does not feel that there needs to be a national inquiry into missing and murdered aboriginal women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530460">What do we tell Brenda Bignell? She has lost her stepmom, her cousin, and her brother. She talked about all of these stories. Do we say that we want to hear from her but that what she tells us will probably not end up in the end result of what we are doing here? That deeply saddens me. It saddens me to be part of a committee, when I know that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has set the tone on a very important issue for first nations people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530461"> It also saddens me that day after day, week after week, month after month we have proposals by the Conservative government and bills that would change laws in our country that are created without hearing the views of first nations people. The government may have heard them, but the end result certainly does not reflect them. As I said, this has an impact on that working relationship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530462">Idle No More was a movement that came out as a response to Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9</Document>, Bill <Document DbId="5258273" Type="3">C-27</Document>, Bill <Document DbId="5138145" Type="3">S-2</Document>, and all of the bills that have come forward that do not reflect true consultation with first nations people. Idle No More was people at the grassroots level standing up and saying “enough”. It was the first nations, Métis, and Inuit people and their allies who stood up and said that there is a pattern here and they have had enough of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530463">We know that there is a long-term negative impact when it comes to the lack of consultation and the tokenistic approach of picking testimony that suits the government but not actually listening to what everybody has to say. We know that all first nations people suffer when their electoral and governance systems are not allowed to be developed based on what they think is best.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530464">I thought we were past this. I thought that in this year, 2013, we were past this. I thought that after the apology six years ago, we were past this. I thought that after Idle No More, maybe the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his government had gotten the message. Business as usual is not going to work. I thought we were past this, but we clearly are not. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3530465">In addition to all of this, what bothers me is that the government uses its bills to divide our society. I have seen how it has done it in the communities I represent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530466">Parts of my constituency have high numbers of first nations people. Some parts do not. Interestingly, in the last election, the Conservative Party shared literature in the parts of the constituency where not many aboriginal people live that talked about corruption in first nations. It also talked about the chiefs and the councillors and those people who were using taxpayers' money. The government did not engage in a conversation with the people who live on reserve. There were some materials with vague references to accountability and transparency, which are issues we all think are important. Rather, it chose to speak in parts of the constituency and to fan the flames of division and racism. It chose to use examples of legislation to say that it is keeping people in line.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530467">That was not just an election tactic. Unfortunately, it is a governing tactic that I have seen from the government too many times. The Conservatives go out there and use material that says that they know best and will tell the first nations how to run their business. However, they will not invest equally in first nations education or make a difference when it comes to the highest dropout rates in our country. They do not talk about the fact that, on average, aboriginal people live shorter lives than non-aboriginal people in our country. They do not talk about the fact that young first nations women are five times more likely to be killed than young non-first nations women. They do not talk about the fact that, on average, aboriginal people live in more precarious conditions, in poverty, compared to other people in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530468">The government talks about bills that will fix how things get done. The Conservatives will tell aboriginal people how to do it. They will point to a few people who maybe gave some testimony that sounded like what the Conservatives would like to say. They will not listen to people like Grand Chief Nepinak of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, who currently represents first nations from across Manitoba. He said that there are problems and that they have made recommendations, and those recommendations have not been heard. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530469">The government will not listen to Jody Wilson-Raybould, the Regional Chief of the B.C. Assembly of First Nations. It will not listen to Tammy Cook-Searson, the Chief of the Lac La Ronge Indian Band. It will not listen to people like Aimée E. Craft, the past chair of the National Aboriginal Law Section of the Canadian Bar Association. The government will not listen to first nations people who live in places like northern Manitoba. It will not listen to people who want to come to the table, want to work on a nation-to-nation relationship, and want to talk about what is best for their communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530470">I have heard vague references made by some members about how they have been on a reserve or have worked on a reserve. Somehow that gives them the authority to know what is best.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530471"> Thirty-three first nations helped send me to Ottawa. What I have heard from people in my constituency, not just from the leadership but from people on the ground, is that they are still waiting for that new chapter from the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. They are still waiting for consultation and for the word of the AMC Grand Chief to be taken seriously. He said that we have to go back to the drawing board when it comes to first nations electoral reform.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530472">We in the NDP agree that changes need to be made, but this bill is not the way to do it. I could take any bill the government has put forward in the last five years related to first nations and raise similar issues and poke holes in the kind of paternalistic discourse it tries to use to divide Canadians and keep first nations at arm's-length. Unfortunately, it perpetuates the problematic relationship that sets so many first nations back. I wish the government would take on some of the serious day-to-day issues first nations people face with the same energy and passion.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3530473">Maybe government members could spend some time talking to the chiefs of the Island Lake First Nation. I would be happy to take them on a tour. We could visit houses that do not have sinks because they do not have running water. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530474">Can members imagine that, in 2013? This is their regular house. They have a counter, but where there should be a sink, there is not one because there is no running water. Guess what that means? There is also no bathroom. One has to go to an outhouse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530475">I remember visiting an elder who had mobility issues due to diabetes. In -30° weather—the way the winter gets in northern Manitoba—he has to trudge out to the outhouse, with mobility issues, because he has no indoor bathroom. This was not 50 years ago; I was there just last year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530476">I could talk about other instances, such as in communities like Gods River where the chief is extremely passionate about people in his community succeeding when it comes to education. This is a community that has grown significantly over the last number of years, and the school is so overcrowded that the science lab and home economics room have been taken over for regular classrooms. This means that these children are obviously not getting the one-on-one attention they need. It also means that these kids are not able to access specialized programming because the needed classrooms equipped to do that have been dismantled and made into regular classrooms. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530477">Often these kids see a system that has given up on them. They see their chief fighting for them, but they know that, although the chief has gone to Ottawa and Winnipeg fighting for a new school to fit their needs, year after year, that demand is denied, and many lose faith and hope. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530478">Unfortunately, in communities like Gods River, Gods Lake Narrows, Shamattawa and Pukatawagan, too many kids have gone down that path too far and have not turned back. They have committed suicide, fallen through the cracks of our society or moved to urban centres where they have been lost and have never come back. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530479">There would be an opportunity for change. It is not because their chief, their leadership, and people like the Grand Chief of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs have not said what needs to be done, but that the current federal government does not listen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530480">Not only do the Conservatives not listen, but they choose to drive an agenda that suits them. It is an agenda that sucks up wedge issues, pits people against aboriginal people in our country and tells first nations and aboriginal leadership that they do not know how to run their business. It is an agenda that fundamentally keeps us on the path of a history that has only created trouble, is based on paternalistic colonial views and has been proven wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530481">I am proud to stand with a party that seeks justice when it comes to first nations people, which is why we are opposed to Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9</Document>, and why we are opposed to so many of the first nation-related bills that the Conservative government has put forward. It is why we are asking for change, for a better future for first nation people and all Canadians.</ParaText>

When I look at the role of the federal government when it comes to the first nations people, to our aboriginal and Inuit, I think here we are in 2013, the 21st century, and we have people living in our first nation communities that absolutely bring tears to our eyes when we see the way the children live and the way the communities are surviving.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530504">I have had the privilege of visiting many first nation communities in my previous life. Every time I went to those communities, I was so impressed with the strong feeling of community, with the strong feeling of hope that something will change. These communities are asking us the biggest question of all: When will things change and get better for first nations people in many parts of Canada?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530505">Since I have been in the House, we have dealt with a lot of pretty tragic cases. Attawapiskat is a fine example. The report from the United Nations is another fine example. All of the information we have says that some urgent action needs to be taken on a whole lot of issues to address concerns with the first nations people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530506">I was pleased when I heard the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> say there would be a new way of moving forward with our first nation communities. Being a hopeful and optimistic person, that actually made me feel good. However, since I have been in the House and have heard some of my colleagues from the other side on the way our federal government is dealing with the first nations people, none of that has come to light. What we get are lots of words. Words are good because they are a first step, but it is absolutely imperative that we take the next step and the next step in order to put right wrongs that have existed for hundreds of years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530507">This is the 21st century. We are beyond colonialism, I hope. We talk about respect for our first nations, nation-to-nation relationships, moving forward nation to nation, but in reality, what we have is more paternalism, and “We might have talked with you, and we did, but we know better what will work for you”. It is that kind of paternalism that is at the root of why I am opposed to this piece of legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530508">No one is saying that we do not need to address some of the problems that exist with the Indian Act and the election provisions within it. We agree that we need to make some changes, but those changes cannot be railroaded and they cannot be imposed. Yes, consultations occur, but when the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, not just one person but the assembly, says that this is not good and this does not reflect what we said, then surely it is time to take a breather and go back to try to build consensus and to try to address the concerns that were raised.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3530510">We agree that the APC supports this. However, there is not overall support. For the government to say one group supports it and the other group does not and therefore it is going to do it anyway, it seems a little top-heavy and unnecessary. If the government had taken the time to address some of the issues, we would not have this dilemma today. If it had even accepted the amendments, we would not be here debating the bill in this way today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530511">Everyone wants to see elections fixed, or whatever they are, and to make sure things go right. We agree with that. However, we do have the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs saying this does not cut it. One of the reasons it does not cut it is that to opt-in to this scheme it just takes a vote by the council, but to opt-out is a very cumbersome affair. Surely, opting-in and opting-out should be similar mechanisms. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530512">The other thing is that we know the ministers under this government love to have more and more power centralized in the ministries, but in this, the minister could even impose a first nation to come into this system, even if it decides not to go in. That seems way over the top and totally unnecessary. Once again, what it would do is give far more power to the minister, and in that process, it would diminish the nationhood of the first nation groups that it impacts. We should really be paying attention to that. </ParaText>

All I know is that when things should be getting better, in many ways things are getting worse. Maybe things are getting worse now because we can actually see it. Because of our technologies such as television and satellites, we can actually see what is happening in some of our remote communities. I would invite my colleagues across the way not just to drop in but to actually go there and visit people's houses, not the ones that have been specially cleaned for them but visit the houses and some of the seniors and even some of the schools.

I can remember the look of excitement and anticipation on Chief Atleo's face when the minister made his speech, and I know how full of hope and optimism the first nations people were that this was a way forward. However, I would say that since then the words do not look so shiny. As a matter of fact, they have been muddied because over and over again we have not responded to the needs of the first nations people, nor has the government, despite all its words, respected that nation-to-nation way of moving forward, getting out of colonialism and out of this paternalistic type of governance, and moving into true nation-to-nation governance for our first nations. With that comes rights, and with that comes responsibilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530522">However, it is very disturbing for me when we hear some of the comments. For example, children who go to first nation schools should surely get the same dollar amount as the students who go to public schools, K to 12, in Canada. Surely when we have communities up in the north, we have to build into the budget the cost of heating and transportation. If we do not, once again that takes away from the dollars that can be used to educate our first nations' children.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3530563">A troubling feature of first nations elections on reserves is the low voter turnout. As with other Canadian and provincial elections, low turnout is problematic, and it is a sign of more complex underlying issues that need to be addressed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530564">In terms of first nations elections, New Democrats agree that there is room for improvement, but we also believe there are some significant issues with the bill. I would like to go into a few of those issues. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530565">Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9</Document>'s key provisions include an election cycle longer than two years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530566">We agree this is necessary. We support four-year election terms. With a two-year election cycle, disputes can take most of the two-year mandate to solve through the current appeals process, which lacks rigour, transparency, and procedural fairness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530567">Another provision in the bill is the ability to have a common election date. This is also a reasonable provision. The Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs has called for a single election day so that a region can standardize time spent electioneering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530568">Another provision gives the <Affiliation DbId="191408" Type="4">Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development</Affiliation> the power to order a first nation with community designed elections to adhere to the new regime. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530569">New Democrats believe Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9</Document> could allow for more effective self-government if it is limited to opt-in legislation, but the current provisions allowing the minister to determine a band's future without consultation contradict the spirit of self-government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530570">Another provision is for elections appeals through the courts, rather than through the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, and for penalties for breaking election rules. Let me speak to these. The hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170315" Type="2">Nanaimo—Cowichan</Affiliation> has spoken in this place about our concerns with these two provisions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530571">This act would not specifically allow for either an independent tribunal or an electoral commission, similar to what federal and provincial governments have in place. In this legislation, disputes would have to be resolved in the courts. This requirement could mean increased legal costs for first nations, which already tend to be cash-strapped. Why did the government not consider an independent body that would oversee disputes, as was recommended by the Senate, as well as by the joint ministerial advisory committee's report?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530572">I would like to turn to consultations now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530573">As I said before, New Democrats want to see first nation elections improved, but this legislation would not amend the Indian Act where some of the most egregious powers of the minister reside.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530574">What concerns me most about the bill is the government's approach to its relationship with first nations. The process seemed to start out relatively well, in terms of the AMC and the APC holding regional round tables on how to improve the elections process. Then, with the support of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, consultations were held on developing new opt-in legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530575">However, as the bill was developed, it seems the government's willingness to work together with others waned. The government had an opportunity to create this legislation in consultation with first nations, but instead it ignored recommendations it received and has refused to make amendments to the bill that were requested by first nations.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="30">(1330)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3530576">The concept of consultation has been disregarded time and time again by the government. Where is the government's commitment to working in consultation with first nations and ensuring consent before legislation is unilaterally imposed? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530577">This strikes me as very similar to some of the issues I worked on in my capacity as deputy critic for Fisheries and Oceans. When the government's omnibus budget bills were introduced, there was much concern over the gutting of habitat protection legislation, as well as a unilateral change to the definition of the term “aboriginal fishery”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530578">We talked to the government, which insisted it had consulted with first nations on these massive changes, but when we talked to first nations, it was clear that the government's view of the term “consultations” is very different from how anyone else would define that term. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530579">One would think “consultations” would mean a somewhat rigorous process whereby input is legitimately sought and incorporated, or at the very least valued, in the decision-making process. However, what I heard was that these consultations often just meant a brief meeting at which government officials informed stakeholder groups of their plans. It was very one-sided. There was no real effort made to gather input, let alone to reflect this input in the final outcome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530580">The result of this approach is troubling, and we see it with the bill before us today. Without proper consultation, there is a serious lack of buy-in on the final product, in this case Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9</Document>. It means complexities and potential issues in proposed legislation are not fully fleshed out. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530581">I, for one, was not surprised to hear the government's legal bills have soared to exorbitant levels over the past few years. The government has made massive changes to dozens of pieces of legislation, and its approach has tended to be unilateral in terms of lack of consultation and lack of proper debate and review in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530582">We have seen dozens upon dozens of time allocation motions. We see that government-controlled committees refuse to incorporate reasonable amendments to problematic legislation, and then they go in camera so that there is not even a public record of their shenanigans. I would prefer that bills be given thorough study and due process so that hopefully the government can avoid these exorbitant legal costs to fix their mistakes. In terms of the omnibus budget bills, the lack of meaningful consultation with first nations was a key driver in the Idle No More protests across the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530583">In conclusion, the Conservative government has promised a new relationship with Canada's first nations, but it is all talk and no action. At every turn, the government prefers to impose legislation without truly consulting with first nations first. First nations have the right to be involved in and consulted on every decision that affects them. The government should work with first nations to solve the problems they are confronting instead of always resorting to knee-jerk paternalism. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530584">I would like to thank the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170315" Type="2">Nanaimo—Cowichan</Affiliation> as well as her hard-working staff, who put a lot of effort into understanding this bill and its various propositions and provisions. I would like to thank as well the official opposition critic for aboriginal affairs. She has done an amazing job over the years. My hat is off to her and to her critique of this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530585">While there are a number of good provisions and goals in this legislation before us today, I cannot, in good faith, vote in support of this bill at third reading.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3530601">Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to rise to speak to Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9</Document>, for several reasons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530602">Twenty years ago, I was in Vienna for the World Conference on Human Rights. I am proud to say that I was thrown out of the Vienna conference centre because I dared to stand up for something that was important to me, and that was the recognition of aboriginal peoples as peoples, just like all other peoples on the planet. I had a poster with a big “S” on it because I was insisting that people call us “indigenous peoples” instead of “indigenous populations”. I hope the same thing will not happen in this august chamber if I stress certain points today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530603">I would first like to address a number of aspects of this bill that really fascinate me, because there are several aspects of the government's behaviour that I find completely ambiguous. Everyone is supposed to understand that aboriginal peoples are the only distinct group mentioned in the Canadian Constitution and the only one that is referred to separately. In that regard, I think the Constitution should allow a nation-to-nation relationship with those peoples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530604">However, that is not the case with this government. This government is not taking action on these relationships, which should have taken on a new scope in January 2012. The way this Conservative government treats the first peoples in this country is certainly not the way partners of Confederation should be treated. There is a problem across the way with relations with aboriginal peoples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530605">I mentioned the fight to get recognition for aboriginal peoples as peoples, which took several years to accomplish. Today, I can also tell you that it took us 23 years of discussions, negotiations and drafting to create the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Those 23 years of negotiation took a lot of energy, effort and emotion because it is never easy to work multilaterally, as was the case for those negotiations. It took 23 years to create that declaration, which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in September 2007.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530606">I am proud to have been personally involved in this process, even though it took a very long time. We are used to that. For aboriginals, patience is in our genes, in a way. Sometimes we do not have the choice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530607">Sometimes we do have the choice though. Article 3 of the declaration I just mentioned establishes the right of indigenous peoples to self-determination. I mention it because the basic right to self-determination belongs to all people, this right to freely determine their political status. The word "freely" is important here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530608">Yet that is not what we have here today. This bill goes against the spirit of self-government that aboriginal peoples should be afforded. It is not in this bill.</ParaText>

                <CommitteeQuote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">My main objection to this bill is the lack of positive change from the old Indian Act. Neither the Indian Act nor Bill [C-9] incorporate the constitutional principles of the inherent right to self-determination and governance. The authority in this bill remains with the cabinet and the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada instead of moving towards a greater responsibility with First Nations for our governance.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="3530613">Today we are celebrating the life of the great Nelson Mandela. He got rid of a system that had no place on this planet, namely apartheid. While his life is being celebrated, what are we doing here? We are trying to improve a system that does not work. Those are the parliamentary secretary's words. I think that apartheid was largely inspired by the Indian Act and the way aboriginal people were treated in this country. That is an issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530614">In my opinion, another worrisome aspect is the government's lack of willingness to listen to first nations. I want to stress that, because when aboriginal peoples speak of consultation, they are not indulging in political whims. I said that to the House as recently as last week. Calling for consultation is not just a political whim. It is a constitutional duty to consult with first nations and accommodate the concerns expressed during that consultation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530615">The government has a dual responsibility, a dual constitutional duty concerning aboriginal peoples; however, it seems to have forgotten that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530616">I am always surprised to see that this government does not seem to want to take the path of partnership and co-operation with aboriginal peoples. There is a need for mutual respect. The aboriginal peoples are the original partners of Confederation. It is important to constantly remember that. The government should have really consulted with and listened to the first nations. Changes to this bill have been proposed by a number of aboriginal groups across the country. The intent behind the bill is right, but people have proposed changes and amendments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530617">It is important to always remember that we have the constitutional obligation to consult and accommodate aboriginal peoples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530618">I have participated in negotiations with the government for many years. That is the only way to move forward with aboriginal peoples. We are certainly not going to accomplish anything by excluding first nations from the table or from discussions.</ParaText>

The people of Laval are generous. Last year, over a million kilograms of food were distributed to Laval residents in need. This was made possible in part by the work of hundreds of volunteers. I would like to thank them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530680">Congratulations to the Centre de bénévolat et moisson Laval for its hard work and its dedication to this cause in these difficult times. We all want a society where nobody is left behind, which unfortunately is not the case right now. However, we will not lose hope and we will continue to fight together every day to eliminate inequities.</ParaText>

For some Canadian families, however, it can be a time of exceptional hardship. Thankfully, charities like the United Way are there to provide some relief. Our government recognizes the important work that charities do for our communities, and we want to ensure we do all we can to encourage charitable giving.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530682"> In 2012, tax relief from charitable donations was over $2.98 billion. We want to see that number grow. That is why in economic action plan 2013, our government proudly introduced the first-time donor super credit. This provides an additional 25% to first-time donors, in addition to existing federal and provincial credits. Our government will always be there to support the work of charities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3530902">This is yet another bill that is being brought forward to tinker with the highly problematic Indian Act. It comes at a time where the breach in relationship between the Government of Canada, the Crown, and first nations across this country is at a very stark moment in our Canadian history, where government seems to believe that it can move back toward a colonial relationship with the first peoples of this country and that it is in the power of the minister to make decisions that really belong in communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530903">There are elements in the bill about tinkering with the problems of the elections act, which we have seen. There are elements in the bill about trying to alleviate some of the problems we have seen with the Indian Act, but the fundamental problem is the breach of trust in relationship that is not being done with the communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530904">Once again, it is Ottawa, the Department of Indian Affairs, imposing upon the people themselves how situations are going to be resolved, rather than recognizing that in the 21st century it is not acceptable to treat an entire section of our Canadian population, basically, as a hostage people under a bureaucracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530905">As we speak, in my communities we are now in probably the 15th state of emergency that I have seen in the James Bay region, due to chronic infrastructure and failed government plans for basic health and safety and housing. We have 70 people who were burnt out of a construction trailer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530906">For the people back home to understand what this is, this is not living quarters. This is a bunkhouse that was brought in on an emergency basis after a 2008 infrastructure collapse in Attawapiskat, where the sewage system failed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530907">Now, most people in Canada have no concept of how a municipal infrastructure like sewage would fail, but in each one of my communities on James Bay, I have seen the complete collapse of sewage or water from underfunding, from poorly planned projects: Fort Albany, a complete collapse of infrastructure in the winter of 2009; Kashechewan, in 2005-06, an entire evacuation of 2,000 people; Attawapiskat, in 2008 and again in 2011.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530908">In 2008, when the sewage backed up and destroyed numerous houses in Attawapiskat, the community called upon the federal government for help. Here is what the federal government did. It just said, “You're on your own”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530909">We talk about the financial problems in these communities. It was the communities themselves that were forced to evacuate 80 people to accommodations in Cochrane and pay for hotels for months on end at the expense of the band, which put the band seriously in debt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530910">We just had a report from the Auditor General on the complete failure of basic safety protocols from the federal government, that the government sets aside $19 million to deal with emergencies across Canada, whether they be fire, flood or other needs for evacuation, when what it spent in 2009-10 was $286 million; $180 million of that went on response and recovery, but only $4 million went toward prevention and mitigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530911">That means that it had to take money from building schools, it had to take money from safe water, it had to take money from building houses to deal with whatever the emergency was at the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530912">I want to put this in context. There is not a single non-native community in this country to which, if there were a fire, the government would turn around and say, ”Well, guess what? There are no more schools in your district for the next five years”. It would say, “We're not building you a hospital. You know why? Because you people ended up getting flooded out”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530913">We saw the incredible response in High River and Calgary, from across Canada. The federal government and the provincial government helped the residents there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530914">However, when our communities are flooded out, we see the derision and the abuse from the trolls all over the main media sites blaming the people, laughing at the people for being the victims of a natural disaster, and we see the government choosing to ignore them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530915">This destabilizes band councils in their ability to deal with the developments in our communities because they are always having to try to find money to deal with the fundamental problem, which is the failed infrastructure.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="10">(1510)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3530916">While we are talking in the House about this government-imposed bill that has not been done with proper consultations, I want to also speak about the deep sense of broken trust that exists with first nations communities and this government—in particular, the abuse of the aboriginal residential school apology. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530917">It was the proudest moment of my life as a parliamentarian to stand in the House and see the Government of Canada acknowledge what had been done in the residential schools. Since that proud day, I have seen systematic attack on the survivors of these institutions by the federal government—in particular, the victims who survived St. Anne's residential school. In the long histories of abuse and degradation that happened in the residential schools, St. Anne's stands out as a particularly dark and brutal story. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530918">In 1992, the Ontario Provincial Police launched an investigation into the abuse that went on at St. Anne's. It was probably the largest police investigation into child torture and abuse of its kind outside of Mount Cashel. More than 900 witness statements were gathered. Thousands of pages of documents were subpoenaed and obtained from the Catholic Church in Montreal and Moose Factory. The OPP did an extraordinary job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530919">Survivors of St. Anne's finally came forward to be part of the independent assessment process, which the government had set up. It told the people who survived this brutal institution that, if they came forward and told their stories, it would work this out with them. The legal responsibility of the federal government at that time, laid out in the terms of agreement under the independent assessment process schedule D, appendix VIII and appendix X, was that the federal government would provide a narrative, a written record of all the known documentation of abuse that occurred at St. Anne's. The federal government, though, chose not to tell any of the survivors, or their legal teams or their adjudicators about the thousands of pages of police evidence that the federal government was aware of, thereby undermining and compromising the independent assessment process. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530920">I wrote to the <Affiliation DbId="191408" Type="4">Minister of Aboriginal Affairs</Affiliation> about this breach, because this is serious. The obligation to disclose evidence is a fundamental principle of justice. The minister wrote on July 17: “Canada is, of course, aware of the Ontario Provincial Police investigations regarding St. Anne's Indian Residential School and the resulting...trials”. However, he said that it was not their job to obtain this evidence and it certainly was not their responsibility to tell the survivors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530921">He also claimed that the evidence was not even admissible. He said: “...statements made to the Ontario Provincial Police in the course of investigations...cannot...be used as evidence in the Independent Assessment Process. ...only the oral testimony of a witness is considered evidence”. He then referred me to page 10, paragraph 10, of the terms of agreement. I read that and it says nothing of the kind. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530922">I have the <Affiliation DbId="191408" Type="4">Minister of Aboriginal Affairs</Affiliation> putting on record something that is completely false, regarding the withholding of evidence about the abuse and torture of children. In fact, the terms of agreement of the independent assessment process says the exact opposite to what the minister is claiming. It says “...findings in previous criminal or civil trials...may be accepted...without further proof”. This is the key issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530923">The poor survivors who chose to come forward. However, I know many in our communities in Fort Albany, Moose Factory, Attawapiskat and Peawanuck who have not participated in the independent assessment process because they could not bear the trauma of being challenged and having to go through the process again. Yet, the government knew. All the evidence was there, particularly evidence that the administrators of the school built an electric chair to electrocute children, for the kicks of staff. That was in the police affidavit. The survivors coming forward would have to tell this, only to be challenged by federal lawyers who would say that it is not true or not admissible. This is the real key of the breach of trust that shows the dark, dark heart of this government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530924">When the issue of the fact that it had suppressed evidence and compromised the truth and reconciliation process was brought out and exposed, the government admitted that it needed to deal with this at the Ontario Superior Court. Next Tuesday, December 17, this issue will be addressed at Ontario Superior Court. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="15">(1515)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3530925">What we have found out since the July 17 letter from the <Affiliation DbId="191408" Type="4">Minister of Aboriginal Affairs</Affiliation> is that the federal government had this evidence all along. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530926">The federal government went to Ontario court in 2003 and demanded access to all of the police evidence. The government was not doing that on behalf of the victims. It said that it was its right, as the defendant and the entity responsible for the abuse of these children, to access the thousands of pages of police testimony and the 900-some witness documents about the abuse that was perpetrated against the children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530927">In 2003, the federal government got that evidence. In his 2003 decision, Justice Trainor said that this evidence was to be used and should be used by future plaintiffs. However, the future plaintiffs were not told that. They were lied to in the legal process that they participated in. The evidence was suppressed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530928">This is a very serious breach of fiduciary and legal obligations. The federal government acts as the defendant in this case against the abuse of these children, but it also acts, under the obligation of the independent assessment process, to provide all the evidence so that it can be adjudicated by the legal teams. The government decided to suppress this evidence and say that it did not know where it was or have access to it. The government even tried to claim privacy right provisions to prevent the survivors from seeing it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530929">The people that I represent in our communities still live with the abuse that went on at St. Anne's. There is not a family I have met who is not still trying to put the pieces back together from the intergenerational damage that was done and the outright attempt to destroy the James Bay people through this horrific institution. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530930">The federal government knew the extent of the abuse. It knew the number of perpetrators of the abuse. It sat on it and it told the survivors who came before a legal process that there was no evidence to back up their claims. When I go home to James Bay and to see the survivors in Fort Albany, I really do not know what to tell them about a government that could be that mercenary and cold-blooded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530931">When the Conservative government comes forward with its colonial attitude about first nations education and its spin and misinformation and attacks on the leadership in these communities, and its blame about it being a big waste on the taxpayers, the communities that I represent know that the Conservative government is one that has not shown any good faith toward them. They know that the Conservative government is one that has breached the fundamental promise that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> made when he stood up and talked to the survivors about the residential schools. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530932">That system was set up to destroy the Indian in the child. Under Duncan Scott, going back, it was meant to eradicate a people. The Conservative government is continuing on a process of treating the survivors, the grandchildren and the great-grandchildren who suffered under this system, in a manner that is abusive and fails to show respect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530933">We could continue to talk about tinkering with the Indian Act. We could talk about long-term goals, but I have never heard any long-term goals from the government when it comes to first nations. Otherwise, we could say that something fundamentally wrong happened when the treaties were breached and the children were sent off to the residential schools. It is up to the House of the common people of Canada to repair that breach. We need to do it by moving away from the abusive, uninterested, arrogant, and incompetent attitude of this government when it comes to first nations communities, first nations governance, and first nations children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530934">Right now, the <Affiliation DbId="191408" Type="4">Minister of Aboriginal Affairs</Affiliation> has his first nations education act. I have never seen a man have to run so fast from legislation that he said was going to be a great benefit to all first nations children. He is having to run from it because the government has not consulted with the communities. It is again attempting to impose a model that no other community in this country would allow.</ParaText>

The government believes that it can bring in some edicts and change things, but the government does not understand that the <Affiliation DbId="191408" Type="4">Minister of Aboriginal Affairs</Affiliation> is de facto the education minister of one of the largest school populations in this country.</ParaText>

He cannot tell us the per person cost of educating a child under his watch. That level of negligence is astounding, because we are talking about children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530937">The threat the government is making now on the first nation education act is that it is going to put a little money on the table, and either everyone plays ball or it will take the money away. It has the attitude that it can dangle a carrot in front of communities that have substandard education. There are communities in my riding like Attawapiskat where, after 13, 14, 15 years, they may finally get a school. In Kashechewan in my riding, grade school still does not exist. I can name communities across this country where the schools have been condemned for years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530938">The government is offering to put a little money on the table, and then people will either do what the government tells them to do or it will take the money away. One has to ask what kind of government would use children as bargaining chips. We used to hear the minister say that the government gives more money to first nation children than the provincial system, but of course he was laughed out of the room for that one, so now he is saying the government will provide a little money and people will come along or it will pull the whole project.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530939">I asked what kind of government would use children as bargaining chips. I remember when the federal government imposed a third-party manager on the band in Attawapiskat in 2011-2012. It thought the community would fold, but the community did not fold, and they went to court. When they went to court, the government cut off all the funding to the community, including for education, and the community went two months without education dollars. That would be illegal in any other jurisdiction. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530940">There have been many fights with municipal governments, but imagine a fight with the municipal government in Toronto if it were told the money is going to be cuff off to all the schools until it complies with its mayor. That would never happen, but that is what happened in Attawapiskat. The government imposed a third-party manager at $1,800 a day, who I think was making more money than the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, yet students were being evicted from college because the money was not being transferred for their college funds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530941">There are some fundamental problems with the relationship, and I would like to tell my hon. colleagues that it does not have to be this way. When I look at first nation communities across this country, I see such immense possibilities. I see inspired young people coming forward as leaders. On the James Bay coast I have seen a whole new generation of young, articulate leaders who see a much bigger world and want to be part of that world. I see industry saying it wants to find ways to get peace on the ground so development can occur, saying that for development to happen, it needs trained, empowered first nation communities, but I do not see the federal government at the table.</ParaText>

The signing of the James Bay agreement with the Grand Council of the Crees was a historic moment. The Government of Quebec recognized that it had to deal with the land issues of the James Bay Cree. It set the first modern treaty, but it was with a provincial government, because the feds were not at the table. We can see from that model that when something is done with respect and involvement, change is possible.</ParaText>

That is not to say that it has been easy. It is not to say that the treaty principles of La Paix des Braves have not been breached, but there is a mechanism in place.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3530981">I rise at third reading to speak against Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9</Document>, which has a very long title, and to demonstrate that I have actually read it, I am going to go through the title. It is An Act respecting the election and term of office of chiefs and councillors of certain First Nations and the composition of council of those First Nations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530982">I am always a bit resentful when members on the other side imply that disagreement means that we have not actually read a bill. In fact, I am disappointed to be in this situation of opposing this bill, because there was actually a promising start with some first nations in terms of trying to come up with a bill to reform the regulations under the Indian Act for conducting elections. However, somewhere this went off the rails, I believe. It is also disappointing because we have been discussing these kinds of issues of governance for a long time. I want to spend some time on how we got here, or more accurately, on how we are stalled at the place where we are now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530983">When I said I wanted to talk about how we got here or about how we are stalled here, I am really referring to the broad underlying issue of first nations self-government. This is a principle that was first recognized by this Parliament more than 30 years ago, when all parties agreed to support what was called the Penner report, in 1983. This report was named after the chair of what was called the Indian self-government committee. This was an exceptional committee in the House of Commons in that it invited a first nations representative, Roberta Jamieson, a very respected Mohawk leader, to sit as a full member of the committee. It was certainly the first and perhaps the only time any committee of this House of Commons has had someone from outside the House sit on a committee. The reason for doing that was that we wanted to make sure that first nations were heard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530984"> The committee travelled the length and breadth of this country, literally from coast to coast to coast, to hear directly from first nations and their communities. I know about this committee quite well, because as a young researcher at the House of Commons, I was actually attached as staff to the committee, and I travelled across the country for nearly a year with the committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530985">What the Penner report did was groundbreaking in what it recommended and in that it actually listened to first nations in their communities. In adopting the Penner committee report, the House of Commons broke new ground, because the House of Commons said that Canadians needed to recognize the right of self-government for first nations and needed to entrench that right in the Constitution. Then there needed to be legislation to implement self-government by recognizing first nations as a third order of government, independent of federal and provincial governments, in their own areas of jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530986"> This marks a journey that began 30 years ago to make first nations self-government a reality in this country, and unfortunately, Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9</Document> indicates that we still have not gotten there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530987">The new approach taken by the Penner committee was entrenched in the Constitution Act, 1982, which recognized and affirmed existing aboriginal rights and treaty rights and provided for constitutional conferences to be held later to define and implement those rights. Unfortunately, in the four conferences held between 1983 and 1987, there was a failure to get agreement on how to define those rights and on how to move forward with legislation to implement them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530988">The year 1987 marked the biggest setback for the recognition of self-government we have seen in this country, with the failure of that constitutional conference on self-government and with the exclusion of aboriginal people from the talks leading to the Meech Lake accord. Of course, fate sometimes has a way of paying back, so when it came time for the Meech Lake accord to be approved, it failed. It was defeated in the Manitoba legislature by a single vote, that of the respected first nations leader Elijah Harper.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530989">There was an attempt to reset the debate at Charlottetown, and aboriginal people were included in that next round of constitutional talks. The Charlottetown accord would have explicitly entrenched the right of self-government in the Constitution, but it was subsequently, unfortunately, defeated at referendum.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530990">I am going to continue just a little longer down this road of talking about history, because it explains what is fundamentally wrong with Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9</Document>, as it is presented to us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530991">In 1996, we had the publication of the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, which echoed what had been said in the original Penner report, now some 13 years before. It said again that we needed to recognize and entrench the right to self-government; to recognize first nations governments as a third order of government, equal in every way to federal and provincial governments; and to reorganize our federal institutions to reflect those facts.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="45">(1545)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3530992">Unfortunately, the response of the Liberal government in 1998 was simply that they were open to talking. The Liberals did not actually do anything to implement those recommendations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530993">Alongside this halting political process, there were important legal developments based on the recognition of aboriginal rights in the 1982 Constitution. This refers to the Supreme Court of Canada decisions, beginning with R. v. Sparrow in 1990, which established that the federal government has a duty to consult and to accommodate first nations when considering any infringement or abridgement of an aboriginal treaty right. The Supreme Court of Canada has found this duty to flow not only from section 35.1 of the Constitution Act but also from the fiduciary responsibilities of the Crown to aboriginal people and from the duty to uphold the honour of the Crown by dealing with aboriginal people in a fair and just manner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530994">Returning to Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9</Document> directly, no one argues that the election process under the Indian Act could not be improved, but there are two much more important questions at play here. How does Bill C-9 stack up when it comes to these two constitutional principles governing relationships between the federal government and first nations: the recognition of the right of self-government on the one hand and the duty to consult on the other? I submit that on both grounds, the bill fails and fails miserably.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530995">Consultation means more than just asking people to speak and then ignoring their concerns. Again, a process that started well with the first nations in the Atlantic provinces and with the Manitoba chiefs went off the rails when people raised concerns about particular aspects of the bill. The government decided to press ahead, despite losing the support of its partner in those consultations. This is not what consultation means in Canadian law. Consultation means to hear the other side, to take seriously their concerns, and to accommodate those concerns when it comes to first nations' rights. This has not been done in the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530996">Respect for self-government also means that we recognize first nations governments as equals in the constitutional order. What is fundamentally wrong with the bill, and what first nations object to, is giving the minister the right to decide which kind of election first nations should use. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530997">The bill would allow even those using custom elections to be forced under the provisions of this new parallel process, even over the objections of that first nation. If the minister believed there was something wrong in the first nation in terms of corruption or the election process, the minister could unilaterally decide to force them into a selection process for their leaders that they did not choose. This fundamentally disrespects the right to self-government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530998">I have five first nations in my riding. Elections in four of those are conducted under the Indian Act. The Songhees Nation, Scia'new First Nation, T'Sou-ke Nation, and Pacheedaht First Nation are running under what, admittedly, is an act with some problems, in particular the two-year term for leaders. However, they were not consulted directly and have not asked for these changes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3530999">One of the nations in my riding, Esquimalt Nation, operates under custom, and certainly Esquimalt has not been consulted and would object strenuously to giving the minister the power to force them away from their customary elections.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531000">First nations in my riding should be concerned about that lack of consultation, but they are even more concerned about the lack of respect for first nations as equal partners in Confederation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531001">Unfortunately, the <Affiliation DbId="191408" Type="4">Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development</Affiliation> confirmed earlier today in the House the bullying attitude of the Conservatives when it comes to first nations by restating his position, once again, that he will not discuss funding for first nations education unless they first agree to accept his bill to reform first nations education. Again, it is fundamental disrespect for consultation and fundamental disrespect for the equality of first nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531002">I see that I am running out of time. Let me say that in my riding, certainly, we have no problem with the leadership of first nations. We have a large number of initiatives that have been undertaken by chiefs in our ridings, including Chief Rob Sam, of the Songhees Nation, which is about to open a wellness centre; Chief Andy Thomas, of Esquimalt Nation, which has entered a partnership for apprenticeships in the shipbuilding industry; Chief Russell Chipps, who is in a partnership to build a new housing development on the Scia'new Reserve; and Chief Gordon Planes, who has led his nation in becoming a solar nation, according to a division of his elders, and has taken the first nation off the grid, with solar hot water in every nation and solar cells on the first nations office roof. It is certainly a great initiative. The Pacheedaht Nation, under Chief McClurg, recently purchased a tree farm licence to provide sustainable care of the forest and sustainable economic development in his community.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531005">As for the Esquimalt Nation, which operates under custom code, the minister currently has the power under the Indian Act to take it out of custom code and put it into the Indian Act code if it has a prolonged dispute. That power currently exists. It is not a new idea.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531006">What this legislation proposes is that the minister would be able to, in extreme circumstances, put them into the more robust system proposed under Bill <Document DbId="6266869" Type="3">C-9</Document>. The current rules have only been exercised three times in Canada's history, when a first nation has been taken out of custom code election and put back into the Indian Act because of a prolonged dispute. On those extremely rare occasion where a first nation has been unable to internally resolve a leadership problem, Bill C-9 would allow it to be put into this more robust system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531007">This is not a new power. The member should know that. If he paid attention to the debate and what was discussed in committee, he would know that this is the case. It has only been done three times. I wish he would recognize that fact.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531010">Again, it illustrates my point exactly, that true consultation means hearing the other side and what it has to say and making a legitimate effort to include those suggestions in the bill.

              <ParaText id="3531023">Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his chairmanship on the finance committee. We have had a very busy agenda this fall. Our pre-budget consultations are very important because we are still dealing with the after-effects of the most severe economic downturn since the Great Depression. We have heard from many Canadians who expect us to work together to make life more affordable, to help them in their retirement and create good middle-class jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531024">The majority report contains important summaries of the testimonies from many excellent witnesses. However, it fails to present comprehensive solutions to the important issues raised in the hearings. We need solutions like good middle-class jobs that have continued to disappear under the government. We need concrete measures to help people save for their retirement years. We also heard concerns about the process of this consultation, that the restrictions placed on consultations were too narrow and restrictive. We heard that from witnesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531025">We also heard concerns about the lack of transparency and accountability for the budget process as a whole. We have called on the federal government to introduce more transparency in the budget process, as recommended by the Parliamentary Budget Officer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531026">In our supplementary report, we have submitted a number of proposals about the creation of good jobs, investments in infrastructure, the need to save and invest in retirement security for Canadians. Sadly, the government just voted against making improvements to CPP and QPP yesterday. We also made recommendations about making life more affordable for Canadians, how to address the issue of household debt and about improving the programs and services that Canadians rely on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531027">We believe these concrete measures should have been included in the main body of the report and that did not meet the approval of the government. While the other opposition party was supportive in defining the problem again, we found a lack of concrete solutions in many cases. We believe our supplementary report presents a fuller picture and concrete recommendations that we hope will help the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> in his deliberations for the budget of 2014.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531031">The report on income inequality in Canada is unfortunately all too brief. There is a disturbing growth in income inequality in Canada over recent decades. We heard stark testimony about the social and economic ills associated with it, but we had a mere three public hearings on such a huge topic. It was also very limited in scope. We believe that on both these grounds, the limited time and the limited scope, were grossly inadequate to address the fundamental problems facing Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531032">The report successfully details many of the key elements of the inequality problem. We believe the recommendations of the report fail to fully confront the problem that we are facing, so we had a whole range of supplementary recommendations, things like calling for a thorough review of Canada's tax and transfer system to see where the greatest increases in income inequality are located, and we urge that the government review all tax expenditure to assess their cost effectiveness and fairness. We also urge the government to really crack down on tax evasion and go after that revenue, which is badly needed for our economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531033">We had strong recommendations about retirement security, improving OAS, reversing the cuts that the government made, improving GIS and improving the Canada and Quebec pension plan, expanding the working income tax benefit and increasing the federal minimum wage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531034">We also called for stronger measures to allow people to engage in collective bargaining, which we believe would improve their working lives and their incomes, so we had a range of concrete recommendations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531035">We believe income inequality is not only a terrible personal and social ill, it has an impact on our overall economy. It is bad for economic growth and we believe strongly that with the concrete measures we are proposing, Canada can marshal the resources to address this serious and urgent problem, and growing problem, and that we should be doing this without delay.</ParaText>

According to the AFN, if there is one aspect of the inherent right to self-government that we can all agree on, and that must absolutely be constitutionally protected under section 35 of the Constitution Act, it must be the ability of our nations to determine their own method of selecting leadership. Otherwise, section 35 is meaningless. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531059">In addition, a number of witnesses who appeared before the committee pointed out that the system the department is proposing is too complex. Candice Paul, co-chair of the Atlantic Policy Conference of First Nations Chiefs, had concerns about a number of aspects of the proposed electoral system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531060">Ms. Paul had questions, for example, about the mandate of band councils elected under the Indian Act. First nations communities are almost constantly in an election campaign, which is detrimental to the stability of band councils and their ability to develop long-term projects. She was concerned about the weakness of the nomination process, which could result in a large number of candidates—sometimes more than 100—running in the same election. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531061">She also questioned the postal ballot system, which may be open to fraud. The process of appeal to the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development is paternalistic and complex, and it sometimes takes too long to come to conclusions and to issue binding decisions. Finally, the lack of specific election offences and associated penalties in the Indian Act leaves the door open to fraud, as well as to other illicit activities, such as buying and selling votes. </ParaText>

The chief of the Lac La Ronge Indian Band took exception to the fact that she had only a few days in which to prepare for the hearing that took place in February 2012.

              <ParaText id="3531075">We currently have a situation where a member took action. I am not sure whether it was in a consultation with first nations in his area. However, there is a big difference between a case-specific situation, where a representation is made by a member with regard to a local situation that may cause problems, and a situation enshrined in law, which gives the minister power to make a decision that affects an entire community, with little or no consultation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531076">In this particular case, I assume there was consultation. If not, I assume it was, at very least, a local situation, which required the minister to make a local decision that did not apply to the entire country. Right now, we are having a debate.

Their opposition was made clear in committee and also in the public arena. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531085"> The definition of paternalistic legislation is when the government is aware of the problems caused by a bill that should be prepared in consultation and in co-operation with the first nations and still tries to pass it without the agreement of the first nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531086"> I hope that the government will respect the meaning of real consultation and take into account the various issues raised by the first nations.

              <ParaText id="3531100">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="6254809" Type="3">C-3, An Act to enact the Aviation Industry Indemnity Act, to amend the Aeronautics Act, the Canada Marine Act, the Marine Liability Act and the Canada Shipping Act, 2001 and to make consequential amendments to other Acts</Document>. That is not my introduction. It is simply the title of the bill, which amends a number of things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531101">First, I would like to point out that Bill <Document DbId="6254809" Type="3">C-3</Document> has already been debated in another form, as Bill <Document DbId="6038237" Type="3">C-57</Document>. Before supporting that bill at second reading, the NDP asked that it be reviewed to broaden its scope and reverse Conservative cutbacks and closures regarding marine safety and the negative changes to environmental protection. Those topics directly concern the purpose of the bill. That request was refused—no surprise there—but the NDP still moved forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531102">I am speaking to this bill today to indicate why I will support it, what reservations I have, and what additional measures I would like to see in order to ensure true protection, much more extensive protection of what this bill is designed to protect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531103">As I said in my introduction, this bill changes a number of things. I would like to highlight some that I find most important. First, the bill seeks to indemnify air carriers for damage caused by war risks. The intent is simply to make sure that, in dangerous situations, air transportation can continue, come what may. It is quite interesting. The bill also grants powers to investigate aviation incidents or accidents involving civilians, aircraft and aeronautical installations. Put simply, the power of investigation increases when an accident occurs, and that too is very interesting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531104">The only reservation I have about this measure in Bill <Document DbId="6254809" Type="3">C-3</Document>—and I hope I will be able to deal with it in committee after this vote at second reading—pertains to the discretionary power being given to the minister. I want to make sure that he is not given too much.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531105">Let me digress a little. As the critic for citizenship and immigration, I have a good deal to say about the discretionary powers that are increasingly being given to ministers in a number of bills, including this one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531106">In our immigration system, we have seen a number of amendments in bills that have changed the system and given more and more discretionary power to the minister. I find that worrisome. We have a very complex and elaborate system, with very competent officials. Yet the minister is being given more and more discretionary power. That worries me. I am not pointing the finger at any minister in particular. I am simply talking about a principle that opens the door to decisions being made in back rooms, where we have no ability to seek real accountability or point out where mistakes have been made here or there. That is the end of my digression. Making that point made me feel a lot better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531107">In short, the clause in Bill <Document DbId="6254809" Type="3">C-3</Document> that deals with the Aeronautics Act must be examined closely to make sure that the discretionary powers given to the minister do not go too far. I hope that we will hear from a number of people who can give us the benefit of their wise counsel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531108">Bill <Document DbId="6254809" Type="3">C-3</Document> also proposes to amend the Marine Liability Act. The bill seeks to implement an international convention that Canada signed in 2010, the Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea. Canada is a signatory to this very important international convention and today's bill seeks to implement it. The convention defines the liability of vessel owners for the costs incurred when oil or other similar materials are spilled. It is very important to highlight and clarify the liability of companies and vessel owners when a spill like that occurs and when damage is caused.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3531109">Finally, the amendment to the Canada Shipping Act, 2001, is also very important. It introduces new requirements for operators of oil handling facilities, which is somewhat along the same lines as the amendment I mentioned earlier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531110">The amendment also proposes the application of new measures and monetary sanctions, with new investigative powers for Transport Canada investigators. Once again, we see the same idea. Those two amendments are the most important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531111">As another aside, I would like to refer to what happened recently in Lac-Mégantic. I agree that it is not really the same thing, but we are still talking about the same principle of owners and operators being liable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531112">After the recent Lac-Mégantic tragedy, we saw how the province took action. People on the ground and Quebeckers from across the province joined forces to provide assistance to victims and to raise funds for reconstruction and restitution after this oil-related accident.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531113"> It is unacceptable that it is the people who must come together and pay for that damage. People were kept in the dark for so long before finding out whether the company's insurance was going to pay for the damage. In the end, a large part of the cost had to be covered by the province and by generous and compassionate individuals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531114"> That is the link I want to make here. These amendments to the Canada Shipping Act, 2001 and the Marine Liability Act may provide a solution by ensuring that companies at fault in the case of spills or catastrophes like that one will be a little more liable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531115"> I will now continue with the bill. I said earlier that Canada was a signatory to the 2010 International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea. Yes, I said the 2010 Convention. Well, not so long ago, in the autumn of 2012, two big transport ships sank off the west coast because of the current traffic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531116"> Today, we have the impression that the bill that we are debating is a means for the Conservative government to apologize for its failure to act all these years. By signing the 2010 international convention, perhaps the government was demonstrating goodwill, but too much time went by after that. Catastrophes happened, and spills happened on the west coast, and it is only now that I am debating this bill at second reading. That is much too long. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531117"> Yes, Bill <Document DbId="6254809" Type="3">C-3</Document> introduces corrective measures, and once again I will be supporting it at second reading. It may be too little, too late, but I just wanted to raise the matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531118"> What will the next step be? The Conservatives have set up a three-person tanker safety expert panel. In November 2013, the panel was to publish a report on how to reform the oil spill response regime. I am mentioning it because all too often we have seen very interesting reports being tabled without their recommendations being taken seriously or implemented quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531119"> I hope the Conservatives will show good faith when this report is tabled and that they will implement meaningful and serious reform measures as recommended by the panel, in order to improve companies’ safety and liability. Oil tanker traffic is increasing and we must ensure that our regulations keep up. </ParaText>

Despite Bill <Document DbId="6254809" Type="3">C-3</Document> before us today, we are aware to what extent the Conservatives have gutted, or at least significantly reduced, environmental protection measures. That is the cornerstone of the concerns. When you want to develop natural resources responsibly, you do not lower environmental standards and drop the number of inspections. On the contrary, you increase resources for scientists and inspectors. When you give a natural resources development project the green light, you should have every available credible study and an audit system. That way, you can assure the population that it will be done properly, in a way that respects the environment and sustainable development, and that avoids disasters. Canadians do not trust this government right now. It is understandable when we consider everything that has been done to reduce environmental protection.</ParaText>

              <ProceduralText TocType="TPC" id="21">Bill C-518. Second reading</ProceduralText>
              <ParaText id="3531137"> He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity today to start the debate on my private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="6251902" Type="4">C-518</Document>. Quite simply, this bill would penalize crooked, law-breaking politicians who fleece taxpayers by taking away their pensions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531138">I was the national director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation when the scandal surrounding former senator Lavigne unfolded. Like many Canadians, I was appalled at the details of the case. He quite literally stole money from taxpayers. He was ordered to repay tens of thousands of dollars for improper travel expenses. He used publicly funded staff to do his own personal chores. He was convicted in a court of law for breach of trust and fraud. Yet, while that man currently sits in prison, he is still collecting a taxpayer-sponsored pension because of a loophole.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531139">Mr. Lavigne technically resigned as a senator before he was kicked out. According to the rules, when senators resign they get to hold on to their pension. Only when senators are forced out of office for breaking the law, or are otherwise disqualified, will they lose their pension. However, if they quit before they have the chance to get fired, they will be paid a parliamentary pension. That is exactly what Mr. Lavigne did. He fleeced taxpayers while in office and now he fleeces them still.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531140">The Canadian Taxpayers Federation calculates that former senator Lavigne is receiving $67,000 per year from his publicly funded pension. That is more than most Canadians earn from honest work in a full-time job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531141">More recently, we saw Mac Harb retire from the Senate after it was discovered that he had also been fleecing taxpayers. He qualifies for a pension estimated to be over $100,000 per year. The police are investigating his actions. Should he be charged and convicted, he will be in the same boat as disgraced former senator Lavigne, with taxpayers footing the bill again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531142">This situation is unacceptable. That is why I want to change the law to close the loophole that is currently letting politicians who abuse their office and swindle taxpayers get a taxpayer-funded retirement. That is what this protecting taxpayers and revoking pensions of convicted politicians act will do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531143">First, it would add a clause to the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act to take into account the situation where a senator or a member of Parliament is convicted of an offence that arose out of conduct that occurred while that individual was in office. It would do this by using the same mechanism that is already in place for politicians who become disqualified from holding their office. The law already takes into account a situation where senators are deemed disqualified. It states that senators will receive their pension contributions plus interest and not a penny more as a lump sum when he or she “...ceases to be a Senator by reason of disqualification or was expelled from the House of Commons”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531144">Whenever senators or members of Parliament are found to have committed reprehensible crimes while in office, whether or not they are still holding that office, they should have their pensions taken away. I am sure my colleagues will agree with me that we must get rid of the loophole that currently lets crooked politicians keep their pensions if they quit before they get fired. Thus, under my bill, convicted parliamentarians would not receive a pension but would be reimbursed only their pension contributions plus the earned interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531145">Second, what I also want to accomplish with the bill is to make sure it will be applied for all future convictions of politicians, including for past malfeasance. For this reason, I have included a section clarifying that the charges contained in the bill would apply with respect to any person who is or was a member of the Senate or House of Commons and convicted after the date I introduced the bill, which was June 3, 2013.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531146">Police investigations are currently under way to look into possible criminal breach of trust, theft or fraud. Charges may be forthcoming. If any of these potential charges result in a conviction, I would want to know that this loophole was closed in time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531147">Some have wondered if this bill, which would revoke the parliamentary pension of convicted politicians, is legal and have asked the following. Can the law be modified to repeal an entitlement? Can it be applied retroactively to the near past when the bill was tabled? Can it include a crime that occurred before even the tabling date?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3531148">I can answer with certainty; the answer is yes. Yes, we can repeal a parliamentary entitlement and, as I mentioned previously, the law already provides under what circumstances that can be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531149">Indeed, I believe most analysts would agree there is not an issue on a go forward basis, that is, when the crime, the criminal charge, and the conviction, all happen after the bill is law, should it become law. However, of course, life is not that simple. We have several difficult cases before us now. They demand a remedy to protect taxpayers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531150">With regard to retroactivity to convictions after the tabling date of June 3 for crimes committed before that date, the answer again is yes and yes, and again with certainty. It can be done, for it has already been done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531151">Legislation passed earlier this year in Nova Scotia strips the pension of any lawmaker convicted of a crime for which the maximum punishment is imprisonment of no less than five years. The start date for that law was May 6, which was when the bill was tabled in the provincial legislature. The result was that in June an independent MLA lost his pension after pleading guilty to fraud and breach of trust charges arising from an expense scandal. He collected tax dollars after filing ten false expense claims in 2008 and 2009. Today he is not eligible to receive an MLA pension.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531152">I believe that taxpayers expect similar accountability from Parliament. We have an opportunity to stand with taxpayers, should any parliamentarian be found guilty of a serious crime in the future. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531153">Some have expressed concerns that the bill is too harsh. The bar that I have set in the bill would strip the pensions away from any MP or senator who commits a crime with a maximum punishment of two years or more. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531154">During my consultations, it was brought to my attention that there are some crimes in the Criminal Code with a maximum penalty of two years, for which I do not think a politician should lose their pension. There are many different crimes. I will not go through the entire list, but I hardly think that a member of Parliament should lose their pension for being convicted of blasphemous libel. Neither do I think it is necessary to strip a pension away from someone who gives a false alarm of fire. It is also conceivable that somebody could technically be guilty of crimes without the offence being so egregious that it should be grounds for losing a pension. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531155">I think all hon. members would agree that if we were to proceed with the bill, we should do so thoughtfully and carefully, to avoid unjustly revoking a parliamentary pension. I am therefore open to suggestions for improving the bill in this regard. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531156">The best suggestion I have heard so far, and with which I agree, is to limit the scope and to raise the bar. The bill currently would apply to any federal statute, again, with a penalty of two years or more as the maximum. I think it would be fair to limit the scope to only include the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531157">As I mentioned a moment ago, the bill would apply to violations for which the maximum penalty is two or more years. It would be fair to raise the bar and only consider indictable offences in which the maximum penalty is five or more years. I will therefore be moving and endorsing this higher five-year threshold at amendment stage. In doing so, this federal act would be virtually identical to provincial law in Nova Scotia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531158">I believe that my bill is an appropriate response to the unfortunate actions of a handful of people. Both of these modifications would keep the spirit of the bill entirely intact. Fraud and breach of trust would both still result in a loss of pension.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531159">The message I want to send is very simple. If a senator or an MP steals from taxpayers, they do not deserve to have taxpayers buy them or fund them a gold-plated retirement. I trust all hon. members would agree.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3531164">Mr. Speaker, I have been asked about that, the question of a spouse or dependent and how they might be impacted by the bill. I have a couple of thoughts on it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531165">The first is that we should not treat ourselves in a manner that is terribly different than ordinary Canadians. For example, if someone goes to prison today and that person has a spouse, it is difficult for that family but it is something they do without support from the state. Similarly, in my riding, if someone, for example, defrauds a government program, they not only could go to jail but they also lose the funding of that program, say employment insurance as an example. We do not, as a government or a country, make special restitutions for those kinds of examples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531166">Therefore, I am a bit wary of proceeding on a path as they did in the other place, where members are ejected but continue to collect their benefits in a way that I think is a bit offside with Canadian taxpayers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531167">My solution is that, should a member find himself or herself in a situation where they were disqualified from their pension, under Bill <Document DbId="6251902" Type="4">C-518</Document> the amount that had been contributed by the member would be returned to the member with interest. That is no small amount. We currently pay about $11,000 or $12,000 a year toward our pensions. That is going to rise to about $38,000 a year, starting after 2016. If we look at that amount over 6 or 10 years, we begin to approach a fairly healthy amount, between $300,000 and $500,000 approximately. Therefore, that addresses the hon. member's concerns to a degree. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531168">Having said that, if that is an avenue that other members want to pursue, I would be open to hearing about it. However, again, I would not want to have a loophole that is too large here, because the point of the bill is to send the signal to people to not break the rules. If they do not break the rules, the pension will be there for them.</ParaText>

He mentioned that for some of the offences with penalties of up to two years, he would not be in favour of revoking pension benefits to any particular member of either House. However, does five years really do that in some cases? Remember, this is just what he says is a maximum sentence. It is not what they have been convicted of necessarily. It runs up to a maximum of five years, which certainly could cover a whole array of charges. I am just trying to test whether he can say definitely that five years gets over that level of comfort that he is talking about. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531170">Mr. Speaker, I believe it does because if we go through the Criminal Code we will see the crimes that are generally covered by that, first and foremost, involve a kind of scheming. They are not crimes that one would fall into by accident. More to the point, it is a maximum penalty of five or more years. That does disqualify a whole range of activities that someone could fall into through a lapse of judgment, for example. I would have to ask the member, because I am short on time, to review the Criminal Code. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531171">What is important to avoid here is an example where someone like Lavigne is found guilty of breach of trust and then sentenced to six months, keeping his pension. This bill was designed, not with the penalty that was handed out, the jail time, but with the crime the individual is charged with. It would have to be a serious crime to trigger the loss of a pension. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531172">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak to Bill <Document DbId="6251902" Type="4">C-518</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531173">As I mentioned in my question to the member a few minutes ago, members of the NDP will be supporting the bill at second reading. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531174">However, I want to raise the caveats right off the top. The two caveats that we have raised are with regard to the Nova Scotia model. The Nova Scotia NDP government brought in the model legislation that basically stood by the principle that Canadian legislators should abide by the law of the land. That legislation was put in place by the NDP government in Nova Scotia and ensured that for a maximum of no less than five years any offence punishable by imprisonment would mean that the member, in this case the member of the House of Assembly in Nova Scotia, would see his or her pension benefits removed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531175">As members well know, what that does is allow, still, for the lump-sum payment on pensions, but what it takes away, if somebody has committed this criminal offence, is the additional pension top-up that the taxpayers normally would provide for a pension, whether we are talking at the provincial or the federal level.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531176">We agree with the principle that once a member of Parliament is elected, the member of Parliament has the responsibility to abide by the law of the land. Because of that, we say that this kind of legislation is welcome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531177">However, as the member has already indicated, we would be looking and seeking amendments to change it to five years for a criminal offence and we have seen, I think, from the member, some willingness to compromise on that. That is welcome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531178">The other concern that we have raised, though, and it is not a little one, is that former spouses or dependents not be penalized by this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531179">In the case of the Nova Scotia law that the Nova Scotia NDP government put into place, it ensured that any entitlement a former spouse may have in court or a court-ordered restitution would be deducted from the MHA's pension. What that means, in the context of Bill <Document DbId="6251902" Type="4">C-518</Document>, is that it would assure that those expenses, in the case of a former spouse or a court-ordered restitution, would be taken away and sent to the spouse or to the victim who receives the court-ordered restitution. That is still an open question for Bill C-518. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531180">Though we are in agreement in principle on second reading, we are certainly hoping at the committee stage that the flexibility that the member has shown with regard to the move from two years to five years would also be considered, in terms of former spouses or court-ordered restitutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531181">We agree with the principle of the bill. We do believe some of the details need to be worked on. That is our role here in Parliament, in the House of Commons. NDP members work very diligently to correct, often, mistakes or weaknesses that happen in government bills. It is our pleasure to do it up until 2015 when, of course, we will producing the type of legislation that we are sure Conservatives will be supporting because we will actually do the work beforehand so that the problems are worked out prior to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531182">However, it does raise a question because here we have a bill from a Conservative member, which is a welcome bill, that says very clearly Canada's legislators should abide by the law of the land.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531183">It just brings to mind the concerns that we have been raising in the House of Commons over a wide variety of offences that have taken place by Conservatives, and also Liberals, in the other place. We have seen this repeatedly. We have been raising these questions in the House of Commons, repeatedly, trying to get answers about the types of offences we are seeing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531184">To our mind, abiding by the law of the land has to start at the very top. It means answering clearly when questions are asked. In this House, we have been asking clear questions for a number of weeks and have been getting answers, but the answers, tragically, seem to change. Depending upon the day of the week or I guess whatever the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had for breakfast, we are getting different answers back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531185">That is not the way Parliament should function.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3531191">Mr. Speaker, the real question is accountability and transparency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531192">The responsibility of the government is to show that accountability and transparency in the House every single day. The point I am making is that the bill, which talks about accountability, says that Canada's legislators should abide by the law of the land. That is not reflected in the daily practice of government. I think that is a valid point to make.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531193">As far as the concerns that have been raised regarding many of the senators, I will just go through the list. We have Senator Mike Duffy claiming to represent a province that he did not live in. We have Senator Pamela Wallin who was doing fundraising campaigns, again at taxpayers' expense. We have Senator Patrick Brazeau who has been charged with assault.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531194">These are all examples of what happens when a legislator does not abide by the law of the land, and by the laws of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531195">The point I am making is this. It is all well and good for a government member to put forward a bill that says that if members violate the laws of the land, they will be punished. The responsibility that the government has is to make sure that the laws of the land are respected each and every day. It is not one private member's bill that makes the difference. It is the overall attitude of the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531196">The government's actions every day undermine the bill that has been brought forward. That is the issue. That is what we are debating right here on the floor of the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531197">We have gone one further, in terms of accountability and transparency, because that is what is purported to be proposed in the bill. What we said last June and what we brought forward to procedure and House affairs was a series of accountability mechanisms, as members will recall, in terms of members' expenses, which is also something that needs to be carefully governed by the law of the land and by the laws of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531198">We have said, in agreement with the Auditor General, that the Auditor General should be able to audit MPs' expenses. Unfortunately, Conservative and Liberal members have said no to this. We have also said that there needs to be independent oversight, doing away with the secretive bureau of internal economy and putting in place an independent oversight body.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531199">There again Conservatives and Liberals have said no to that. In response to the Information Commissioner saying very clearly that MPs' expenses should be subject to access to information, we have said yes. Conservatives and Liberals have said no.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531200">My point is this. The NDP has no lessons to learn from either of the old parties around accountability and transparency. It is not one bill that we put forward, it is the actions that we bring every day to the floor of the House of Commons that show the Canadian public that indeed in our case we believe in responsibility, we believe in transparency and we believe that Canadian values should be reflected on the floor of the House of Commons every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531201">What are those Canadian values? Those Canadian values are fairness. Those Canadian values are truthfulness, actually having the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> respond truthfully to the questions that are put to him in the House of Commons. We also believe that Canadian values are that of responsibility. We take responsibility for our actions and we are transparent at all times with the Canadian public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531202">That is our approach. That is the NDP approach. Like so many other Canadians, I am excited that in 2015 we will get the opportunity to put those values front and centre in the House of Commons each and every day.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531206">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time to speak to Bill <Document DbId="6251902" Type="4">C-518</Document> from my colleague from New Brunswick who brings it to the floor of the House, based on the conviction of members of Parliament as well as members of the Senate who face a sentence up to about two years, but I guess with amendments now we will go for closer to five years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531207">As my hon. colleague from the NDP pointed out, talk about public trust has come up quite often in the past couple of years and certainly there are ways by which we can set examples for ourselves as opposed to predominantly going around saying “do as I say, not as I do”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531208">In my opinion, today we are taking a step further as to the public trust and telling the public, showing the public and displaying to it that this measure has to be taken so people who come here set the right example for the rest of the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531209">For the record, within our caucus this is a free vote as this is a private member's bill. That being said, I personally will be supporting the bill for many reasons I have just mentioned, when it comes to areas of public trust and the malfeasance that has been practised by several members on the Hill, whether they be members of Parliament or also the Senate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531210">I did have some concerns, which have been addressed, one of which the member already addressed and said that he would be seeking amendments to raise that to five years. My only hesitation on that though is this opens up a whole array of offences, anything that could serve up to a maximum of five years could be looked at.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531211">I am always the one to say that sometimes when we bring legislation into the House, we make them overly prescriptive which puts people into a large straitjacket by legislation becoming law and then bringing it forward to the country so we can convict people who are wrongdoers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531212">However, in this situation maybe a list of offences should have been necessary for the sake of providing more sunlight and looking at ways in which some of these offences, as the member mentioned earlier, and I know it carries a maximum of around two years, I am not sure specifically, but certainly when it comes to issues of libel. I think false alarms was another one that he mentioned, blasphemy was another. Maybe providing a list of offences, even if it is just an illustrative list, could certainly go a long way. I do not know if the member is open to an amendment, but a lot of these offences would be taken care of. I appreciate that if we raise that from two years up to five years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531213">The other question I had was about the idea of the maximum penalty, and I will go back to the original bill as it stands now, which is two years. It is concerning that these people who are convicted and face the maximum penalty, despite the circumstances, will have their pensions revoked, as far as what benefits would be accrued to them. Obviously we are not talking about what they put into the plan themselves, they would get that back, but the benefits would have accrued from the taxpayer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531214">When I first read the bill, I thought it was a bit onerous for people who would find themselves in a situation where they only would get a small sentence given the circumstances around this conviction. However, dealing with that, the member did say that some people might get small offences, and maybe we do not agree with it. However, in this case I will still be supporting this for that discussion. I assume amendments of that nature will be coming forward depending on the situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531215">I am reticent to bring in legislation that forces a judge in the position to carry a sentence where the penalty is overly prescriptive. It puts judges in a position that takes them from why they are there in the first place, which is to exercise judgment, to judge.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3531216">I appreciate the fact that the hon. member is elevating the maximum sentence from two to five years. That may cover my concerns, but the overall principle, I believe, is that we must be careful when we look at this situation in the sense of there always being that minimum.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531217">The other thing is that my hon. colleague from the NDP talked about spouses and dependents. I know this is a private member's bill and it is not part of an ongoing dialogue where there are questions and answers after each speech, but I would like to know what the private sector standard is, after someone is convicted and put into a place of incarceration, for dependents or spouses who have no connection to the crime whatsoever and were banking on the fact that they were going to receive this money, the maximum amount available, including what was put into the plan in addition to the benefit received from that plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531218">I understand him saying that in most cases, probably all cases according to what he is saying, in the private sector that would not be the case. In other words, the family would have to tough it through. I do not know if that is always the case. I will be interested to discuss that within the committee structure itself and look for a possible amendment. My hon. colleague from the NDP brings up a good point about the idea of how spouses and dependents, who are depending on that, will be hard done by in this situation. I think in other areas it has been available in some cases, but although we may be eager to say that the loophole has been closed, this is one loophole that deserves sober second thought, if I might use that expression these days without being ridiculed.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531221">I addressed that. However, he also talked about while they were serving, which is also very important. In certain scenarios, to take people outside of serving, whether they were in the private sector or doing something else in life in other facets of the public sector, will not be looked at. Personally, the committee should look at that and see what happens outside of the jurisdiction of Parliament, whether it is the House of Commons or the Senate. However, in this case, he confines it to the subject and the people at hand, which would be, using recent examples, the senator he mentioned, along with people who may be facing charges down the road and facing conviction perhaps for certain shenanigans that are happening right now in the Senate. I will not go into the names of the senators as I do not think that is really necessary right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531222">In this bill, which is not a particularly long one, there is one principle I personally would accept. I would like to remind the House that within the Liberal caucus it is a free vote. I will be supporting this certainly going to committee because I am interested in all these questions that I have about this situation. I would like to know how the private sector handles this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531223">The overall narrative of this, which the member has pointed out and it is germane to this conversation and to me makes sense, is that there is an example that we should be setting for the Canadian public as we are entrusted public officials. Whether we are elected in the House or appointed in the Senate, there is a certain behaviour model that surpasses other occupations throughout the country. For those who conduct themselves in a way that is by far below the ethical standards we expect, then they should be punished not just by the actual conviction itself, but the benefits that would accrue by serving in the House should also be considered.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531225">When I became elected as a member of Parliament, one of the first messages that I heard loud and clear from the citizens in my area was the need to take action on gold plated MP pension plans. One of my first commitments to my constituents was to publicly support changes to the MP pension plan that were more respectful to the taxpayer. I was proud that it was our Conservative government that took historic action to reform the pensions of members of Parliament and senators. I would also like to recognize my colleagues from all sides of the House, who also supported these important changes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531226">As we know, changes to the MP pension plan and equal cost sharing ultimately mean that the pension contributions of members of the House of Commons will have to be nearly quadrupled from $11,000 to $38,000 and some change a year. I mention this because pension contributions are a key part of what is proposed in Bill <Document DbId="6251902" Type="4">C-518</Document>.</ParaText>

No different from everyday Canadians would expect to face consequences if convicted of an egregious crime, yet we also know that this is currently not the case. I would like to commend the member for <Affiliation DbId="170573" Type="2">New Brunswick Southwest</Affiliation> for his work to attempt to remedy this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531228">Currently, if a senator or member of Parliament retires or resigns prior to being convicted, or otherwise manoeuvres to avoid being expelled or disqualified from Parliament, that individual is still entitled to his or her full pension, including the employer's share, which is funded by taxpayers. In other words, if one retires or resigns before being convicted of a crime, one still benefits from a generous pension plan. This is, in itself, an outrage to many taxpayers. I would submit that this sentiment is shared by members of the House. That is why this is a very important issue for discussion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531229">Again, I would like to commend the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170573" Type="2">New Brunswick Southwest</Affiliation> for bringing this issue forward. His work on this file and his commitment to ensuring that taxpayer dollars are always respected is laudable. As it stands, the bill before us would automatically revoke a member's pension where certain criteria, as defined in the bill, are met, regardless of whether the member had already retired or resigned from his or her seat in Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531230">Specifically, the bill would disentitle the taxpayer funded pension of a member who met the following criteria: a member is convicted of an indictable offence under an act of Parliament that carries a maximum prison sentence of not less than two years, or the offence arose out of conduct that occurred before June 3, 2013, while this person was a member. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531231">I should also point out that the member would still be entitled to a withdrawal allowance, which is a single lump sum refund of the member's personal contributions. However, the employer's pension contributions on behalf of the member, the portion which is publicly funded, would not be refunded. That is an important distinction. Moreover, the member would no longer be eligible for post-retirement health or dental benefits, since entitlement to these benefits is predicated on eligibility for a pension.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3531232">We know that Canadians expect all senators and all members of Parliament to be held to the highest standards of accountability. Canadians have told us that they expect their representatives to protect the integrity of public office in our public institutions. As I stated earlier, as members of Parliament we have voted in support of pension changes that are more respectful to taxpayers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531233">Our government is also taking historic action to reform the pensions of public servants. The contribution rates for the public service pension plan are also moving to a 50-50 cost-sharing model by 2017. We have also increased the age at which members of Parliament can retire with an unreduced pension. It will rise from 55 to 65 as of January 1, 2016. In addition, newly hired public servants will become eligible to collect their pensions at age 65 instead of 60.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531234">Over the next five years, these measures will save taxpayers $2.6 billion. These are substantial savings. They are also savings realized by fairness. Moving MP and public sector pensions to equal employer funding and raising the age of retirement are principles that are respectful and equitable to taxpayers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531235">Bill <Document DbId="6251902" Type="4">C-518</Document> proposes similar respect to taxpayers for those parliamentarians who would retire or resign prior to a conviction and still collect a fully funded pension plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531236">While I support the principles in this bill, I do have some concerns. Many others have raised concerns as well, some of which the member has addressed. Specifically, it is imperative that a bill of this nature clearly establish where and how the bar is set that would enact this legislation. As the bill is currently proposed, I believe greater clarification on this question will be beneficial. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531237">I was going to cite an example. However, as the member for <Affiliation DbId="170573" Type="2">New Brunswick Southwest</Affiliation> indicated in his comments that he is already contemplating changes in this area, I will simply point out that as parliamentarians, we must be cognizant that what a bill intends to propose may not necessarily be interpreted in the same manner by our successors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531238">In summary, I believe that Bill <Document DbId="6251902" Type="4">C-518</Document> proposes to take action on what I would characterize as a loophole that allows parliamentarians to avoid full accountability and still collect generous taxpayer-provided pension benefits. While this is an important area to examine and consider, and one that I believe Canadians support, it is equally important that as members of Parliament we must ensure that the wording in this bill is clear to the intent of its stated objectives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531239">To that end, I am hopeful that further revisions at committee stage will enhance the clarity of this bill.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3531240">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="6251902" Type="4">C-518</Document>, which would amend the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531241">This bill would revoke the privilege of a retirement pension or compensation allowance for former members of the Senate or House of Commons who are convicted of an offence under an act of Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531242">Parliamentarians must have been indicted for an offence with a maximum punishment of imprisonment for not less than two years. The offence must have been committed, in whole or in part, while the person was an MP or Senator. Most Criminal Code offences fall into this category. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531243">The idea of punishing these offenders is not new. Nova Scotia's NDP government has already passed similar legislation. Under that law, all entitlements of a former spouse, or any court-ordered restitution, can be deducted from the pension of the MP in question. This is a very important point because it is not included in the bill that I am debating. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531244">In a few moments, I will give an example that demonstrates how this gap in the law can lead to the victimization of someone who is already a victim of an act of violence. I will come back to that shortly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531245"> We know that a parliamentarian sentenced to a jail term of less than two years does not lose his status as a parliamentarian and may continue to sit, unless he is expelled by the Senate or the House. However, this power is rarely used. Some charter provisions could potentially protect parliamentarians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531246"> The proposals include parliamentarians found guilty of crimes subject to sentences of more than two years, but they could be punished with a shorter jail term or perhaps even a suspended sentence or community service. The proposal is more specific with regard to the fact that the crime must be committed when the parliamentarian is in office. This is an important point. The crime must be committed while the parliamentarian is performing his duties, not before and not after. In any case, if it were before he was elected, the bill would not apply to him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531247"> Today, a parliamentarian may commit a crime, complete his term as a parliamentarian and be convicted a number of years after completing his term in office. Current sections 19 and 39 of the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act do not take this situation into account. Right now, senators and members of Parliament must have been defeated or expelled before they can be penalized. The new proposal would be retroactive to June 2013 for a parliamentarian found guilty well after the period when the crime is committed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531248"> What is the loss for a parliamentarian who commits a crime? They are just going to lose the additional contribution by Parliament. Parliamentarians lose a privilege, not a pension entitlement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531249"> Of course, with all the scandals we have heard about, the general public and we ourselves are sick of all these stories and we want justice to be done. It is not surprising that sometimes, when we are taking part in an activity, people ask us to give them money. They make inappropriate comments because they perceive politicians as corrupt. This must be stopped. More than just changing the legislation, we—senators and members of Parliament—must change our behaviour in Parliament. It is the culture that must change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531250"> Of course, the legislation goes with the culture, and with the changes, but to date we have put up with too much. People have even decided not to vote because they no longer have confidence in us. They say that they vote, but nothing changes. They think that parliamentarians commit fraud and they are paid by taxpayers. We must bear in mind that the money we receive is money that comes from taxpayers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531251"> All this is important, and this bill aims at improving the situation. However, some things are missing from the bill. We cannot just change the legislation; we must change our behaviour and the way we engage in politics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531252">I would like to mention two examples, one of which is Senator Brazeau, who is accused of sexual assault. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> told the House that it was a personal matter that made it necessary to remove him from the Senate caucus. He is still a senator.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3531253">He said:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531254">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Our understanding is that these are matters of a personal nature rather than Senate business, but they are very serious and we expect they will be dealt with through the courts.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531255">I am mentioning this because the man in question assaulted his partner in their home. There is another case, that of Raymond Lavigne, the former senator who is currently in prison. He was convicted of fraud and breach of trust. However, he committed the offences in his role as a senator, using public money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531256">I am raising these examples because when we were discussing the Nova Scotia law earlier today, it was said that the spouse of the accused still has the right to part of the pension. However, under the new proposal, if Mr. Brazeau is convicted, he will lose his privileges and, since the law is retroactive to June 2013, his partner, the victim, will lose them as well. It will be his ex-wife, since I imagine that they will divorce. She will be a double victim. We need to take those aspects into consideration in order to improve this bill. That is why the NDP is committed to supporting it at second reading, so that the committee can address certain gaps in the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531257">However, in the case of Senator Lavigne, the legislation unfortunately came out too late. He was convicted of misappropriating Senate funds. He is presently in prison, but, for the six years that the trial lasted, his pension fund continued to grow. This legislation therefore still lets him profit from his transgressions because it is retroactive to June 2013. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531258">The task I am giving to committee members is to improve some aspects of the legislation. Just now, I mentioned that Mr. Brazeau's wife is twice a victim, but I have a bit of a problem with something else. It has to do with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the idea of a double penalty. We have to be careful because we are talking here about a punitive sanction on a privilege. We agree on that. However, say a senator leaves a Christmas party having had a bit too much to drink and hits someone with his car because he is driving while impaired, he will be convicted and will pay for what he did. However, at the same time, he will be punished again. I am just concerned about that. It must be improved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531259">With people using public funds, like Mr. Lavigne, or like the others we have spent a lot of time talking about here—Mr. Duffy and Ms. Wallin—we get it. The money belongs to us all. It is related to their duties. We must therefore pay attention and specify the penalties more clearly so that we do not descend into an inequality of sorts. That is what concerns me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531260">The NDP will be continuing to discuss that aspect. As parliamentarians, it is in our nature to believe deeply in democracy. In committee, we must work to improve the legislation, because what we have to stand up for above all is the greater good and the advancement of democracy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531261">It is fine to sanction people who break the law in the performance of their duties. However, as I said, we have to be careful not to victimize someone a second time, as in the cases I mentioned. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531262">We must change our way of engaging in politics. We must not shelter those who commit fraud. We must not become complicit. I am sure that many of us feel ashamed of the actions of some people, who shall remain nameless. Those of us who are seriously committed to our work feel tainted by things not of our doing. We must have the courage to say that it must stop. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531264">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the principles involved in Bill <Document DbId="6251902" Type="4">C-518, an act to amend the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act (withdrawal allowance)</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531265">As we know, the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act is the legislation that governs pensions for members of the House of Commons and for senators. The bill being discussed today proposes to change that legislation. It proposes to disentitle a parliamentarian to a taxpayer-funded pension if he or she is convicted of an indictable offence under an act of Parliament that carries a maximum prison sentence of not less than two years. In addition, the offence must have arisen out of conduct that occurred before June 3, 2013, and while the person was a member of Parliament or a senator. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531266">As well as disentitling the person to a taxpayer-funded pension, the legislation would cause him or her to lose eligibility for the post-retirement health and dental benefits that normally come with the pension plan. The person would, however, be entitled to receive a refund of the monies that he or she contributed to that pension.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531267">We believe the work that the hon. member has put into this bill is laudable. As parliamentarians, we have a tremendous responsibility to Canadians, and the citizens of our country have the right to demand the highest standard of ethical conduct from us. This is part and parcel of our job. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531268">People elected to the House of Commons and those appointed to the Senate are expected to craft the laws that govern the land, and for the laws to be right, the people who make them must be right. Indeed, the highest ethical standards are an integral part of the jobs with which we are entrusted. Canadians expect nothing less.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531269">When we compromise that trust, Canadians deserve recourse, and justice demands recourse. Let me also reiterate that one of the abiding beliefs of our government is that people in public office must be accountable for their actions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531270">Strengthening accountability is one of the hallmarks of our government. On coming into office, our first order of business was to introduce and implement the Federal Accountability Act and the accompanying action plan, which demonstrates our commitment to that accountability. This act provides Canadians with the assurance that the powers entrusted in the government are being exercised in the public interest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531271">Through the Federal Accountability Act and the accompanying action plan, we brought in a series of accountability reforms. Among these reforms were the designation of deputy ministers and deputy heads as accounting officers and the requirement that they appear before parliamentary committees, the five-year review of the relevance and effectiveness of departmental grant and contribution programs, the new mandate for the Auditor General to follow the money to grant and contribution recipients, the law requiring departments to send results of public opinion research to Library and Archives Canada within six months, and the removal of the entitlement of political staff to priority appointments in the public service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531272">These reforms were followed up by others, including new electoral financing rules and restrictions on gifts to political candidates; the Public Service Disclosure Protection Act; the new Conflict of Interest Act; tougher penalties and sanctions for people who commit fraud involving taxpayers' money; clarification and simplification of the rules governing grants and contributions; the extension of the Access to Information Act to cover agents of Parliament, five foundations, and the Canadian Wheat Board; and regulations to ensure lobbying and government advocacy was done fairly and openly. In all, our Federal Accountability Act and action plan made substantive changes to some 45 federal statutes and amended over 100 others, touching virtually every part of government and beyond.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3531273">As a result of these efforts, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, cabinet ministers, parliamentarians, and other public service employees are more accountable today than ever before in Canadian history. Our commitment to accountability has not waned one iota. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531274">I conclude by saying that this bill is consistent with the principles behind those measures to which we have spoken. Since our government came to power, we have worked to protect the integrity of parliamentary office and the conduct Canadians expect of their members of Parliament and senators, strengthen accountability in our public institutions, operate with respect for taxpayers' dollars, and punish those in a position of power who break the law. We will continue to do so.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3531278">Mr. Speaker, this is the second hour of debate on this legislation, which was introduced in the last session of Parliament. It is Bill <Document DbId="6251854" Type="4">C-479, the fairness for the victims of violent offenders act</Document>. I will support this legislation going to committee for consideration and, where necessary, for amendment. I want to underline the fact that Liberals want some amendments to this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531279">Again, the intent of this bill is to provide additional measures for victims of crime, in this case the ability to ensure that victims of violent crime have a greater legislated role in any parole actions related to offenders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531280">The major elements of the bill are that the bill would extend the period between parole reviews from two to five years for violent offenders who are not granted parole at first or subsequent reviews or whose parole has been revoked. This change would apply only to offenders incarcerated for violent crimes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531281">Ostensibly, this bill is aimed at relieving the victims of violent crimes or their families from having to attend frequent parole hearings. That is a good intent. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531282">The bill does not alter the rules governing initial parole eligibility. The bill also contains uncontroversial changes that codify victims' rights already recognized and applied in the parole process. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531283">However, the bill's evidentiary basis remains entirely unclear. The rationale for choosing a maximum interval of five years between parole hearings for those denied parole instead of, for example, four, as in the previous iteration of the bill, remains unclear. The impact of extending the maximum time between parole hearings on offender rehabilitation is also unclear. Study at committee would allow members to debate the bill's merits on the basis of evidence from expert testimony. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531284">I would reiterate the concerns expressed by the member for <Affiliation DbId="170322" Type="2">Lac-Saint-Louis</Affiliation> with respect to the constitutionality of the legislation. I note that the courts are now beginning to challenge the efficacy of the mandatory minimum sentencing and the manner in which the government has attempted to alter the Criminal Code and the Corrections and Conditional Release Act to support an ideological agenda based on public fear of criminal activity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531285">This is another in a long list of private members' bills coming forward from Conservative backbench members. They all may be great in terms of their intent, but these are members of the government, and this is the Criminal Code that we are dealing with. It is a complex, massive code. Coming forward with off-the-wall requests for legislation could jeopardize the very intent of what members want to do with this legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531286">I see members smiling on the other side. This is not a joking matter. We are talking about the Criminal Code of Canada. What is happening on that side of the House is that they are allowing Conservative members to come forward with little private members' bills from their own riding so they can cater to their own power base. Do they not realize that they could, in the process, have a court throw out the legislation and make a victim of the very person we do not want to make a victim? That is the possible consequence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531287">I will turn to the Correctional Investigator's message in terms of how the government is really dealing with its tough-on-crime agenda. In the beginning of the report, he speaks of the time in 1973 when the first correctional investigator was appointed for federally sentenced inmates. It was a time when there was rioting in prisons. There were burnings and real trouble within the prison system. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531292">With this specific bill, I would request, and will do so at committee, that the member present a list of experts and the evidence they provided, which he referenced in his remarks on May 10 of this year, as to his claim that “this bill has a sound legal and constitutional foundation”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531293">I will also be requesting that the member provide the evidence upon which this legislation was based. For example, upon what evidence did the member opposite base the determination that a period of five years between subsequent applications is justified? I trust that the member will provide that evidence at the committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531294">I make note of the concern, given the recent case of Bill <Document DbId="6251827" Type="4">C-489</Document>, introduced by his colleague the member for <Affiliation DbId="170478" Type="2">Langley</Affiliation>. In the course of second reading of that bill, the member gave the House the assurance that the bill was well drafted and was adequate. He did acknowledge that he was open to amendments, and indeed the elements of the bill were subsequently amended.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531295">With regard to the amendments, there were six amendments to a bill with five clauses. Let me repeat that: six amendments to a five-clause bill. They were moved by members of the government on behalf of the Government of Canada. During this process, a representative of the Department of Justice was in attendance to ensure the amendments accorded with what even the government determined was the need to ratchet back on some of the extreme and likely challengeable features of the member's original bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531296">It goes to my point. The government has all these backbenchers over there, but it is not bringing forward legislation in a comprehensive way on an issue as important as the Criminal Code of Canada. I believe we are getting 16 private members' bills on various subjects by members. As this bill clearly shows, it needed to be amended or the Department of Justice knew the bill would be thrown out by a court. The extent would be that it would create new victims as a result of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531297">In the end, the bill was attempting to institute a mandatory minimum distance for offenders to have to maintain from the dwellings of the victims of specific crimes. It was amended in such a way as to add to the list of locations already in the Criminal Code from which a judge can currently apply a limitation on that of dwelling. We were told the whole intent and purpose of the legislation was so the judge could not use discretion, but the end result was that the ability of the judge to use discretion remains within the code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531298">In conclusion, we will support the bill going to committee. We will see if there will be amendments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531299">In closing, I want to underline that while we see some merit in this bill, we would prefer to see legislation from the government after they have talked in their caucus on various proposals in an all-encompassing way, in a way that fits legitimately within the Criminal Code of Canada. We do not want to see it add more risk to what a court might do in terms of challenging that legislation and throwing it out. It should be done in a comprehensive way, rather than these simple bills coming forward to play to the Conservative base.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="170220" Type="2">Mr. François Pilon (Laval—Les Îles, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3531300">Mr. Speaker, I am really pleased to speak to the bill we have before us today, Bill <Document DbId="6251854" Type="4">C-479, An Act to amend the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (fairness for victims)</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531301">This bill is based for the most part on the recommendation made by the former federal ombudsman for victims of crime and seeks to pay special attention to the perspective of victims in the criminal justice process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531302">Bill <Document DbId="6251854" Type="4">C-479</Document> broadens the rights of victims under the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. It incorporates into law some of the elements that are already part of the current practice in parole hearings. Some of those elements are in fact consistent with the recommendations made by the former ombudsman in his special report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531303">Under this bill, victims would have more opportunities to attend parole hearings, and offenders would have considerably less access to reviews.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531304">The NDP, however, is concerned that the bill adds five years to the interval between parole reviews for violent offenders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531305">This goes against the ombudsman's previous recommendations that this extension apply only to dangerous offenders and those serving a life sentence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531306">The people working with victims and those working with inmates agree that parole is an essential component of public safety. This change could prevent some offenders from having access to parole and, by extension, deny them the benefits of a supervised release in the community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531307">This amendment therefore would lead to a situation where many violent offenders would reach the end of their sentence without having had access to supervised release. They would then be out in the community for the first time, fully free and without any supervision at the end of their sentence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531308">On our side, we work tirelessly to improve the safety of the public. We believe that one way to achieve this goal is to implement a parole process that helps people reintegrate safely, and I emphasize the word “safely”, into the community to reduce victimization and the risk of reoffending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531309">We also support the victims and their families, and we want to work with them to ensure that in addition to taking legislative action to help them, we also provide them with the services they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531310">Instead of focusing on the shortcomings of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act as a whole, this is yet another Conservative piecemeal bill that actually does very little to ensure the safety of our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531311">I will briefly run through the changes, or, more specifically, the amendments, proposed in Bill <Document DbId="6251854" Type="4">C-479</Document>: the parole review of offenders who are serving a sentence of at least two years for an offence involving violence; the attendance of victims and members of their family at parole review hearings; the consideration of victims’ statements by the National Parole Board when making a determination regarding the release of an offender; the manner of presentation of victims’ statements at a parole review hearing; the providing of information under consideration by the Board to a victim; the cancellation of a parole review hearing if an offender has repeatedly refused to attend, or waived his or her right to attend, previous hearings; the providing of transcripts of a parole review hearing to the victim and members of their family and the offender; and the notification of victims if an offender is to be released on temporary absence, parole or statutory release.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531312">We think that this bill has several good points. That is why we will support it at second reading so that it can be sent to committee.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="50">(1750)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3531313">We also believe that it is appropriate for victims to attend parole board hearings, for example, when it is likely that the offender will return to live in the community where he committed the crime, or when a victim is asking for specific condition to be placed on the offender after release, such as a non-communication order. We also think that allowing victims to attend hearings via video conference or teleconference is a valid point in Bill <Document DbId="6251854" Type="4">C-479</Document>, especially for victims with mobility problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531314">We also want victims and their families to feel that they are really involved the process. However, we must also ensure that offenders have access to appropriate services, whether in the correctional system or the parole system, such as supervised release, so that recidivism rates fall after offenders have served their full sentences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531315">We do see some weaknesses in Bill <Document DbId="6251854" Type="4">C-479</Document>, however, and it is important to point them out. For example, an offender who serves a sentence of less than five years might have only one chance at parole under Bill <Document DbId="6251854" Type="4">C-479</Document>. If his first application is denied, it is quite possible that he will serve his entire sentence without ever having been granted conditional release. This means that offenders will be released at the end of their sentences without any conditions, and more importantly, without the benefit of any rehabilitation or reintegration programs. It goes without saying that this poses a risk to public safety and that such a practice would likely result in higher recidivism rates and therefore an increase in the number of victims of crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531316">Society would be better served by the gradual, supervised release of offenders who pose a risk. Such release helps offenders reintegrate into society safely and with the supervision they need to facilitate their reintegration, thereby reducing the likelihood that they will commit other criminal acts. If the Conservative government is truly serious about helping victims and their families, it will provide them with services and reintegrate criminals into society in such a way as to prevent the risk of victimization and recidivism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531317">In closing, the NDP's message to victims and their families is simple: we support greater victim involvement in the parole process. We also support many of the recommendations made by the former federal ombudsman for victims of crime, as well as his criticisms of Bill <Document DbId="6251854" Type="4">C-479</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531318">We are working tirelessly on making our communities safer. Our plan goes beyond the Conservatives' simplistic ideology and really gets to the heart of the problem, rather than just scratching the surface. We want to help victims create a safer process that will reduce the risk of recidivism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531319">We hope the government will be receptive to the suggestions we will be making in committee.</ParaText>

Forgive me for saying for those who are atheists and of other religions, but I think they will allow me to say on this occasion of the expectation of the birth of our Lord, that we await His coming and we celebrate Christmas in the spirit of the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531371">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour in the House to speak to Bill <Document DbId="6251854" Type="4">C-479, an Act to bring fairness for the victims of violent offenders</Document>. I am dedicated and passionate about seeing this bill through because the changes it would bring about for victims and their families are overdue. Today marks one step closer in the legislative process in seeing these changes become a reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531372">First, I would like to thank the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170515" Type="2">Scarborough Centre</Affiliation>, who is also the <Affiliation DbId="194844" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation>, for her strong support the last time we debated Bill <Document DbId="6251854" Type="4">C-479</Document> in the House. In her role, she has been a strong advocate for victims in her community and across the country, and I congratulate her on her work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531373">The parliamentary secretary, the <Affiliation DbId="194614" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="194629" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> were busy this past summer, hearing from victims across the country. We look forward to hearing more from them in the months ahead on the federal government's support for victims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531374"> I am proud that Bill <Document DbId="6251854" Type="4">C-479</Document> complements our government's work to support victims and their families from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531375"> I would also like to thank and acknowledge the hon. members for <Affiliation DbId="170462" Type="2">Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="170750" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="170401" Type="2">Alfred-Pellan</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="170748" Type="2">Abitibi—Témiscamingue</Affiliation> for the support they offered in the House to bring this bill to committee. I appreciate their kind words on my intent in bringing forward this bill. While they have raised some points that will be further debated in committee, I have no doubt that their hearts are in the right place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531376">All of us on both sides of the House should desire to do everything we can to bring about fairness for victims and their families and act on some of the recommendations of the victims ombudsman. Contrary to the member for <Affiliation DbId="170158" Type="2">Malpeque</Affiliation>'s comments, this bill is not about the Criminal Code, but the Corrections and Conditional Release Act and victims' rights. This is all about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531377">I offer special thanks to the Federal Ombudsman for Victims of Crime, Sue O'Sullivan, for meeting with me and my staff and for all of her advice and support in the development of this bill. Many of the provisions of Bill <Document DbId="6251854" Type="4">C-479</Document> stem from the recommendations made by Ms. O'Sullivan and her office. I appreciate and respect the work that she and her team do on a daily basis to advocate for victims. It is tough, emotional and unrelenting work and they do it effectively, professionally and compassionately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531378">I have also heard from victims. To me, that is the ultimate litmus test of this bill. When they tell me that it will make a difference and that we are on the right track, I know that this makes sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531379">Please allow me to conclude this debate at second reading where I began. That is by reiterating my intent in bringing forward this bill. As I have said at each stage of the process, it was an eye opening and heart-wrenching experience at a hearing of the National Parole Board of Canada in the summer of 2010 that led me to introduce this bill. Invited to observe as a guest of my constituents, I witnessed first hand how the system revictimized the people who had already suffered enough for a lifetime. Since that time, I have witnessed many more meetings, all just as gut-wrenching and painful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531380">Constable Michael Sweet's story and his family's reasonable request to have more information has profoundly affected me as well. Their point is well taken that their father and husband's life was taken from them publicly. The offenders were tried publicly, with all of the evidence being introduced publicly. Victims, their families and all Canadians should have some public assurance that those convicted of violent offences are doing what they can to be rehabilitated and become contributing citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531381">If an act to bring fairness for the victims of violent offenders eases the revictimization of just one family, it will be worth it, but I am convinced that it would do much more.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531392">Mr. Chair, it is great to be here tonight. Before I begin my speech, I just want to say that we are doing some last work of the House of Commons before we go for our Christmas break, but certainly it is not the least work. This is an extremely important discussion we are having tonight. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531393">I, as well as others, certainly want to wish the staff and pages a good vacation away from here for a few extra weeks. As the member for <Affiliation DbId="170542" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation> pointed out, I think we also need to remember that this is the season we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ and all that it means.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531394">Tonight I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the discussion of the Ukraine at this very important and troubling juncture. Canada was both shocked and disappointed when the Ukrainian government suddenly announced, on November 21, that it would not be pursuing an association agreement on a deep and comprehensive free trade area with the European Union.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531395">This was an abrupt reversal from years of planning and earnest negotiations on the part of our European partners and a divergence from Ukraine's promised path of deeper partnership and integration with the west. All indications until that point had been that the Ukrainian government would make its best effort to reform its institutions, its economy, and its legal system in the best interest of its people and the country's future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531396">The European Parliament's special envoys, former Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski and former European Parliament President Cox, had travelled together to the Ukraine some 27 times since 2011 in an impressive display of shuttle diplomacy. They had worked hard to find a solution to the issue of selective justice in the case of imprisoned former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, an issue that had to be resolved before an EU-Ukraine deal could be agreed upon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531397">In one instant, those efforts were swept aside by President Viktor Yanukovych. This regrettable decision by his government came just days ahead of the EU's eastern partnership summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, where the association agreement was scheduled to be signed. Yanukovych instead turned his back on the European Union, and worst of all, on the will of his people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531398">As soon as this decision was announced, ordinary Ukrainians took peacefully to the streets. They unfurled their blue and yellow Ukrainian flags alongside the blue and yellow banner of the European Union. Their hopes had been dashed by a decision taken by a government out of touch with the will of its people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531399">As the date of the Vilnius summit drew near, more and more Ukrainians gathered at Kiev's Independence Square, by the tens of thousands, amid the bitter cold, recalling scenes of the spontaneous Orange Revolution of 2004-05. That people-powered revolution sought to bring accountability, democracy, and the rule of law to the Ukraine. Today those values again are in jeopardy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531400">As the Vilnius summit came and went and a deal was left unsigned, more concerned Ukrainians, determined to ensure that their European aspirations not be squandered, streamed into the squares and streets of Kiev and other Ukrainian cities. According to reliable estimates, as many as 800,000 protestors marched in Kiev on December 1 in a display of solidarity against the government's decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531401">Thousands of concerned Canadians, as well, demonstrated that day in front of the Ukrainian embassy in Ottawa and in towns and cities across this country. Canadians were taken to demonstrate not only in support of the aspirations of the Ukrainian people but also in response to the egregious acts of violence carried out by Ukrainian authorities the day before, on November 30, against peaceful protestors in Kiev's Independence Square.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531402">On that day, the <Affiliation DbId="170677" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> expressed Canada's strong condemnation of this deplorable use of violence. He called on the Government of Ukraine to respect and protect the rights of its citizens to express their opinions freely and to respect the freedom of assembly as rights inherent in any truly democratic country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531403">As we know, such values and principles are the cornerstones of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the OSCE, an organization that has been chaired in 2013 by none other than Ukraine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531404">On December 5 and 6, the OSCE's annual meeting of foreign ministers, the ministerial council, took place in the Ukrainian capital. It was an egregious affront to OSCE values and principles that so many of them, including freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, and the protection of journalists, had been violated in the host city on the eve of the ministerial.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531405">The <Affiliation DbId="170677" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation>, who attended the OSCE ministerial on behalf of Canada, made it clear that such actions were unacceptable and an affront to the values that we all, as OSCE members, strive for. He expressed Canada's deep disappointment that the Ukrainian government had, in balking at implementing the measures necessary to sign an association agreement in Vilnius, effectively suspended the country's path toward democratic development and economic prosperity. This was clearly not the wish of the people of Ukraine.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="20">(1820)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3531406">While in Kiev, the minister met with his Ukrainian counterpart, Minister Kozhara, to express Canada's grave concerns about the Ukrainian government's crackdown on mass protests against its decision to suspend negotiations. He also met with leaders of the Ukrainian opposition and with representatives of civil society to voice Canada's support for the democratic rights of all Ukrainians. He also visited Independence Square, where he met personally with many of the protesters. People on the square chanted, “Thank you, Canada”, and cheered when he arrived. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531407">The clear signals of the Ukrainian people have been broadcast around the world. The most concerning and disappointing aspect has been the Ukrainian authority's reaction to those peaceful protests. We will continue to stand with those Ukrainians who believe in freedom, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531408">Canada hopes that preparations for a Ukraine-EU agreement can resume in the near future. This recent development must not stop the Euro-Atlantic and European integration processes, as they reflect a genuine aspiration among Ukrainians to embrace the values of freedom, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. Canada will continue to be there for help. Our development assistance programs in Ukraine will continue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531409">It is worth noting that at this moment, Canada has over two dozen election observers either deployed or being deployed to Ukraine to monitor the parliamentary by-elections being held on December 15 in five electoral districts where electoral fraud invalidated the results during the nationwide parliamentary elections of 2012. This is only our most recent and current demonstration of our government's ongoing commitment to Ukrainian democracy. Since Ukraine's renewed independence in 1991, Canada has played a pioneering and influential role, and I would say a continuing role, in promoting freedom, democracy, and human rights in this important country with which so many Canadians share deep historical, cultural, and people-to-people ties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531410">We are determined to continue to assist the Ukrainian people in achieving their aspirations for a fully free and democratic society while helping to transform Ukraine's economy into a better, more transparent, rules-based, and liberalized marketplace that is better equipped to integrate with a diversified global economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531411">In conclusion, our Canadian values and our deep and long-standing friendship with the Ukrainian people demand nothing less of us.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531418">I should just point out that we are actually the sixth largest donor of technical assistance to Ukraine. We have invested over $410 million in the official development assistance program we have been part of. We are contributing about $20 million annually, as the member opposite pointed out, which is geared toward issues of democracy, improving things around the rule of law, and increasing economic opportunities for Ukraine and Ukrainians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531419">One of the reasons this is so frustrating is that the leadership of Ukraine has decided that they are not that interested right now in pursuing this agreement with the EU. We have spent a lot of time and effort working with folks there trying to set it up so that they have economic opportunities. We do not see them turning eastward rather than coming into and integrating with the EU, which would be a development that would be in their best interest economically.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531421">Canada has always stood with the Ukrainian people through the long relationship between the Ukraine and Canada. I think of Mr. Mulroney being quick to recognize the Ukrainian independence in 1991 and Mr. Martin being quick to acknowledge the Orange Revolution toward democracy in 2004.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531422">Sometimes over the course of those years our support has been rhetorical. Other times it has been specific and tangible. In the present circumstances, it is important to find the ways to move our position from rhetoric to concrete action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531423">Obviously, we need to make sure that any action that is taken does not impinge upon the Ukrainian people in a negative way. It is the behaviour of Mr. Yanukovych that is the problem here. In the past there has been some discussion about Canada or other countries leading an international dialogue toward a set of Yanukovych-specific sanctions, so that we are not imposing any burdens upon the Ukrainian people but are focusing our attention on Mr. Yanukovych himself. That could include the group of oligarchs who support him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531424">Is the government prepared to consider that type of measure, at least to have some discussion with our allies, the United States and European allies, specifically about what the world community can do to focus a set of sanctions, such as freezing assets and limiting travel, aimed specifically at Mr. Yanukovych and the oligarchs around him to make sure that they cannot conduct their campaigns against the Ukrainian people with impunity, and just get away with it and go on a holiday when they feel like it?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531425">Mr. Chair, what I should first point out is the importance of the Ukrainian heritage and Ukrainian ties to the province of both the member who just spoke and myself, particularly the northeast corner of our province. People from eastern Europe and particularly the Ukraine played a huge role in the development of Saskatchewan and the benefits that we are seeing now. Therefore, it is important to us that we address this issue seriously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531426">We are at the point where we see these political trends as being very troubling. However, our policy in the past is one that we believe we should continue, and that is a principle of engagement with the Ukraine. We have consistently messaged and urged action from the Ukrainian authorities that they protect the rule of law, work toward human rights and strengthen democracy. We continue to carry that message to them. We want to support those folks who are out on the streets who believe that those are important principles, that the Ukraine continues to move in the direction of seeing stronger democracy, a stronger rule of law, and in particular, seeing human rights protected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531427">What really concerned us was that when the attacks took place in the Independence Square, the first people who seemed to be attacked were journalists. It looked like there was some attempt to keep the story from getting out and to limit that. The principles of freedom of association, freedom of speech and protection for journalists are very important and need to be protected in the Ukraine.</ParaText>

There is no reason Ukraine cannot be one of the great nations of Europe today. However, there are these troubling events going on in Ukraine today, such as the present rejection of the EU association agreement and the Euromaidan protests in the square.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531431">More troubling than that is the crackdown on some of these protesters. I would be interested in the parliamentary secretary's view on Canada's view of the harsh treatment some of these protestors have received from the security forces.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531432">Mr. Chair, around the world, we stand as a country that respects the rule of law, respects human rights and insists on the development of democracy wherever we go. Certainly it has been a great disappointment over the last couple of weeks in particular to see Ukrainian authorities taking the measures they have. As I mentioned a little earlier, the first thing that seemed to have happened was that journalists and foreign journalists were being attacked so they could not get the story out to the rest of the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531433">Certainly, protesters are in the streets. They want to be peaceful and they want to get their point across that they really do see their future in EU integration. The authorities need to listen to that. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3531439">Mr. Chair, I thank my colleagues who are here to focus on Ukraine because as we have noted already in this debate, it is a topic of great importance, not just for us here but for the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531440">I want to start with a personal story. It was in 2004 when my mother went to Ukraine to be an election observer. She came back moved by the fact that the people of Ukraine had taken it upon themselves to really embrace something we take for granted here. That was democracy. She came back with such wonderful stories of people who had participated in the democratic franchise, who had participated in politics in its best form.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531441"> It was an exciting time. It was the time of the Orange Revolution, which obviously predated any orange wave. It was a time where people had hope and optimism for the future. It was a dream that was being laid out for the people of Ukraine. This was not a dream that they had to strive for beyond their lifetimes; this was a dream they could live right now. It was the dream of living in a country where people were able to decide with a democratic franchise who was to decide the fate of their future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531442">It is with some concern and sadness that I am gripped with what is happening right now. My mother spent her Christmas there and she just had a couple of Christmases with me after that before she passed away, but I will never forget the excitement that she had for the people of Ukraine. She told me about a very long train ride she had to take to go to the area where she was an election observer and the people she met. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531443">I think the magic of 2004 needs to be remembered right now, needs to be remembered with the people who are now in Independence Square who are saying, “We will not forget the dream. No one is going to steal the dream away from us. We stand for the dream of Ukraine to make sure it is free, it is democratic and no one is going to take that dream away from us”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531444">It is about people and it is about democratic franchise. It is about those things we take for granted here. I am proud to stand tonight in support of the people of Ukraine and in support of the democratic liberties, their human rights, their vision of a peaceful and prosperous country. Just as in 2004, Ukrainians are demonstrating that they will be masters of their own destiny.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531445">I have been monitoring the situation closely as to what is happening in Ukraine, along with many of my colleagues. I am deeply concerned by the government's use of force against peaceful protesters. There is no place in a democratic society for the use of force by the state against peaceful protesters, and of course we want to see that ended.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531446">Free speech and the right to peacefully protest are fundamental to any democracy. Around the world and throughout history, these are among the most basic rights people fight to obtain. It is worth noting that on the day that we are celebrating the life of Madiba, of Mandela, that the people in Ukraine and Independence Square are fighting for what he was fighting for. They have different contexts in terms of being in different situations, but the same ideals, the ability to speak freely, not to be jailed because of one's beliefs, not to be beaten because of one's want to protest civilly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531447">I think Canada should continue to send a clear message to the government of Ukraine, to respect these democratic freedoms and work with our allies to support a political resolution to the crisis. Of course, this situation has arisen as a result of the disappointing decision of the Ukrainian government to suspend negotiations for an association agreement and deep and comprehensive free trade with the European Union as was already noted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531448">Soon after the announcement of this decision, as the protests were just getting going, I issued a statement on behalf of the New Democratic Party on November 25, expressing our concern and urging all sides to exercise restraint and for the government to do that as well, and to commit to a dialogue between government and opposition parties and civil society. Unfortunately, as we saw, the Ukrainian government did not follow through on those demands, which many of us were making, did not show restraint. In fact, it did the opposite.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3531449">Of course, we are deeply concerned with the continued police crackdowns, which have reportedly included the use of tear gas, stun grenades, and batons against peaceful protesters, bystanders, and journalists. This must end, and we must speak clearly and with unanimity in this place to condemn the violence that we have seen against peaceful protest. We deplore these attacks on peaceful assembly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531450">There are numerous reports of injuries and arbitrary political arrests. These actions by Ukrainian security services are simply unacceptable, and they must prosecuted. Ukrainian authorities must not only refrain from violence, which is obvious, but must respect the democratic freedoms of the Ukrainian people. The government must also respect due process and fundamental justice for all who may be detained, and the rule of law must reign supreme.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531451">The use of divisive rhetoric against the protesters by the Ukrainian government has aggravated tensions and undermined democratic discourse. Dialogue among Ukrainians, supported by the international community, is essential for reconciliation and democratic progress in Ukraine. The actions of the Ukrainian government have put this process at risk. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531452">Let us be clear: all Canadian political parties are united in their desire for a free, democratic, and prosperous Ukraine. Last year, on the foreign affairs committee, as the vice-chair working with my colleagues, we studied the situation in Ukraine. I was pleased that the committee recommended that the Government of Canada should call for the prompt release of all political leaders who have been convicted as part of apparently politically motivated prosecutions. This is incredibly important for any democracy. There cannot be free and fair elections when opposition leaders are imprisoned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531453">The committee also called on the Ukrainian government to strengthen the rule of law, respect for human rights, media freedom, religious freedom, and academic freedom. At the time, the NDP also added its supplementary report, which called for any economic negotiations between Canada and Ukraine to be coordinated with demands that elections be free, fair, and transparent in accordance with international standards, along with the release of all politicians who had been convicted as part of apparently politically motivated prosecutions. We also recommended that Canada should coordinate its actions with the European Union. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531454">Now is another opportunity for such coordination. Catherine Ashton, the EU's foreign representative—and this is news I received just before I came to the House—is there. She has actually been to Independence Square and has met with people in the square, as well as with government officials. We are also hearing about talks with the opposition leaders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531455">Canada has a very strong relationship, as we know, and that strong relationship can be used for the benefit of the Ukrainian people. The government should use our status and the strong ties with Ukraine to push for change at the top. This is international Human Rights Day. It was 65 years ago today that a Canadian-inspired document, the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, was adopted. Let us be inspired to carry that mission through when it comes to the people of Ukraine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531456">I want to finish where I started. This is about a dream of a people. We have a responsibility to see that dream through. We have a responsibility to make sure that the people of Ukraine know that the Canadian people are with them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531457">Let me finish by simply saying <I>slava Ukraini</I>.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531459">We are deeply concerned by the news reports that we see emerging from Ukraine. We are concerned about the brutal treatment of the demonstrators, where ordinary human rights seem to be totally disregarded. We are concerned as well about the offices of political parties being raided and ransacked. This is a very troubling situation, and that is why we are having this special debate tonight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531460">I wonder if the hon. member would agree that it is important for Canada, with its international partners the United States, the European Union, and elsewhere, to pursue all means by which we can apply appropriate diplomatic pressure to bring about a change in attitude with the Yanukovych regime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531461">I am thinking particularly of the way in which that regime—the president himself, members of his government, the oligarchs that support him—seem to be able to carry out these actions to which we object with complete impunity. They have a disregard for the rule of law, a disregard for human rights, and a disregard for democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531462">Would it be possible for Canada to lead an initiative in the world that would bring the United States, European countries, and others together to develop a set of specific actions that would not be focused against Ukraine as a country or focused against the Ukrainian people, but would be focused directly against Yanukovych, his henchmen, and the oligarchs who back him up to make sure that they cannot enjoy their wealth, their assets, their ability to travel with impunity without regard to what they are doing to their own people back home?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531465">Very smart things that we can do, and some of the things that our party has already called for, include engagement. We are hearing that this is absolutely critical. I was glad to see the <Affiliation DbId="170677" Type="4">foreign affairs minister </Affiliation>go to Ukraine recently, and we have to keep that up. First is engagement with our allies by the government so that we do not see Ukraine slip back into the pocket of Russia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531466">Second, we can call upon Ukraine's president to respect the freedom of its citizens to assemble peacefully. We can call upon Ukraine's authorities to respect this right and to apply restraint in interaction with peaceful protestors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531467">Third, we can demand that the governing authorities of Ukraine respect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all Ukrainians, release from jail all peaceful protestors, and refrain from the use of force, as I had mentioned. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531468">I will quickly enumerate the other points that the UCC has mentioned. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531469">One is to reiterate the firm commitment of Canada to Ukraine's European integration and the signing of the EU-Ukraine association agreement on the basis of the clear, united, and undeniable call of the people of Ukraine as manifested by the people of Ukraine as they are speaking right now in Independence Square. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531470">Another is to develop a sound policy and plan to address Russia's violations of its international commitments, particularly the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances in connection with Ukraine's accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. This is very important. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531471">Another, in concert with the U.S. and European authorities, is to play a leadership role in the G8 and the G20. This point gets back to the question I was posed. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531474">I had the privilege, as the member is aware, of travelling to Ukraine a year and a half ago as part of a foreign affairs delegation. We were precisely looking into these matters. There were concerns with the erosion of democracy and the rule of law in Ukraine and whether or not there would be a fair election. The election was held last October. Of course, we are into elections again. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531475">In the feedback we were given, in addition to what the Ukrainian Canadian Congress is calling for, we had strong presentations from civil society and the media calling for more support by the Canadian government—for example, through CIDA—to enable young Ukrainians to come for visits here and to provide more internships, and also for visits by people working in municipal governments. They have not had a democratic regime for long. They do not have the experience of observing and being part of a democratic regime. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531476">I have not yet heard mention of strong support for freedom of the media.

              <ParaText id="3531478">Mr. Chair, that is a superb question. That is why these take note debates are really important. We can discuss ideas, put proposals forward, and have a good discussion when we have more than 35 seconds. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531479">It is really important that we focus on the media. These elections were not fair because the ability of everyday people to get their message out was being controlled by the media. It was the same with the incarceration of political opposition leaders. There cannot be a full debate if people are restricted because they are incarcerated, obviously. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531480">However, what my colleague from Edmonton said that is equally important is that Canada can help with democratic development here by supporting civic development through exchanges. We have seen young bright people here in the internship program, for instance. We should be doing more of that. We should be opening our doors to all those young people who believe in that dream I was talking about. That way, the dream cannot be stolen, because they are going to be equipped with the right skill sets to go back and build up their communities at the civic level and the municipal level as well as at the state level. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531481">However, we need to see the media question put on the front burner, because we have seen a restriction of freedom of speech and a clampdown on media that are not in line with the government's party line. These are very important initiatives, and we can help by funding those projects in Ukraine and inviting those young, bright, talented Ukrainians to come here to learn how we do things. Then they can bring that back home. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531482">Mr. Chair, I appreciate the discussion that is taking place tonight. I want to ask my colleague a couple of questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531483">I actually had the chance to be at the Vilnius summit and to see the disappointment that was so obvious there that Ukraine would not be signing the agreement. Three opposition leaders were actually there and hosted a panel. Two of the things they talked about were, one, the importance of making sure that the demonstrations and their opposition to the government's position were done peacefully and, two, the real need for them to be working together, not separately. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531484">I would be interested first in the member's comments on the necessity for the opposition in Ukraine to work together. Second, we have had some differences across the House in terms of the importance of integrated trade deals and those kinds of things. How does his party see the importance of the EU-Ukraine integration agreement?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3531485">Mr. Chair, to be clear, it is more than a trade agreement; it is a political agreement as well. The strategic partnership agreement framework that the EU has, which we have not signed on to yet, I might note, is an important model. Actually, the agreement with Ukraine is even bigger than the strategic partnership agreements that they normally negotiate along with their trade agreements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531486"> We need to see this happen because we know what is happening right now. We have a president who is pulling Ukraine away from Europe towards Russia. We know the people do not want that. We have to show that we are interested in Ukraine having full and open access to the west through the European Union. We support this political economic agreement that the president walked away from and is playing games with, as members know. There is no question about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531487">We believe it is important for the opposition to unite around a similar position. That is where we can help. As we speak, I note that Ms. Ashton is there from the EU, engaging diplomatically. Hopefully, we will see a change of mind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531488">I would also note, just off the BBC wire, that we now have the president saying he might go to Brussels next week. Well, would that not be interesting?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531489">We cannot turn our backs. We have to turn the pressure up. On this side, we believe in that political economic arrangement. We believe we should be pushing for it and that we should see a united opposition. We believe we should be doing everything we can with our diplomatic muscle to encourage that engagement with the EU, absolutely one hundred per cent.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531490">Mr. Chair, I do believe it is a very important debate, and I appreciate the opportunity to express a few thoughts and share some ideas that the Liberal Party has come up with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531491">In Canada, it is estimated that we have over 1.2 million people of Ukrainian heritage. There are literally hundreds of thousands of people who are watching every day as to what is taking place in Ukraine. They care about the future of Ukraine. Whether it is the person on the street or individuals here inside the chamber, that caring attitude is there and it is very real.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531492">I know the foreign affairs critic has had communications with organizations such as the Ukrainian Canadian Congress. We have been kept fully informed of what people from our communities are saying, whether it has been the leader of the Liberal Party or the member for <Affiliation DbId="170466" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation>, and even our new member for <Affiliation DbId="199815" Type="2">Toronto Centre</Affiliation>, who has also been addressing this issue that she feels quite passionate about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531493">I want to start with an event that I attended. The member for <Affiliation DbId="170466" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation> spoke on it, and it was dealing with the issue of the Holodomor, an issue that anyone of Ukrainian heritage, and many more, recognize as a genocide of sorts that occurred during the 1930s. I say it for this one specific reason; I want to be able to quote something that was being circulated at the 80th anniversary. The booklet states, in reference to the Holodomor:</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531495">This was written by Semen Rak, a Holodomor survivor. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531496">I have had the opportunity to see the memorial in Kiev that is featured on the brochure that was being circulated for the recognition of the 80th anniversary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531497"> I understand and appreciate the resilience of Ukrainian people. Through that resilience, we have something that is happening today, and we recognize what happened in the past, the whole orange wave, the Orange Revolution that was made reference to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531498"> All of that has had a very profound impact on a population in Ukraine that so many here in Canada are following and want to see some sort of positive resolve. We need to come up with ideas and suggestions as to what will ultimately go a long way toward bringing more peace and harmony, thinking, of course, of the importance of issues like the rule of law, democracy and human rights. These are all fundamental principles that we believe are important for everyone throughout the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531499">We have seen the carrot dangled in front of Ukrainians for many years, and at times we have seen huge steps forward indicating that Ukraine is on the right track. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531500">I believe that when President Yanukovych decided not to move forward with the EU agreements, we saw a reaction from the population. The population reacted virtually immediately. We saw protests in the square in downtown Kiev in front of government buildings, a square that I personally have had the opportunity to be in. I am very familiar with the surroundings and the emotions that no doubt would be flowing.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="55">(1855)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3531501">These are the types of responses that we have seen, even in the cold and miserable weather at times. People have taken to the streets, not only in Kiev, but in Lviv, smaller cities and in the countryside. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531502">The people of Ukraine are concerned about the future of their country. We are so blessed here in Canada that we take a lot of things for granted. However, we do have something to offer. Whether they are constituents living in Winnipeg North, in Regina, Toronto or wherever it might be, people are following this, and they want parliamentarians to assist in whatever way we can. A part of that means listening to the communities we represent. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531503">That is why the Ukrainian Canadian Congress has played a very strong leadership in informing members of Parliament. I compliment individuals like Taras Zalusky and Paul Grod for the excellent and wonderful job they have done in ensuring that whether a member is the leader of the Liberal Party, members like myself, members of the Conservative Party or the New Democratic Party, we are kept abreast of their point of view on what is actually taking place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531504">There are many other individuals whom I have had the opportunity to talk with. I can tell the House that there is a consensus forming, which is that we need to emphasize how important it is that Ukraine respects the importance of restraint. It has to allow people to vent their ideas and their positions when things occur, respect peaceful rallies and allow people to get together to protest in a peaceful fashion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531505">We have to look at where there have already been allegations of serious violations of human rights. There needs to be some sort of investigation that is legitimate and shows we are respecting human rights. From what I understand, we know there has already been some armed intervention on some of the protests. We need to be concerned about that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531506">We have to be very much aware of the importance of democracy. We have to do what we can to encourage it. We feel very strongly and passionately. I, for one, have had the opportunity to visit and monitor an election at the grassroots level, particularly in Lviv during the last election. The people there value democracy. They value the economic opportunities that could be there for them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531507">It does not mean that Russia does not have a role to play. It means that we have to recognize that the European Union also has a role to play in the future of Ukraine. Even Canada has a role to play in looking at potential Ukraine-Canada trade agreements. Obviously, it would be with caveats that deal with things such as human rights and democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531508">These are things that we need to look at. We need to maintain the issue of engagement with the different levels of government, whether it is with universities, municipalities, national governments or the many different links that are there. As I said, 1.2 million people of Ukrainian heritage call Canada home. Many of them have family, brothers, sisters, nephews, nieces and so on, who live in Ukraine today. We need to maintain and enhance those communications.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3531510">Mr. Chair, I rise today with a very heavy heart and great concern for the people of Ukraine. I come from a consistency where probably a third of my constituents are from Ukrainian heritage and many kept contact, even through the darkness of the Soviet period when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union. They kept contact, maintained relationships and sent care packages to their families in Ukraine. That has been sustained and today they still feel an extremely close connection with their country of origin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531511">I feel great concern because not only has President Yanukovych put in place a customs union with Russia, which, in itself, would not be a bad thing, it would be a good thing, but that he has ended negotiations on the association agreement with the European Union. That is what really leads to a concern.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531512">I have a question for my colleague. My friends and neighbours, who have now become my family through marriage, in the constituency are concerned that what is happening in Ukraine may be a re-Sovietization of the area, that what is happening may be the start of a movement to an expansion on the part of Russia to a new Soviet-style regime. We do not know how far that would go or whether that would happen. We all hope and pray that it would not. Is it beyond the realm of possibility? Sadly, I fear not. I think it is possible and I hope and pray that it is not the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531513">I want to ask my colleague whether he sees a danger that this movement could be the start of a process that could, in fact, lead to that tragic outcome.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531514">Mr. Chair, I do not necessarily want to play up on the fear. There are people across Canada who are virtually in tears because of what they see taking place in Ukraine today. The sense that we need to do something exists. It is very real and tangible. I believe it goes far beyond even the Ukrainian community or people of Ukrainian heritage. If we care about what is happening in Europe, about democracy, the rule of law, human rights and we want to see the Ukrainian people to move forward, we cannot help wanting to get engaged in this. It is causing people, as I say, in many regions to break down into tears because they are fearful of the direction we might be going in. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531515">There are two things that we have to maintain. One is the idea of engagement, which is critically important. The other thing is what we can do that can have a very real message or tangible result. I loved when the member for <Affiliation DbId="170466" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation>, for example, talked about not punishing the Ukrainian people and pointed to the president. Is there some way we can prevent him from travelling anywhere in the world, create some sort of sanctions or something else that could be done? We need to approach this with an open mind in an apolitical fashion and see what pressure we can apply. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531518">Mr. Chair, I suspect we will find that many economists will say that the economic opportunities will be greatly enhanced by a European trade agreement with Ukraine for the simple reasons that there are really two trading partners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531519">There is Russia, which makes up a huge portion of trade with Ukraine, and there is that vested interest there. On the other hand, there is the European Union, which is growing by huge amounts. I could not say how many millions off hand, but I do know from discussions with people when I was in Kiev, in particular, that they were very optimistic that the future in getting freer trade with the European Union was going to enable all sorts of economic opportunities and prosperity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531520">At the same time, I do not believe that people want to get rid of the trade that is happening in Russia, but there seems to be a lot more optimism in terms of the freer trade with the European Union.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531522">Mr. Chair, while we are meeting tonight, news reports out of Kiev indicate that large numbers of police are once again moving closer to the Maidan. There is no action yet. However, there appears to be large numbers descending on Independence Square and the risk of violence is obviously in the air. That will be of great concern to a great many Canadians, the 1.25 million Canadians who can trace their heritage to Ukraine, 13% of the population of the province of Saskatchewan and even more so, I think, in the province of Alberta.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531523">This is a very troubling situation. We need the means to get the attention of President Yanukovych so he knows the world is watching, the world is deeply concerned and the world is not prepared to turn away or to turn its back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531524">That is why I make the suggestion of trying to bring together the international community in an effort to develop a set of very targeted, very specific Yanukovych sanctions that are aimed at him, not at the country, not at the people, but at him so he is not free to use his assets with impugnity, he is not free to travel with impugnity and that the world will hold him to account for how he is handling this situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531525">I wonder if my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170750" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> could indicate his view on that specific suggestion. Canada could not do this alone, but we could in concert with other countries. I do think it would be useful for Canada to start that international dialogue so President Yanukovych will understand very clearly that the world treats this situation in a very serious manner and there will be consequences for behaviour that violates human rights, democracy and the rule of law.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531531">We are very special partners, Canada and Ukraine, and in over 20 years we have worked very hard together. Canada has been mentioned many times as home to 1.2 million Canadians of Ukrainian heritage and that includes my own mother-in-law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531532">In 2011, we celebrated the 120th anniversary of the first Ukrainian Canadian settlement in Canada. We are very proud of that achievement, very proud of what the Canadian Ukrainians have produced and have contributed to our history and to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531533">Recently in the House we commemorated the 80th anniversary of Holomodor, one of the worst, most heinous genocides, the murder of millions by famine by Josef Stalin and the Soviet Communist totalitarian state in 1932-33.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531534">However, on December 2, 1991, Canada became the first western nation to recognize Ukraine's independence from the Soviet Union. Since then we have invested $410 million of official assistance in Ukraine and we are still providing $20 million a year in technical assistance to advance democracy and the rule of law. We have drawn bilateral road maps and we continue on with free trade negotiations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531535">Canada is very engaged with Ukraine. We will not disengage with Ukraine because it is very important that we maintain that engagement to be able to influence the events within Ukraine. In fact, last year we sent over 500 election observers to Ukraine, the most ever. I was part of that as were a few members of the House who participated in that. In fact, we are also sending over 25 election observers later this week. I will be one of those to go over and monitor those rerun elections.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531536">Ukrainians are rejecting their Soviet past and instead want to embrace western ideals of freedom, democracy, human rights, the rule of law and balanced justice. That is what the people in the Maidan are trying to say. They are fighting for their futures. They are fighting for hope. They are fighting for freedom and democracy. The people of Ukraine only want what people everywhere want. They want their kids to go to school. They want their kids to get a good education. They want their kids to have a great opportunity for jobs and a future and prosperity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531537">There is no reason that the nation of Ukraine cannot be one of the great nations of Europe today. Ukraine has the size. It has the potential to grow food. It has been the breadbasket of Europe. It has minerals. It has enough energy to create its own wealth. It just needs the opportunity to do that and to be able to catch up with its neighbours. It wants a vibrant civil society. For example, Ukraine's neighbours like Poland, is Ukraine's best friend in the world right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531538"> I commend the Poles for everything that they have done for Ukraine. I commend Mr. Cox and Mr. Kwasniewski for their multiple repeated visits to Ukraine on behalf of the EU and pulling Ukraine toward the EU and to Europe. I commend all the work that the EU has done. I commend the work that Sweden has done as well in being able to help Ukraine move that way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531539">We have engaged Ukraine on many levels, including free trade negotiations and we hope to resume those free trade negotiations because Ukraine has the capacity to be a great nation and we would very much like to see them achieve that and see them become a partner of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531540">That is why events in Ukraine are so tragic. This EU association agreement that has been rejected is the same agreement that has been provided, as I said, to Poland, Estonia, Lithuania and others in the mid-nineties. It is an agreement that allowed those nations to achieve tremendous prosperity. In fact, Poland is one of the fastest growing EU countries right now economically. It is in fact often referred to as the Canada of Europe. Poland has tried very hard to assist Ukraine in being able to sign this deal and come over. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531541">Many of us have had Canada-Ukraine parliamentary program interns who have worked for us over the many years. I have had three since I have been a member of the House of Commons. These kids are bright, smart, talented, ambitious and they want opportunity and they want to do it in their home country. They want to go home and they want to lead. These kids do not want to leave for other nations in Europe, they want to go home to Europe and they want to stand up and they want to contribute to the prosperity of their nation, in the bosom of their families, in their towns. That is what they want.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531543">It is Russia that is making this an us-or-them proposition. It is Mr. Putin who is unfairly leveraging Ukraine with the hold he has on Ukraine right now with Gazprom and the other trade levers he is pulling. There is no reason Ukraine cannot trade with the European Union and trade with Russia. There is absolutely no reason why this has to be an us-or-them proposition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531544"> Ukraine should be able to have the freedom to choose who it trades with around the world. It could make trade arrangements with the TPP, perhaps, in the future, or other trade blocs or partners, for mutual benefit. That strengthens the economy and jobs. It allows people to prosper. That allows a nation to develop itself in a democratic, free, and fair way. There is absolutely no reason the Ukraine should be put in a corner where it has to choose one or the other. It is not fair. It is not necessary. In fact, it is a form of blackmail, and it is unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531545">Ukraine has a long way to go. For example, in the area of justice, selective justice is unacceptable. Yulia Tymoshenko is still in jail, and there is no reason for that. Part of the deal with the EU was that she might be pardoned, or at the very least, sent to Germany for medical treatment. She is in very bad medical condition with her back. I call on Mr. Yanukovych to show clemency and allow Mrs. Tymoshenko to travel to Germany for the medical treatment she badly needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531546">The member for <Affiliation DbId="170466" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation> mentioned earlier that he just got a tweet about security forces moving into the square in Kiev. This is very disturbing. I would like Mr. Yanukovych to know that the world is watching. These people in the square only want freedom, democracy, human rights, rule of law, balanced justice, and an economy they can rely on. This is not happening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531547">If there is further violence in the Maidan, Canada is watching. Europe is watching. The United States is watching. All the world is watching. This will fall at the feet of Mr. Yanukovych if there is tragedy at the Maidan because of any orders he or his government give to harm any of those protesters. If there is further bloodshed, it is on his hands. We are watching, and the world will hold him accountable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531548">When the Parliamentary Chairman from Ukraine, Mr. Rybak, and his delegation were here two weeks ago leading the Canada-Ukraine Parliamentary Friendship Group, we told them that they were wrong, wrong, wrong to reject the EU association deal. It was the wrong course of action. Some members of the Party of Regions outlined to me the deal they had with Gazprom. My reply to them was this: “What is the matter with you if you are prepared to sign a deal with a country that is siphoning billions of dollars out of the Ukrainian economy and denying the people of Ukraine the economic prosperity they need? Why would you sign an agreement with people like that?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531549"> Mr. Putin can have one word with Gazprom and they could realign that gas deal. That is not happening. They are just being leveraged and put in a corner where they have to choose one or the other.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531550">What is happening to Ukraine is wrong, wrong, wrong. Canada is watching. Canada will remain engaged with Ukraine and will stand with its Ukrainian diaspora here in Canada to make sure that Ukraine follows the path of freedom and democracy. All Canadians and all members of this House are unified in standing with the Ukrainian people.</ParaText>

That would be the Maidan square. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531553">Ukrainians in Canada have been very concerned about the use of force and the government there not allowing the right to democratic protest, the right to free speech, and the ability to gather in this public square. There is great concern about the use of force in breaking up these demonstrations and about undue pressure being put on those demonstrators gathered in Maidan square. A number of students were arrested earlier, and there is concern about their treatment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531554">I ask the member if the government is sending an urgent message, especially this evening, as we are having this debate, that the government refrain from trying to remove the peaceful protesters and that it stop any undue force so that people's rights to free assembly and free speech are respected. That ought to be a basic right as we celebrate the 65th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531560">I wonder if the hon. member could advise the House on the state of communication between Canada and a number of allies. I am thinking about allies in Europe, other than the Ukraine, the United States, and other parts of the world. We share a common concern about the deterioration of events in Ukraine. How well are we communicating with our allies and potential allies? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531561">Do we have the capacity, perhaps under Canadian leadership, to pull together a group of like-minded countries to develop a specific action plan for what we could do to have a very real impact on the behaviour of President Yanukovych? He seems to be able to act with impunity and sort of thumb his nose at world opinion. It is important that the message be driven home to him in a way that does not damage the Ukrainian people or the economy of the Ukraine. It needs to be driven home to him directly that this behaviour is unacceptable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531562">The world is watching, and there will be consequences if, for example, there is bloodshed or violence in the Maidan.</ParaText>

In fact, as I mentioned, the <Affiliation DbId="170677" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> was just in Ukraine with the other ministers from the OSCE. Many of those ministers, including our own Minister of Foreign Affairs, walked through the Maidan and talked to the protestors, opposition groups, and demonstrators. He told them in no uncertain terms that Canada supports them. That has been made very clear. As to communications from here, what is said in this House tonight will be in that square in minutes. I would like to assure the hon. member of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531564">We cannot, of course, tell members what other nations are going to do. Canada can only say what we are going to do. However, we do co-operate with all of our allies. We do suggest courses of action to all of our allies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531565">Canada will be watching very closely and communicating what we think to the Ukrainian government. Mr. Yanukovych, I believe, is starting to feel the world pressure, because as this mounts, all eyes are on him. He will be responsible for what happens in Ukraine. Whether he allows freedom and democracy to flourish and the economy to flourish will be up to Mr. Yanukovych. However, if he continues to drift toward authoritarian rule, I think, on the world stage, woe be to him.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531572">Mr. Chair, I am honoured to rise this evening to participate in this debate on the situation in Ukraine, which is incredibly troubling and urgent as Ukrainians live through this crisis. The world is clearly engaged and watching what is happening in Ukraine and I am very thankful that we are having this debate tonight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531573">I want to first say, as firmly as I can, working closely with my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170296" Type="2">Ottawa Centre</Affiliation> who is the NDP official opposition critic on international issues, that New Democrats stand firmly with the people of Ukraine in their hour of need. We are with them, we are here in solidarity and we support them in their struggle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531574">I want to pick up on what others have said here tonight. I believe all parties in the House are of one mind and one voice when it comes to support for the people of Ukraine in the situation they are in this evening. We are very concerned about the current crisis, the use of force against protesters, the denial of free speech and the increasingly eastward drift of Ukraine, turning away from the west and increasingly, we believe, turning away from democratic engagement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531575">I am very fortunate, as the member of Parliament for Parkdale—High Park, that I represent a very large Ukrainian Canadian diaspora and I am very proud that this community has stayed together so tightly and has such a strong culture. People have preserved their language, their art, their community and their engagement with what is happening in Ukraine, as well as contributing for generations to the building of our country, Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531576">I am very honoured that I have had the opportunity to work with the Ukrainian Canadian community and have come to understand the difficult, troubled history that Ukrainians have faced in their country, everything from dictatorship and the suppression of rights to the ultimate horror of the Holodomor in 1932-33, the famine genocide. It is absolutely unbelievable what the Ukrainian community has had to suffer and I am very proud that it is our country, Canada, that was the first to recognize the Holodomor as a genocide and has worked so closely with the Ukrainian community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531577">Because of the experience I have had in Parkdale—High Park, I have used that opportunity to engage with Ukrainian people. I first went to Ukraine as an election observer in 2004 during the Orange Revolution. Yes, I was in the Maidan square and it was this time of year. It was very cold, but the energy, emotion and passion of Ukrainians as they jammed into that square was absolutely palpable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531578">Of course, we were neutral election observers. We were there to observe, but I was sent to Zaporizhia, which was an all-night train ride into the central eastern part of Ukraine. We arrived exactly at 6 a.m. on December 25. It was an incredible experience. The reason we were there was that the presidential elections were deemed fraudulent and were being rerun. There had been a huge initiative undertaken to train all of those who were participating as staff in the election and the people who volunteered. I saw first-hand how passionately Ukrainians wanted the democratic process to work. I believe in that case it did work, because the results were overturned. They elected a different president and there was so much hope in the aftermath of those elections. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531579">I had the opportunity to return to Ukraine twice after that to be part of subsequent elections, most recently in 2012 for the parliamentary election. There are some re-runoffs of those elections taking place in the near future.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="35">(1935)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3531580">I have seen first-hand the passion of the Ukrainian people, who want what they have described to me as a normal country, a normal society and a normal democracy. Normal means that opposition leaders do not get jailed right before an election. They do not get hauled off to trial on trumped up charges and then thrown in jail so they cannot participate in elections. Normal means the media does not get completely controlled in the months running up to an election. It means that people have the opportunity to freely and peacefully demonstrate and engage in their society. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531581">I want to thank the many colleagues in the House who have been part of these observer missions and who have worked on the Canada-Ukraine parliamentary friendship committee. This is so important. I also want to thank those involved in the internship program. Through this program, I have seen first-hand, in my office here in Ottawa, smart, educated, talented young people from Ukraine, full of hope, who want to learn, who want to build their country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531582">I have so much hope for the future of Ukraine, yet here we are in these dark times right now debating the situation, all because the Ukraine government turned its back on its negotiations and its long-standing opportunity to form a trade partnership with the EU after years of negotiations. President Yanukovych turned his back on this and instead, when protestors start filling the streets in Kiev, he cracked down on them. He sent in the armed police who threw people in jail and beat people. That is not the way a democracy ought to function. Young people know better and that is why they are standing up against this brutality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531583">We are all here tonight with Ukraine. We have to ensure that whatever actions we or the international community take, there is engagement. We need not do anything that further isolates Ukraine. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531584">I want to commend the <Affiliation DbId="170677" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> for his recent trip to Ukraine and meeting with the protestors and engaging with the government. I believe we cannot just criticize Ukraine. We have to engage with it, but exert pressure as we engage also with civil society. With all of the work we have done, sending more election observers than any other country, we have the opportunity and we have the obligation to engage with Ukraine and advocate for it on the international stage. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531585">We do have to call on the president of Ukraine to respect the rights of the citizens of Ukraine, to respect democratic assembly, to respect free speech, to respect the right of people to have fair and free elections and to respect their desire when the majority of Ukrainians want to have engagement with the west. We want to urge the government to allow that to happen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531586">We support the engagement of Ukraine with the European Union. We think that is a positive development. We also need to put pressure on Russia because we believe its undue meddling in Ukraine's affairs is really behind what is happening. We believe this is in violation of treaties that Russia has committed to in terms of submitting Ukraine to economic pressure. It needs to cease and desist from doing that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531587">There are many other measures that we support. We support the Ukrainian Canadian Congress's demands for a crackdown on money laundering and corrupt business practices. We support the desire of Ukrainians who come to Canada to have greater access to visas and an accelerated process.</ParaText>

We want to encourage them to reach out to engage with the opposition, and to find a way forward so that the democratic will of the people is represented and the democratic aspirations of this country can be fully recognized.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531599">I think there is good will around the world for this to happen. We can reach out to the government of Ukraine and urge it to pull back from its suppression of demonstrators, and reach out to them instead to engage in dialogue.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531600">Mr. Chair, again I note the sense of unanimity in the House tonight, among all members on all sides, with respect to the situation in Ukraine, and the deep concern we all feel with news reports tonight that riot police have taken some action in the Maidan and that water cannon may have been used and other forms of suppression. Some of the tents apparently have been torn down. At the moment, the situation may not have turned a corner to severe violence, but the risk is certainly there and that troubles us all deeply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531601">I think we all agree with the point that the member for <Affiliation DbId="170382" Type="2">Parkdale—High Park</Affiliation> has made, and the minister referred to this, about finding the means to seek engagement and encourage dialogue and get the government and the opposition in Ukraine talking to each other in civil terms toward constructive solutions. One of the big problems seems to be getting President Yanukovych's attention. He seems to be prepared to act with impunity, perhaps because he believes there will be no consequences for him. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531602">I wonder if the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170382" Type="2">Parkdale—High Park</Affiliation> could share some of her thoughts about how to get Yanukovych's attention. Other than rhetorically criticizing his behaviour, how, in a tangible way, can we bring this man to understand that the world is watching, the world is deeply concerned, and that there will be consequences for behaviour that violates civil rights, democracy and the rule of law?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531610">Mr. Chair, my colleague is absolutely right. Ukraine does have a constitution. It does provide protection against human rights abuses, and I think that is an excellent idea. Canada engages with Ukraine on so many levels, whether it is with business, with education, with civil society. Given our history around human rights protection, and, again, the 65th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, perhaps there is a way for us to reach out and provide some legislative support to help ensure its constitution is enforced, given what seems to be a situation of massive human rights abuses. I thank her for that suggestion.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3531611">Mr. Chair, it is a great pleasure for me to take part in this debate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531612">I have had an opportunity with some of my colleagues here to attend Ukraine's elections, on two occasions. I have had the opportunity to see the desire that the people have for democracy and the rule of law. Certainly it has been a struggle, and I appreciate that there are many aspects to it and that it is more complex than we can sometimes see. However, overall, the desire is to go forward. There have been obstacles along the way in many situations, but the desire is always for this to go forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531613">The situation, of course, has deteriorated over the last little while. It is understandable that many Ukrainian people are disappointed with the negative direction the government took most recently when it turned its back on signing the EU-Ukrainian association agreement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531614">I think the Ukrainian Canadian Congress stated it quite well when they said that this “puts a stop to reform and the path of European integration and the modernization of the Ukrainian economy to put in line with the international standards. It further impedes the path to democracy and protection of human rights”. There is no question about that, and I think that is sort of the central core of the upset by the people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531615">The Ukrainian Canadian Congress also expressed disappointment, as it has become clear that Ukraine's President Viktor Yushchenko arrived in Vilnius without any intention to reach an agreement. They say this is extremely disappointing and counter to the formal position taken by the government of Ukraine, the Parliament of Ukraine and the expressed will of the Ukrainian people, who have taken to the streets across Ukraine to peacefully demonstrate their opposition. They know instinctively that the president was heading in a direction that was taking Ukraine further away from the free and democratic nation that they desire and expect for Ukraine, a nation governed by justice and the rule of law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531616">Many see this direction as a regressive step at a pivotal time in the nation's history. As one young demonstrator stated, “I don't want to go back to what my parents lived under the Soviet Union. When I am old, I want to live like people in Europe. I want to live in a normal country”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531617">The pressures on the president to align with Russia may well have been great, especially given the fact that Ukraine's economy has been in recession for more than a year and the government is in desperate need of funding to avoid default. No doubt, Moscow has worked aggressively to derail the agreement with the EU. However, this must be resisted at all costs by the people of Ukraine and must be taken into account by western democracies and other countries in the world to work with Ukraine to help it see its way through this current financial crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531618">Most Ukrainians would agree that a signed agreement would provide a baseline for Ukraine's reforms, with guidelines for Ukraine's development by changes in Ukraine's legal system, a stop of the misuse of courts for persecuting political opposition leaders, and observing at least some elementary and rudimentary rules of law and basic democratic standards. An independent and impartial judiciary is the essence of a democratic society governed by the rule of law. Justice must not only be done, but it must also be seen to be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531619">Fundamentally, I found it remarkable that one of the most likely contenders in the political elections was charged and convicted prior to the elections on what would appear to be politically motivated actions, and here I am speaking of Yulia Tymoshenko, former prime minister. It is remarkable that political losers end up in prison.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531620">As many have stated, this is symbolic of Ukraine's clinging to the Soviet past. Anyone looking at the situation objectively would find it remarkable to see political opposition members tried, sentenced and jailed to remove them from political contests. Another arrest relating to Yuri Lutsenko, Ukraine's former interior minister, also raised the same concerns. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531621">I would say this is a pivotal time in Ukraine's history and choices must be made. The people have made that choice by taking part in the demonstrations in the streets throughout Ukraine. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="00">(2000)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3531622">Many in Canada have supported that action, through demonstrations taking place in Montreal, Ottawa, Winnipeg, Regina and other places. However, it was those who gathered in Kiev's Independence Square who ended up being targeted by government forces. They were there simply and peaceably expressing their desire to integrate into the European Union. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531623">Many see the suspension of continued discussion as a signal that the current leadership is veering away from the ideals, goals and aspirations of most Ukrainians, particularly the youth. It is no wonder, then, that we have seen many people out on the streets demonstrating.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531624">During the three weeks of protests against Yanukovych's decision to align with Russia, police violently dispersed demonstrators twice, and went even further by storming the office of the top opposition party, breaking glass and reportedly smashing doors. This kind of action is simply unacceptable. It is intolerable. It must cease and desist. It is unacceptable to have peaceful demonstrators seriously injured. That is just a fact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531625">The Ukrainian Canadian Congress was deeply disappointed, and denounced the government's decision to stop the process of preparing for the conclusion of the association agreement between Ukraine and the EU and to resume an act of dialogue with the Russian Federation and other countries of the customs union. It said that this unilateral decision by the Government of Ukraine does not further the cause of the Ukrainian people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531626">When I was there, I saw how the electoral system works, some of the changes that had been made and the actions of President Yanukovych's government. What option do the Ukrainian people have but to protest? The human spirit at some point is prepared to resist wrong simply because it is wrong, no matter what the cost. We have seen good upstanding people, who otherwise might not have been involved and who are not be easily moved, who are prepared to take that stand at some point. That point is here now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531627">The action that the authorities should take in response to this is to change their direction, to take popular discontent into account, and to take reasonable steps to ensure that peaceful gatherings are not broken up and that the participants are not injured or incarcerated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531628">It was interesting, and to some measure good, to see a news release where President Viktor Yanukovych promised that some demonstrators arrested in the massive protest sweeping the capital would be released. In that news release, he vowed to renew talks with the European Union, talking to others within the country on concluding a much awaited trade and political agreement. He also said that he was still up to signing the deal at a summit in spring, but only if the EU could offer better financial terms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531629">This is talk, and perhaps rhetoric, that needs to be backed up by action. However, it is the kind of dialogue that needs to take place. It is the kind of response that needs to happen. Many times when we reach a crossroads or a certain turning point, the end result is uncertain. It is important during those times to be watchful and helpful to a situation that could possibly resolve itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531630">To the participants of the demonstrations, it is a time to be encouraged as each of them takes their stand. They are certainly beacons of light during a dark moment in Ukraine's history. In making their point, they are making their mark, and they are being noticed here in Canada and in other parts of the world. They are on the side of right, and history will show it to be so. Although they do not know the full impact of what they are doing now, know that their actions, words and stand have already changed the situation so that it may never be the same again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531631">I would say “Take courage. Do not despair. Continue to stand and continue to speak true words that will echo truth into the generations to come”. It is through actions like the ones they have taken that change and results will come. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531632">We can only hope in the House that the end result will be better for it.</ParaText>

I am watching several live online feeds as the people in the crowd and on stage are praying and calling on the police to show restraint and to stand on the protester's side. Despite these calls the police continue to clear the Square. I ask you all to pray for the peaceful protesters. We as Canadians cannot stand idle.

              <ParaText id="3531639">Mr. Chair, as I said previously, we need more than just words on the part of the government and the president: we need some action, and not of the type that we are seeing today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531640">Freedom of association, freedom of speech and the freedom to make a point or express one's point by demonstrating, as these demonstrators have peaceably done, are fundamental rights and values that any democracy would cherish. They go to the root of what a democracy is. It is unfortunate to see those kinds of actions. As members of Parliament, we would call on those in authority to cease and desist that kind of action. It is absolutely unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531641">The president and the government have a responsibility there. It is fine to say they will release some of the protesters, but this kind of action is intolerable. It cannot happen, and as the member has said, we have to condemn that type of action. We also have to ask the government and those in authority to intervene to make sure this form of expression is not thwarted. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531642">I know that from government to government there are various kinds of actions that can be taken to show how seriously this situation is viewed, but when we are in the midst of history taking place, in the midst of actions by both sides, it is important to be constructive, to try to move the moment forward, and to condemn those things that need to be condemned while yet keeping the lines of communication open. </ParaText>

It drives home further the point that having a debate on this subject is necessary, but translating our sentiments into concrete action is even more necessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531645">I wonder again whether Canada would be prepared to take a diplomatic initiative with other countries around the world. I am thinking of several in Europe and of the United States. These countries could develop a set of specific sanctions aimed not at Ukraine as a country and not at the Ukrainian people, but at Yanukovych and his government, his henchmen, and the oligarchs who support him. The sanctions would curtail their ability to use their assets, curtail their ability to travel and enjoy the fruits of their behaviour, and say very clearly on behalf of the world that what is happening in the Maidan tonight is not acceptable. The trampling on human rights and freedoms is not acceptable, and there will be consequences for doing so. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531646">Canada could not take that initiative on its own, but we could in concert with other countries. We could lead the effort to bring other countries together to focus attention on this issue and to make it clear to those who are perpetrating this violence that the world is watching this behaviour very closely and that the world deplores it.</ParaText>

He has not only spoken but has also travelled to Ukraine and has indicated what Canada's views are on this particular point.

              <ParaText id="3531651">Mr. Chair, one of the questions when it comes to concrete actions that we could take is how we can do things that do not hurt the people of Ukraine. There are various forms of sanctions. For example, in the days of apartheid, one particular sanction that the international community took was a sports sanction. In a sports-crazed country like South Africa, it really compelled people to demand change from their government. That is one of the things we could certainly investigate with our international partners.</ParaText>

Such actions could make a point succinctly while at the same time using all the channels available to exert pressure, not only from within this country but also through a consortium of countries, to make the point that it is important for forward progress to be made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531657">The financial circumstances of Ukraine and some of the counterbalancing issues draw them either to the Russian side or to the European Union. It is important that all nations look at that and be very constructive and instrumental in ensuring that there is value, not only for the people of Ukraine but for those in authority, to go in the direction that their people would like them to go.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531658">Mr. Chair, it is my honour to join my colleagues on both sides of the House in this take note debate. It is an important debate, as all of my colleagues in the House tonight have stated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531659">As we stand here speaking and declaring our support for the people of Ukraine, they are being violently arrested and thrown in jail for simply expressing their free opinion, an opinion they have fought long and hard for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531660">It is my privilege to represent a good number of Ukrainian Canadians not only in my constituency of Edmonton—Strathcona but right across Alberta. As all my colleagues know, many of the members of the provincial legislature, including former premiers, are of Ukrainian descent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531661">There is a long-standing, deep-seeded respect and admiration for the people of the Ukraine and those who have escaped very difficult circumstances to re-establish themselves in Canada. Therefore, there is this long-standing support for their friends and family who were left behind and a continued support for Ukraine to become an open and free democratic nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531662">Last year I had the privilege of taking two trips to Ukraine. The first was with the foreign affairs committee. With the national election coming forward, we went to Ukraine to look into complaints of erosion of the rule of law and democracy. We found very serious evidence of erosion in both circumstances. There was no longer freedom of the press. Those who were free journalists were now reduced to simply online reporting, if they were reporting. There was absolutely none of the traditional free media and press. If there was free press, the citizens were so poor that they could not afford it and could only rely on the government-controlled media.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531663">We met with representatives of human rights organizations and civil society, some of whom were simply fighting to get access to the records of the Holodomor, which were being locked away from them, fighting simply to recognize their history of a thousand years of struggle to be a free and independent nation and to ensure the youth of Ukraine understood the repression they had previously existed under so they would understand why it was so critical to fight for a free and democratic government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531664">As my colleagues have mentioned, I also had the great privilege of having youthful interns in my office. Each one of them have been astounded at the freedom we experience on this Hill. They could not believe that as elected representatives we did not have bodyguards. They could not believe that as simple student interns they could wander about freely and talk to elected representatives, staff and officials in the House of Commons. That is a real wake-up call to us because we take our freedoms for granted, until we run into people who do not experience that at home, irrespective of what their constitution extends to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531665">Tonight I want to give credit to my incredible legislative assistant. She has spent a lot of time in Ukraine in successive elections as a long-time monitor. I could not find a more stalwart defender of the rights of Ukrainians. I want to give her the courtesy of respect she deserves for speaking up daily for the people of Ukraine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531666">I know my Ukrainian Canadian constituents and those across Alberta are tuning in and watching this right now. They value the fact that we are taking the time, even though the House has shut down for the season, to stand in defence of their friends and relatives in Ukraine and the rights that we share here. I have been reminded that there is a time difference as we speak, but today representatives of both sides of the House attended the funeral for Nelson Mandela, who was the global champion for human rights and freedoms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531667"> Today is the 65th anniversary of the international human rights declaration. As we speak here today, the people of Ukraine are being attacked with bludgeons simply because they are standing up and defending their free right to trade and associate with people of other countries with which they would prefer to associate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531668">I want to share the words of the Ukrainian World Congress, which has reminded us of the words of Mr. Mandela, which are appropriate today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531669">Mr. Mandela stated, “For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others”. That is a good message to us. It is fine that we are free, but we have a responsibility to also speak for others who are still struggling out of those chains.</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531672"> I do not think the point could have been made any more strongly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531673">My staff member is very academic and learned and has read deeply on Ukraine. In fact, my most recent Ukrainian intern left me, as a gift, a thick tome on the history of Ukraine and I just did not have time tonight to completely go through it. However, I am reminded that this wonderful nation has struggled for over 1,000 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531674">The people of Ukraine have come out of repression after repression, first under Russia and then other nations, then under the Soviet Union. They certainly suffered under Stalin. I had the privilege of participating this year in two Holodomor memorials, one here on the Hill and one in Edmonton. It is a great privilege to be asked to participate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531675"> The Ukrainians are a people who are desperately seeking support to become a democratic nation and at every turn they think they are finally going to be free. In 1990, Ukraine's sovereignty was proclaimed. Then they signed onto their constitution, which guarantees them human rights and dignity, the same kind of human rights that we appreciate in Canada. Then 93% of Ukrainian citizens voted for an independent Ukraine and chose their first democratically elected president.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531676"> However, then in 2004 when there was evidence of electoral fraud, they took to the streets in their own Orange Revolution. In our party we have had our orange revolution. They had theirs and so we are brethren in loving the colour orange, as my colleague here wears proudly the scarf from the Ukrainian Orange Revolution. Still they suffer and they struggle. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531677">When I participated in the monitoring of the election last fall, I was stunned at the turnout. I asked to be in the city of Lviv, because it is such an extraordinarily beautiful old city on the western edge of Ukraine. We went to many places, including a prison and a mental hospital and they were lining up to vote. Then we went out to the suburbs and there were families coming with their baby carriages and they were bringing seniors in wheelchairs. They wanted to participate in a democratic nation. Then of course there were problems again, and we have run-up elections going on as we speak. One has to question how fair these elections will be, given what is happening on the streets of Ukraine. Still, I presume they will come out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531678">Now we have a president who has espoused that he wishes to enter into friendship with Canada and with our friends and colleagues in the European community and at the last minute pulls out of those negotiations under pressure, we understand, from Russia. Deservedly and understandably, the people of Ukraine, who wish to align with the European community and consider themselves Europeans, have taken to the streets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531679"> What is the response by the government of Ukraine? It responds with bludgeons, arresting people, beating up people, throwing them in jail. We know from our experience in Ukraine. We met with the lawyers and family for at least three of the opposition members who are still jailed. They simply do not have fair representation. They are just simply held and detained. There still is no democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531680"> It is important for us to recognize that we continue to try to work with Ukraine, that we continue to try to provide aid building civil society, but we need to recognize that moments like this occur and that we are simply not giving enough support. There is cause. Our House is closing for the season and it is incumbent upon the government because it continues to be the voice for Canadians. We will stand with the government and hope that it will take stronger action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531681">In closing, I want to share some of the words from the youth of Edmonton. The Ukrainian youth have been taking to the streets as well and Ukrainian students are studying in Edmonton.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531682"> They tell the House that 300,000 of the Ukrainian community in Alberta are united with the millions of Ukrainians in the diaspora. They want to ensure the safety of their peaceful demonstrations in Kiev and they are vigilantly preserved until they themselves choose to disperse. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531683">They urge the Government of Canada, all western governments and western media to understand what they are seeing and hearing and to understand much of the street fighting is purposefully instigated by provocateurs.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="25">(2025)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3531684"> Clearly they are in touch with their friends and family in Kiev and this is what they are reporting. They are calling for peaceful, safe resolve of the issues. They are calling on Canada to speak to the United States and have the President of the United States also speak out. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531685">Perhaps in questions I can also share the words of some of the other Edmontonians who wish to share with the House their feelings on what is going on.</ParaText>

These are problems that have accumulated to where we have these protests taking place. They have accumulated to a situation where the government has decided to use military and police force to clear the streets, to clear Independence Square, to clear everyone out there trying to make their point that the current situation is not acceptable to them and it is not acceptable to us around the world. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531688">What we have experienced so far is an unwillingness to listen to the people, a complete disrespect for democratic processes within Ukraine.

              <ParaText id="3531690">I would like to share some of the appeals of civil society representatives of Ukraine. They issued a release December 10. The civil society represents economists, lawyers, educators, business experts, a wide array of representatives from the people of Ukraine. They are calling on us to condemn the use of excessive force by the special forces of the ministry of internal affairs. They are calling on the government of Ukraine to not simply turn to politicians to resolve this impasse, but to directly engage the active participation of civil society, which is what we have heard. That is where we can help. We can help by standing by civil society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531691">If the government does not have this release, I would be happy to share it. The representatives list a good numbers of actions that they are calling on us to support them in the action with Ukraine. They want the government to sign the association agreement with the European Union. They want to develop the basic principles under the constitution, which enable the consensus and engagement of civil society. They want the adoption of electoral code. That sounds familiar. They want the re-election of the chairman of the supreme court, high specialized court and on it goes. They have some very specific actions that they want in order to actually make an effective democracy. </ParaText>

The media in Canada is watching this story closely. At the same time, many of my friends in Ukraine have also been contacting me, ensuring that I see the live feeds coming in from Independence Square in Kiev on what is happening in the Maidan and wanting to ensure that Canada is fully aware of the strong hand of government, of the police brutality that is taking place at this moment in Ukraine.</ParaText>

It joined the World Trade Organization. One of the first things it did, although it was legal, was to apply tariffs to over 370 commodities, products and services across this country. We are trying to negotiate a free trade agreement with Ukraine, and that is not negotiating in good faith, in my opinion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531720">We know that did not sit well and stuck in the craw of the European Union, which was in the process of closing a deal with Ukraine that was to be signed off on at the end of November in Vilnius, Lithuania, so that there would be a true economic co-operative agreement, free trade and more integration within the European Union for the Ukrainian people. President Yanukovych walking away from that deal has created this huge public outcry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531721">What we have witnessed over the last 10 years, from election interference and no respect for the rule of law to continued Soviet-style governance systems, has now accumulated with what we see happening with the Euromaidan. We have to continue to engage Ukraine. We cannot allow this to continue to happen. At the same time, we have to see some good faith from Ukraine and we have not seen any good faith in a long time. The closest thing we have seen was when it released Yuriy Lutsenko, who was one of the political leaders and lawyer for Yulia Tymoshenko. That is the only step of good faith that we have seen from this administration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531722">When I did my last election monitoring in Ukraine for the parliamentary elections last year, I was part of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the OSCE, parliamentary delegation. There were a number of us who were part of that parliamentary delegation. We were on the ground doing election monitoring. I definitely saw improvements in the way the elections were being carried out, but starting this weekend there are a number of by-elections in Ukraine because so many results were thrown out for interference, fraud and other corruption charges on a number of different oblasts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531723">They are redoing those elections and there will again be another Canadian delegation going there, run by CANADEM. They will again be monitoring the situation, but it is going to be under a much more difficult scenario because of the peaceful protests that are taking place. Unfortunately, those protesters are being shoved aside, their tent city ripped down, and Maidan being destroyed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531724">Just last week, the OSCE had a meeting. Its 20th ministerial council was held in Kiev and our <Affiliation DbId="170677" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation>, who has had such a strong, principled stand on how we engage with Ukraine, was there. I was very proud when I saw him and Paul Grod, who is the president of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress, walking through Independence Square with the Canadian maple leaf strapped on their backs, showing the people of Ukraine that Canada stands in solidarity with them, that we will stay engaged and we will make sure that their aspirations will be realized.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531745">Mr. Chair, there could be two schools of thought on that. There are definitely those who want to see us bring forward sanctions, want to see us be tougher in our dealings, to walk away from any co-operation that we have with Ukraine. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531746">We have the youth mobility agreement. We have had discussions already, which we have suspended, on Canada-Ukrainian free trade. We have military co-operation in training officers and doing officer exchanges between Ukraine and Canada. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531748">I am not opposed to some of those ideas. I think from the government's standpoint, especially what I am hearing from the Ukrainian-Canadian Congress and from my constituents who are interested in this, whether they have Ukrainian heritage or not, people want to see us more engaged. They want to see us pulling the people of the Ukraine and the governments they have into more of a western model. If we abandon them now or push them away, and it is seen as pushing them away, it may embolden some of their neighbours. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531749">Right now, one of the reasons we are where we are today is because of some of the bullying tactics that have been implemented by some of their neighbours to the north. Because of that interference and the fearmongering that has taken place to essentially push President Yanukovych into walking away from the table with the European Union, we need to be out there with the Europeans, the Americans, and with other allies who want to see a stronger, more westernized and more democratic Ukraine. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531753">Mr. Chair, we never know exactly what is in the mind of President Yanukovych these days. There is a lot of speculation out there.

I have a great concern that the current administration would rather be more tied in to the past than look to the future. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531755">I ask that he strongly consider the will of the people, and I ask my friends from the Ukrainian Embassy to carry that message back. I ask them to consider the will of the people and the wishes they are laying out.

              <ParaText id="3531762"> A number of years ago I received an invitation, as we all do, to come to city hall to make a few remarks about the Holodomor. I confess that at the time, I did not know about it. This was the better part of 10 years ago. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531763">I researched it, as we all do, and I was shocked that I did not know about it. I was shocked that it seemed that most of the world did not know. It has only been in the ensuing years that now it has become, certainly here in Canada, a recognized date and time for us to reflect on those who were murdered by Stalin and the Communist Soviet empire.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531764">A while went by, and just before Christmas in 2004, the word was going around that they were looking for MPs who wanted to go to Ukraine for an election observation mission. The only thing I knew about that was that Jimmy Carter did it. He did Habitat for Humanities, and he did these election observation missions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531765">When one is in the fourth party in the back row, one really is looking for some means to have some real effect beyond just the seat one has. I thought this was a great opportunity to do that, so I went to Ukraine. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531766">I have been there three times, but the first time I went was in 2004 during the Orange Revolution. I see my friends, some of whom were on those missions with me, nodding their heads. I have to say that for an NDPer to be in Ukraine in 2004 was political heaven. I mean, everything was in orange, evening the Mercedes-Benzes and the banks. Everything was decked out in orange, at least in Kiev, so I certainly felt at home with the colour and the sentiment behind it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531767">What I remember more than anything about that was getting up in the middle of the night because I was drawn to Independence Square and the tent city that had formed. They had their own security system and their own supply system. They were totally self-contained within the confines of the downtown in Independence Square in Kiev. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531768">What struck me was that the young people were the drumbeat that kept it going. Day in and day out, they would ensure that they did everything that needed to be done to maintain their presence. Now we hear that forces are moving into Independence Square to try to prevent something like that from happening, it would seem, through violence. That breaks our hearts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531769">The other thing I want to mention about that particular election is not only what it was like to be in a revolution in modern times, but the impact it had on individual citizens.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531770">I remember specifically one voting station in a village in the mountains. One young man, who was probably in his early thirties, was carrying his young son. They went into the voting area and came out with a ballot. He got right up to the box, and he handed it to his son, who was maybe age seven or eight, and said something to him. Of course, I could not understand Ukrainian. His young son dropped the ballot in and I asked my interpreter what he had said. What he had whispered to his son was, “this is how we keep our future”. A whole nation was going through that simultaneously in 2004.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531771">I returned again in 2010, six years later, for the presidential elections, and then returned two weeks later for the runoff. Although I am by no means an expert on that part of the world or the dynamics, it was pretty clear from the results that something like today was going to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531772"> Those of us who have been following some of the issues there know that language issues, the struggle between Russian and Ukrainian and which has priority and is recognized, is a huge issue for them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531773">In the election, the country divided right down the middle, not just demographically or even politically but actually geographically. The western part of the country wanted to go more to Europe and to the west and the east wanted to stay closer to Russia. In fact, as one goes closer to the Russian border, as would be expected, there is more and more Russian language.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531774"> I am not surprised that this day came. It is still heartbreaking that it is here, but I cannot say that I am surprised. As we stand here, I do not think there is a simple answer to this except that the only way the Ukrainian people can work this through in a way that is acceptable is that there has to be peace. There has to be peace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531775">I think about the people when their election was fraudulent, back in 2004. What struck me more than anything when the word came out that the election result was not what they expected was that people started coming out of their offices, out of their homes, and out of the schools, and they just started gravitating to Independence Square. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531776">What struck me, to this day, is the fact that none of them knew for certain that there were not going to be tanks coming around the corner. They did not know for sure that they would not be facing a hail of bullets. Yet the desire, the demand, for fairness in their elections and a real democracy was so great that in spite of that possible threat to their own lives, they stayed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531777">They came out by the hundreds, then the thousands, then the tens of thousands, and when it got to be hundreds of thousands, finally the supreme court, I believe, and it is just my opinion, caved in the face of that kind of public pressure. It said that the election was null and void and called for the runoff. That is when we came from Canada, as many as we could stuff on planes, and headed over there to observe that runoff to try to assist the Ukrainian people in having a free and fair election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531778">What I know from that experience is that those who are there now, as we speak, in Independence Square, are not going anywhere. What they need more than anything is to know that the world is with them. They need that critical mass of free voices around the world, as we are doing here today, to speak out for them and say that this is not acceptable and that Ukrainians, like Canadians, are entitled to and deserve free and fair elections. They deserve a transparent democracy. They deserve control of their own country. </ParaText>

I just want to say that I feel very good about this place, leaving here knowing that the last thing we were talking about on behalf of the people we represent was someone else. We are putting our voices and support toward their cause. Today, at this moment, we in the House stand united. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531780">I would hope that every free country in the world is standing united and solidly in speaking out, as we are doing here tonight. One of the best things we can do for the struggle happening right now in Ukraine is to let them know that they are not alone. They have the bravery. They have the vision. They just need the support of everyone else to force the powers that be to leave them in peace and let them have the freedom they are entitled to. </ParaText>

There are buildings surrounding it. It is a large square, but it is confined once there are a lot people in it. When we start seeing the police standing shoulder to shoulder with shields, no doubt there is a lot of fear there. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531786"> We have a very strong Canada-Ukrainian friendship group and a great tie with Paul Grod, whose name has been mentioned here, who has been in touch and may even be watching as we speak. The Ukrainian Canadian Congress has put out a nine-step program it has asked us to consider. Certainly we in the official opposition are very comfortable with it and think that all nine would be positive steps forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531787">In addition to our voices, we are sending over another planeload of observers for some by-elections to continue our ties and to ensure that the leadership of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress knows that it has the support of this Parliament. Mostly I think the best thing we can do is to continue to raise our voices and lend our voices to this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531788">As much as I spend most of my time going after the government, on this file I think the government has been responsive to the needs. I would hope that it would look carefully at the nine-step program that has been suggested by the congress. I am sure it will. A positive step in the right direction would be to say to our own congress here in Canada that the nine steps it has suggested to the Canadian Parliament are ones we support, endorse, and will be moving on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531789">They are sweeping. Some are short-term and some are longer-term. My point is that short, medium or long term, we lend our voices. We lend whatever credibility we can from this place. In the longer term, let us roll up our sleeves and start acting on these nine recommendations that, if implemented, will make a difference. That is why we are here tonight: short-term commitment; medium-term goals; long-term vision. I think that reflects where we all are tonight.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531791">Even in the riding of Algoma—Manitoulin—Kapuskasing, there are many people of Ukrainian descent. Actually, I worked with a colleague in probation and parole services whose family was from Ukraine.</ParaText>

My colleague mentioned some longer-term plan the government should be looking at. We need to impress upon the government the need to make sure that there is a plan B. It is important for us to raise our voices. We need more people to raise their voices, but we also need a government whose members are going to be steadfast should it have to go a bit further.</ParaText>

We were there through our regular Christmas season, and we left a day or two before the Orthodox Christmas. I know how religious Ukrainian people are and how much their faith means to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531795">As my friend was speaking, it occurred to me to wonder just how far those soldiers and police officers will go as they enter this season of Christmas and reflect on humanity, love, hope, and optimism. When those bullets start flying, those who are holding the weapons do not know where the bullets are necessarily going to end up. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531796">I have also done observation missions in a number of other emerging democracies in the Soviet bloc, including Georgia, Moldova, and Serbia. I know that there is a certain critical mass when those who have been ordered to commit the violence suddenly see their family members, their neighbours, and their co-workers in the crowd. That is the moment when we see the flower going in the barrel of a gun, and they just stop and say wait, this is not going to happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531797">There is already violence. I can only hope that before it gets to that level of violence, the season and the Mandela spirit will take hold, maybe not among those making the decisions but perhaps among those who are holding the weapons and who hold the key to peace or force. Maybe they themselves will say, “This is wrong. It is wrong for my people and it is wrong for my country”. Let us hope.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531806">I will speak briefly about Canada's developmental systems in Ukraine and specifically about our continuing commitment to advancing democracy and the rule of law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531807">Our respective nations share historic ties that extend back through generations of Ukrainian migration to Canada. Ukrainian Canadians have given so much to Canada, and Canada remains committed to giving back to the Ukraine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531808">In 1991, Canada was the first western nation to recognize Ukraine's independence. Since then, we have devoted considerable effort and resources to support the Ukraine's democratic and economic transition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531809">Good governance is vital to democracy and for achieving the sustainable economic growth required to move populations from poverty to prosperity. It provides the processes and institutions through which a government is accountable to its citizens. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531810">An election is democracy's fundamental accountability process. It is essential that election processes be fair and free to ensure leaders are genuinely accountable to the people they are elected to represent. As we know, this lack of accountability has been an area of deep concern in Ukraine for quite some time. That is why Canada has provided consistent support for free and fair elections in Ukraine over the last two decades by sending election observers to witness the 2004 and 2010 presidential elections and the 2006 and 2007 parliamentary votes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531811">In 2012, Canada fielded its largest-ever electoral observation mission, sending 500 Canadians as observers with the Mission Canada bilateral electoral observation mission. Overall, Canada provided $11.4 million in support for the 2012 election process, particularly through Mission Canada but also through support to Ukrainian civil society organizations that mobilized thousands of young volunteers to conduct their own election monitoring and public awareness campaigns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531812">Through its development program, Canada has also provided technical assistance to Ukraine to modernize its electoral laws and systems. Through the implementation of an online training system for electoral commission members and observers, this system is now being used for the repeat elections that are now under way. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531813">Canada is known for its ardent support for elections in Ukraine. The observers Canada has sent to Ukraine over the years have seen the reality of Ukraine's electoral processes. They know there is a long way to go for Ukraine to reach the international standards of free and fair elections.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531814">In 2012, observers witnessed the misuse of state resources, a lack of transparency of campaign and party financing, vote buying, and biased media coverage, but they also observed a real democratic competition, fierce at times, and an unprecedented engagement of Ukrainian youth in domestic electoral observation efforts. This is cause for hope. Without Canadian and other international observers, the situation might have been much worse. Ukrainian citizens are very appreciative of Canada's generous election observation efforts and solidarity. The Ukrainian people yearn to live in a real democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531815">A functioning democracy needs active, informed citizens, well-functioning public institutions, and rule of law. Canadian development assistance to Ukraine reflects this. Despite Canada's ongoing contributions and despite contributions from many other countries wanting and working for a more free and democratic Ukraine, recent events demonstrate that a democratic deficit still exists and indeed appears to be deepening. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531816">Canada has continued to support Ukrainian efforts toward the rule of law. Canadian development assistance work in the judicial sector has helped ensure timely and transparent court decisions in selected courts. This project is introducing a comprehensive curriculum and training program to improve the capacity of judges to streamline the resolution of commercial cases involving small and medium-sized enterprises.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531817">Canada will continue its support for democracy and the rule of law in Ukraine. It continues to be our priority to work in the best interests of Ukraine's citizens so that they can have complete faith in their electoral processes and ultimately reap the rewards of a truly democratic and prosperous society.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531822">We met with a group of people from the media. One thing that we heard from the media was that it was very difficult for the free media to get the voice of the people of Ukraine out to the people because they did not have advertisers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531823">I was very pleased to support one of the radio stations. It was a free radio station in Ukraine.

              <ParaText id="3531831">Mr. Chair, this is a very emotional debate for me personally. I am of eastern European descent. My father was born in Czechoslovakia, my mother was born in Poland, and I remember the Prague Spring of 1968. I remember being a young Czech lad in Winnipeg. My father being the treasurer of the Czecho-Slovak Benevolent Association, we hosted Czech refugees in Winnipeg when the Russians invaded Czechoslovakia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531832">Of course, since I was a teenager at the time, the import of this and how important it was really did not sink in. It is only now, as one of the two people of Czech extraction ever to be in the Canadian Parliament, I realize what a significant event that was.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531833">From that point on, tyranny was something that I abhorred and freedom was something that I revered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531834">When I look at what has happened to Czechoslovakia, now the Czech Republic and Slovakia after the Velvet Divorce, and I look at Poland, and I remember that half of the Berlin Wall fell, I see that two and then three countries managed that transition very well. Those three countries are now functioning democracies. They have their issues and their problems, but they are run by the rule of law and democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531835">I visited the Czech Republic a couple of years ago. I was struck by the progress that country has made. It has joined the European family, joined the democratic world, joined with participating in free trade and free markets. The Czech Republic's technology is remarkable, and Slovakia is now the European leader in automobile production per capita, which is something that I did not know.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531836">Therefore, when I look at the success of those three countries, I ask myself what happened to Ukraine. Why has Ukraine devolved into what it is now?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531837">It is not that the people are not innovative. It is not that the people are not productive. It is not that the land is not productive. It is not that there are no energy resources. Ukraine has everything to make itself a successful and functioning democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531838">I should make the point of how proud I am as a member of this particular Conservative caucus to have people like the member for <Affiliation DbId="170501" Type="2">Mississauga East—Cooksville</Affiliation>, who fought with Solidarity in Poland, and the member for <Affiliation DbId="170886" Type="2">Etobicoke Centre</Affiliation>, who fought in Bosnia against tyranny. That is a track record this side of the House has that few others have. I am very proud to be part of a caucus with those two individuals and others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531839">I must say that I listened to the other side. As a person of east European background, I hear their fine words. They all sound good. However, people on that particular side of the political spectrum were the enablers of Communism for all those many years. They had writers like Walter Duranty lauding Stalin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531840"> I may believe that the other side now has had a change of heart, but deep down inside I am suspicious. They have a lot to atone for and they have not atoned for it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531841">I think they are just riding on the coattails of this issue. I am happy to have their support, and it all sounds good, but they need to look at their heart of hearts and search where they and their parties came from. They need to think about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531842">The promise of Ukraine is, as I said, remarkable. It has the land, it has the energy, it has the resources, but because of where it is located and because of its proximity to Russia, it is, as the saying goes, caught between a rock and a hard place. The tragedy, quite frankly, is epic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531843">My constituency has the largest population of Ukrainians in Canada. They make up roughly 35% of my constituency. When I look at what the Ukrainians in my constituency have done, it is truly remarkable. They are successful farmers, successful small business people. We have lovingly maintained churches that maintain the Ukrainian culture. In the Ukrainian museums in my constituency, the poems of Taras Shevchenko still resonate among the people there. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3531859">Mr. Chair, I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this debate. Like so many of my colleagues, I have been following the situation in Ukraine closely. I meet frequently with members of the Ukrainian Canadian community in Etobicoke—Lakeshore and I know how serious the current situation is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531860">The concerns are larger than a free trade agreement. We are concerned about the use of selective sentencing in the case of Yulia Tymoshenko and others. We are also concerned about the weakness of democratic institutions, the resulting damage to the Ukrainian economy and, of course, the lack of opportunity and hope for Ukrainians, especially youth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531861"> Our government is deeply disappointed with the Ukrainian government's decision to suspend its association agreement and the deep and comprehensive free trade area negotiations with the European Union. We believe this decision is a lost opportunity and we stand with all Ukrainians who are fighting for a democratic, free, independent and prosperous Ukraine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531862">Ukraine's best hope for democracy and economic prosperity lies in closer alignment with Euro-Atlantic norms and institutions. Unlike Poland, Slovakia and other eastern European states that have made great progress since the fall of communism, Ukraine's economic transition has been much slower and more difficult. Today, people of Ukrainian heritage make up almost 4% of the total Canadian population. Over the generations, we have developed a close bilateral relationship, a solid economic partnership and strong people to people ties. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531863">I would like to take a few moments today to talk about Canada's work to help Ukraine achieve economic prosperity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531864"> Canada is focusing on three broad areas of intervention to aid in Ukraine's economic growth through our development assistance plan that is focused on building democracy through strong economic foundations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531865">The first is to strengthen the investment climate in a sustainable way by building economic foundations. This means improving the capacity at all levels of government to deliver on the basic needs of citizens and to create a supportive framework for business growth, trade and investment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531866">The second focus area is building businesses, especially those that are micro, small and medium-sized firms, to make them sustainable and competitive. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531867">I want to mention, Mr. Chair, that I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="170501" Type="2">Mississauga East—Cooksville</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531868">As I was saying, this means helping entrepreneurs access business networks and financing, value chains and productivity-enhancing technology.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531869">The third focus area is investing in people, particularly women and youth, to build a skilled workforce that can thrive in a rapidly expanding labour market. Investments of development assistance in these three areas will lead to increased employment opportunities and enhanced business productivity in Ukraine, resulting in rising household incomes and reduced poverty over the long term. Canada's development program has contributed significantly to advancing Ukraine's sustainable economic growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531870">One of the key sectors in Ukraine is agriculture. What is required for agriculture is agricultural insurance so farmers can invest with confidence and allow banks to loan to farmers with confidence. With support from Canada, Ukraine has implemented a new agricultural insurance system based on international best practices. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531871">Canadian support has also helped increase the competitiveness of smallholder horticulture and dairy farmers who have invested in improved technology and are working together to market higher-value, higher-quality products demanded by the marketplace. With help from Canada, participating smallholder horticulture farmers in southern Ukraine have sold over 12,000 tonnes of produce for over $12 million and they have increased their household incomes over 30% since the start of the project.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531872">The Federation of Canadian Municipalities has worked with municipal partners in Ukraine to develop and implement regional economic development plans that have helped attract projects that total more than $5.4 million of outside investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531873">We are working to improve the planning and delivery of services and we are assisting with the development of a national demand-driven vocational skills training system across the country. Each of these initiatives will help to increase broad-based economic growth in Ukraine critical to creating a healthy and politically engaged middle class. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531874">We are doing all of these things and so much more because we believe in Ukraine and its people and we will continue with this important work. We remain hopeful that preparations for the Ukraine-EU agreement will resume in the near future and Canada has been lending its voice to encourage Ukraine to continue those discussions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531875">As we know from experience, one trade arrangement with one bloc does not preclude concluding other trade arrangements with others. The fact that we have recently concluded an agreement in principle with the European Union does not prevent us from having a very profitable arrangement with North America, for example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531876"> We assume that the Ukrainian people will continue their struggle and we will be there to support them. Hopefully, they will move forward to a more prosperous future.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531881">Mr. Chair, I appreciate the comments from the member. I cannot help but think in terms of one of the reasons why we have this situation in Ukraine today is because of maybe a fear factor between let us say Russia and Ukraine and the European Union, where there are those who stay closer to the European Union and a smaller portion who want to enhance Russia in a protective mode which is to their detriment. That is just a personal opinion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531882">The member made reference to the fact that in Canada we had free trade agreements with many countries. This is something in which the population as a whole in Ukraine recognizes the value, that it can continue on trade with Russia and have an agreement with the European Union. Further to that, ultimately it could have a free trade agreement with Canada. It is all a good thing if the political will were to move in that direction. The concern is the political will.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531883">I am wondering if the member might want to provide comments in regard to the political will of the Ukrainian president and if the member has some thoughts on this.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3531884">Mr. Chair, I appreciate my colleague's comments. I think the core of the problem is really a lack of political will. On its merits, as my colleague can appreciate, additional free trade agreements are good for everyone involved. Freer trade results in freer opportunities, more opportunities and more prosperity for everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531885">As a distant observer, we shake our heads and ask why Ukraine would walk away from a tighter economic integration with Europe. There was a lack of political will. The Ukrainian administration did not want to get closer to Europe largely because it was pressured by Russia, let us be honest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531886">I also think there is a lack of political will on Europe's part. We all know that Europe has its own economic challenges. Looking at the prospect of having to extend billions of dollars to Ukraine so it can avoid default was a real challenge. Europe has had enough challenges in its own back yard with Greece, Portugal, Italy, Spain and other countries and it has really hesitated to say that it should put money forward at this time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531887">If there had been more political will, there should have been a way to make this happen.

              <ParaText id="3531888">Mr. Chair, I am very honoured and proud to take part in this debate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531889">I would like to start by citing some historical aspects that have a lot of connection to this debate. The hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170251" Type="2">Hamilton Centre</Affiliation> mentioned that we are remembering Nelson Mandela, a great person who brought freedom to South Africa. As well, my colleague for <Affiliation DbId="170623" Type="2">Dauphin—Swan River—Marquette</Affiliation> mentioned the invasion on Czechoslovakia, which I remember very well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531890">I grew up in Poland under a communist system. I was too young to remember the invasion of Hungary in 1956, as I was only two years old, but I remember very well the invasion of Czechoslovakia. I grew up only eight kilometres from the border. I remember the moving troops and planes flying for days in the sky to the south. I perhaps did not have a full understanding of what was going on, but this debate has had a great significance for me personally because the 32nd anniversary of the imposition of martial law in Poland happened on December 13, 1981. The communist government decided to break the solidarity movement that started on August 1980, the first free trade union in a Soviet-controlled communist country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531891">It is a kind of oxymoron that countries run by the working people would have a union to allow for human rights for working people, but that was the case. After a year and a half of relatively free movement, General Jaruzelski and the government decided to end this. Troops and riot police were brought in. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531892">I was on strike with my fellow workers facing the tanks and riot police, which at that time in Poland were called ZOMO. Now, in Kiev they are called Berkut. They are trying to restore order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531893">The reason I speak of all of this is because we are having this debate with support from both sides of the House, and it is great that this is happening in our Canadian Parliament. However, on December 13, 1981, when I and my fellow workers and friends were listening to the radio, it was discouraging that the sitting prime minister of Canada sided with the oppressive regime of Poland.</ParaText>

                <B>Mr. Wladyslaw Lizon:</B> I guess it was Pierre Trudeau at that time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531896">That is why it is so encouraging that today we are joining together in support of those in the Ukraine who are asking for the right to decide on their own where their country should go. The decisions of where Ukraine should go should not be made in the Kremlin or anywhere else; they should be made by the Ukrainian people. They have the capacity to make their own decisions on where they want to go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531897">I would like to express my concern. This is compounded by the current economic situation that will not be improved by President Yanukovych shunning the European Union and the west, nor by his disregard for the collective will of the country's citizens.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="50">(2150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3531898">The government and the people of Canada are determined to assist the development of the Ukraine's economy to help Ukraine to improve its standard of living and to benefit from the freedom of a rules-based economic system, absent of the constraints of corruption and inadequate governance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531899">The current economic climate is Ukraine is very troubled. In a most recent report, the World Bank has forecast 0% growth for Ukraine in 2013, citing a weak global environment and delays in domestic policy adjustments. The bank cited high fiscal debt levels and a need to proceed with structural adjustments. Indeed, the IMF has characterized Ukraine as off track. As well, Ukraine faces worsening liquidity conditions and a banking sector that shows structural weaknesses, while access to long-term funding for businesses is difficult.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531900">The Ukrainian government's privatization program has also generated concern, as many believe it will only benefit Ukraine's oligarchs. An association agreement and a deep and comprehensive free trade area with the EU could have put Ukraine on the path to economic stability and prosperity. Instead, the Yanukovych government rejected the opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531901">In the recent news I read, it is very troubling. Berkut cleared out the Maidan, the Independence Square in Kiev, and we do not know what will happen with the tent city that was set up there, but we should all be in support of the people in Maidan in Kiev in Ukraine.</ParaText>

Not to compare today's Ukraine, as worrisome as the situation is, to the period of Soviet darkness, but the member pointed out how when Prime Minister Trudeau pointedly refused, the only western leader to refuse, to condemn the imposition of martial law in Poland, that was used by the communist regime as a tool of propaganda.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531908">On the other hand, when President Reagan spoke about the evil empire behind the Iron Curtain, the western left may have mocked him, but refuseniks like Natan Sharansky realized that they had friends who were not going to give up on the fight for freedom.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531909">Would the member like to comment on that and also express what I believe is the unanimous sense of this place that we condemn the use of force occurring right now, as we speak, in Kiev against the Euromaidan peaceful protesters, and that Canada will work with its allies to ensure that in the future, people who violate the fundamental rights of free protesters will be held to account.</ParaText>

I know from my own experience that when we heard on the radio, as we had no TVs, that there were people supporting us in New York, Washington, Chicago and in Toronto. This is the encouragement and driving force for the people on the ground. They will use that force to make the change and that is why we are so important and that is why this debate is so important.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3531911">Mr. Chair, I will not hide the fact that it is with emotion that I am speaking tonight on the situation in Ukraine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531912">That emotion is tied, in part, to the speech and testimony of the previous speaker, who experienced the repression in Poland under the Soviet regime first-hand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531913">I am also emotional because of the interest I have had in Russian culture for many years now. I have read certain authors who were severely repressed in the Soviet Union. Those readings have helped me discover a rich world with very deep historic roots.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531914">Whether we like it or not, Ukraine's future is closely tied to that of Russia. For the Ukrainian people, living under the rule of Russia and the Soviet Union—in recent history and in the past—was a denial of their culture, their identity and their dreams of controlling their own destiny.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531915">This probably explains the reaction and the strong grassroots movement we have been seeing for the past few weeks. This grassroots movement is an echo of the fabled Orange Revolution, which took place nearly 10 years ago, when people refused to accept a set of circumstances linked not only to their leader at the time, but also to Russian control.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531916">The issues related to this crisis and this grassroots movement are not just democratic and economic; they are also cultural and relate to the Ukrainian sense of identity. I would even say that they are spiritual; they have to do with the Ukrainian soul. This explains why the protesters reacted so strongly to President Viktor Yanukovych's scarcely justifiable decision regarding the legitimate aspirations of the Ukrainian people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531917">This decision basically constitutes a complete and sudden flip-flop on the part of President Viktor Yanukovych with regard to negotiations and the path his government had been on for some time, which involved creating and maintaining ties with Europe. Those ties were linked primarily to economic exchanges, but could have gone further. They could have allowed Ukrainians to improve their lot, first and foremost, but also to fully express their identity and their culture with real pride.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531918">It therefore comes as no surprise that the people reacted so strongly. Of course, people felt threatened by the old Russian controls, which unfortunately still exist today as a result of current economic ties, the Ukraine's dependence on Russian oil, among other things, and strong economic exchanges.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="05">(2205)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3531919">These factors could well prevent the Ukraine from pursuing its efforts to take full charge of its destiny.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531920">For people who have lived for so long, for centuries, under authoritarian regimes, especially under foreign regimes outside the Ukrainian nation, the path to democracy is obviously challenging, tortuous and very difficult. The current government was democratically elected, but now it is working to turn back the tide of progress, to reverse an entire process, a steady progression towards advances and achievements. It is obvious that President Yanukovych is either refusing to understand or is responding to interests other than the public good, the good of his fellow citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531921">Given these facts, how could we not denounce the government's violence against the protesters? How could we not denounce this denial of the people's will and aspirations? The people cannot act solely through an electoral process, but must also use other options such as the public forum to protest, engage or interact with the officials in power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531922">We must truly stand by the Ukrainian people. In fact, more than stand by, we must give them our unwavering support. They must be given the opportunity to grow in a process that is brand new, unlike ours. Indeed , we already have a democratic tradition. It is not that old, going back barely 150 years. However, our democratic tradition is the heir to ancient British traditions, a history that spans nearly a thousand years. One might even say it is our western heritage in general. Indeed, our close ties with the United States are also part of our evolution. Our institutions also developed alongside our American neighbours.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531923">Likewise, Ukrainians must somehow respond to their environment, but this response cannot occur in isolation. It must have support, not only from European countries, but from Canada as well, especially since Canada has a reputation, indeed a certain status, that gives it an almost de facto power to mediate certain situations in the world. I have heard this throughout my two and a half years as an MP. In my riding, I keep in touch with various communities, especially in Central Africa. They have praised Canada's voice in the world and clearly told me that it was a voice of authority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531924">We must really use that voice. In that sense, I join my colleagues from the other parties who spoke about offering strong support to uphold this democratic process and to avoid abuses of power. Canada has to be a major player in Ukraine to help this fledgling democratic process triumph, mature and grow over the coming years. This will not be settled in a matter of days. Everyone agrees on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3531925">Let us make a commitment to the Ukrainian people and help them realize these legitimate aspirations. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3531927">Having said that, I want to conclude my remarks by reflecting on what Canadians as a whole have shared with members of all political parties on all sides of the House, that is that we are genuinely concerned about what is happening in Ukraine today. Whether one is a current leader of a political party, a critic or any member of Parliament inside this chamber, I do believe that what we ultimately want is what the population of Ukraine wants. What we are asking for is that there is a respect for rule of law, democracy, and that we ensure human rights are being protected. That is ultimately what it is that we would like to see. Would the member care to provide comment on that?</ParaText>
