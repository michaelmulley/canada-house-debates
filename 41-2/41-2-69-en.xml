Second reading</ProceduralText><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Lamoureux" id="8301484"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170750" Type="2">Mr. Kevin Lamoureux (Winnipeg North, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3642966">Mr. Speaker, I would like to indicate that I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="170396" Type="2">Charlottetown</Affiliation>. </ParaText><ParaText id="3642967">I must say, it is a bit of a challenge to address such a large bill in only 10 minutes, but I will give it my best shot.</ParaText><ParaText id="3642968">Within the Liberal Party, we have talked a great deal about the middle class over the last period of time. We believe that the government is not doing what needs to be done to assist the middle class of Canada. I would suggest that some of the questions we have raised, and the general of lack of a response from the government, speaks volumes about the way the government treats the middle class of Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3642969"> I thought it was most interesting yesterday when my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="199815" Type="2">Toronto Centre</Affiliation> made reference to median household income. The government really needs to understand how the middle class has been neglected. When we look at median household income, 50% of Canada's population has received an increase of $100 since the government took office. In fact, if we look at the bottom 20%, we are talking about a decrease of $500.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3642970">We need to put in proper perspective how difficult it is for our middle class today and why the government needs to give more attention to this issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="3642971">Look at personal debt today. Never before has it been as high, and the government seems to pay no attention. The government has failed to address what are important and critical issues for our middle class.</ParaText><ParaText id="3642972"> Health care is an issue all Canadians are concerned about. There is no issue more important in terms of a social service provided by the government than the issue of health care, with the possible exception of some of our pension programs and veterans' services. </ParaText><ParaText id="3642973">What have we seen? The government has dropped the ball in a significant way. It is a government that does not recognize the important leadership role it is supposed to be playing in what is one of the most important issues for Canadians, that being health care.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3642974">Why has the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> not met with his premier counterparts? Why have we not seen an attempt by the government to build on the 2004 health care accord? It was put in place under Paul Martin. Canadians and politicians from coast to coast saw the merits and benefits of that accord. </ParaText><ParaText id="3642975">What has the government done? It has let the clock run down. As of midnight, March 31, that ten-year health care accord has expired, and the government let it go without a whisper. There was no action. There was no indication that it really cared about the future of health care in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3642976">The Conservatives will say that they have increased health care spending to record highs. I will agree that health care spending from Ottawa going to our provinces is at record highs. I will agree on that point. However, it is not the Conservative Party that established the amount of money going to health care today. It was under Paul Martin that the Liberal Party of Canada signed off on the health care accord. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3642977">It was the actions of the Liberal Party that allowed the government to claim that we have record amounts of health care dollars going to our provinces.</ParaText><ParaText id="3642978">A member across the floor is heckling with regard to health care cuts during the 1990s. Let me remind the member and the Conservative government that prior to Jean Chrétien, we were allowing the transfer of tax points as a way to finance health care. During the 1990s, I was in the Manitoba legislature, and we were saying that if that was allowed to continue, the federal government would not be financing health care at all in the future. It was Jean Chrétien, during the 1990s, who established the floor and gave the guarantee of health care funding. </ParaText><ParaText id="3642979">No matter how the Conservatives try to rewrite history, former prime ministers Mr. Chrétien and Mr. Martin are the reason we have health care cash flowing. </ParaText><ParaText id="3642980">However, Canadians are saying that they want more than that. They want to ensure that the five fundamental principles of the Canada Health Act are being enforced. They want the federal government to demonstrate leadership on the health care file. There must be standards. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3642981">Canadians are concerned about the number of doctors in our communities. They are concerned about wait times in our emergency wards. This is what Canadians want the Government of Canada to show an interest in, but it has not done that. For whatever reason, the current <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> does not believe in the health care Canadians want. I find that most unfortunate. We will continue to push this issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="3642982">Grain has been a very important issue over the last number of months in the Prairies and in my home province of Manitoba. I have had the opportunity to talk a lot about grain in recent months, because there is a crisis on our family farms in Manitoba and in the Prairies.</ParaText><ParaText id="3642983"> Imagine having piles of grain in our fields, a lot of it just covered in plastic. Yet we have empty ships in the Pacific Ocean. The problem is that the Conservative government has failed to establish transportation to get that prairie grain to the Pacific Ocean. The people who are paying the price are the prairie farmers, the farmers in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, because the government has not recognized that it needed to take action. Yes, it has taken some action, but the government has fallen short, and it is the prairie farmer who is having to pay the price.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3642984">I could talk about citizenship and the backlog in processing. It is absolutely terrible the amount of time it is taking to process citizenships. </ParaText><ParaText id="3642985"> On crime and safety issues, the government needs to do more in regard to getting tough on the causes of crime and on preventing crimes from taking place in the first place. </ParaText><ParaText id="3642986">As my time has expired, my last thought will be in regard to the size of the budget and the undemocratic actions of the Conservative government. It is wrong the way the Conservative government is compiling so much legislation and forcing it through. That is the reason I have only been given 10 minutes. The Conservatives are forcing things through on this important legislation, which is most tragic.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I too am very dismayed that the bill is being rushed through. After only 25 minutes of debate, the government gave notice to shortchange us on the amount of time we could debate it.</ParaText><ParaText id="3642988">I notice that the budget does not include very much, if anything, on housing. Housing is a critical need in the city of Toronto, in my riding, and in many places across the country. </ParaText><ParaText id="3642989">The Liberals cut federal housing support in the 90s. It was only after Jack Layton convinced Paul Martin to not give corporate Canada a big bonus that we got a little housing money put into the budget in 2005. However, this government has really not done anything for housing. Would the member like to comment?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Lamoureux" id="8301493"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170750" Type="2">Mr. Kevin Lamoureux</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3642990">Mr. Speaker, housing has always been of high interest to me. There is so much more we could be doing to deal with housing programs, housing co-ops, lease programs, and home renovations. People, especially within the middle class, do not have the resources to do a lot of the types of changes that are necessary. Some of those renovations are critical. We are talking about water pipes, electrical work, roof repairs, and so forth. There are wonderful opportunities. If only the government would take an interest in that whole area, we could be doing so much more. </ParaText><ParaText id="3642991">The member made reference to the Liberal administration. I was a provincial critic for housing at a time when I was begging the provincial NDP to provide more for infill housing and renovation programs. They too fell short. </ParaText><ParaText id="3642992"> If we looked at the history of governments, we would see that the Liberal Party takes a back seat to no other party in terms of providing adequate housing. The reason we have literally hundreds of thousands of housing units across the country is in good part because it was Liberal administrations that provided the seed money to make that happen. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mrs. Yelich" id="8301496"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="194606" Type="4">Hon. Lynne Yelich (Minister of State (Foreign Affairs and Consular), CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3642993">Mr. Speaker, the section on creating jobs and opportunities, on page 208, talks about how the government played a key role in addressing the recent economic downturn with housing-related measures in the action plan of 2009. I was parliamentary secretary for human resources at the time, so I know that the $2 billion to create new housing and to renovate existing social housing resulted in more than 16,500 social housing and first nation housing projects across Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="3642994">Through the $2 billion for the municipal infrastructure lending program, CMHC provided 272 low-cost loans to municipalities for house-related infrastructure projects in towns and cities across the country. Our homelessness partnering strategy for housing first, announced in 2013, was renewed. </ParaText><ParaText id="3642995">I just wanted the member to know that if he read page 208, he would see that we have addressed housing. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Lamoureux" id="8301498"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170750" Type="2">Mr. Kevin Lamoureux</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3642996">Mr. Speaker, I am glad the member made reference to that. I would ask her to reflect on the issue of infrastructure when thinking of numbers presented in the budget, because it is a very deceptive budget. Let me use infrastructure as an example. On the one hand, the government says that it is doing such a wonderful job with a huge investment in infrastructure. When one reads the budget, what has the government actually done with infrastructure? It has decreased it. If we look at how much money we have spent on infrastructure last year compared to this year, there is a decrease of 80% plus. That is a cut. No matter what one calls it, a cut is a cut. That is what the government has done.</ParaText><ParaText id="3642997">When the government says that it is doing a wonderful job in certain areas, I would remind people that they need to look at it year over year, such as with infrastructure. When the government says that it has actually increased infrastructure funding, it is not true, when we look at it from budget year to budget year. There is an actual cut. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Casey" id="8301501"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170396" Type="2">Mr. Sean Casey (Charlottetown, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3642998">Mr. Speaker, I am thankful for the opportunity to speak to this budget implementation bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3642999">The government has introduced this bill in order to implement the provisions contained in the budget that was delivered just over a month ago in the House of Commons. The budget was the ninth budget from the former minister of finance, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170343" Type="2">Whitby—Oshawa</Affiliation>. I would like to take this opportunity to wish the minister well in his future endeavours, and to thank him for his service to Canada and his home province of Ontario, where he served for many years in the provincial legislature. The former minister has earned a great deal of respect on both sides of the aisle, including mine. That does not mean that I agree with everything that has occurred since 2006; actually, it is quite the opposite.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643000">There has been much that has transpired since 2006 that has negatively impacted the Atlantic region of the country, my province of Prince Edward Island, and indeed my home city of Charlottetown, a city that is coined “the birthplace of Confederation”. It is a constituency for which I am immensely proud and honoured to serve.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3643001">Canada is an enormous country. Sometimes it is worth remembering just how large it is. It is home to a proud people from diverse backgrounds. We are a country of languages, culture, and geography, but we are bound together by a common citizenship. We have a duty to strengthen the bonds of that shared citizenship, if for no other reason than to enhance our sense of unity. I believe that the Canadian government has a critical role to play in this regard.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643002">When I think of citizenship, I think of rights. I think of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the diversity of our languages, our culture, the anthem, and, yes, hockey. For those reasons and many others, we have managed to maintain, in difficult times and in good times, the sense of Canadian pride. I am further reminded of this as a member of the House of Commons, where I see individuals from across the country, from all parties, all cultural and ethnic backgrounds, attempting to do their best for Canada.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3643003">When I think of citizenship, I think of shared responsibility. A budget, any budget, whether it is a family budget or a federal budget, is constructed on the basis of one's means, the amount of income one has, and the obligations we all have that require certain expenditures. A federal budget provides insight into the values of the government of the day. It certainly provides insight into its priorities. It gives insight into whether or not it seeks to strengthen the spine of our citizenship. Do we craft a budget to leave out the vulnerable, to pit one region against another, to pit one Canadian against another, or do we seek to strengthen the spine of our citizenship?</ParaText><ParaText id="3643004">The Canadian government is the only government with the obligation to act in the interests of all Canadians and, in the case of the budget, to allocate its collective resources in a way that signals we are all equal and we are all to be treated fairly, knowing that every region and province has particular needs. I am sorry to say that much of what the current government has done since 2006 has hurt people. It has hurt good people in my community and province. Much of what it has done has loosened the bonds of unity and shared citizenship. Allow me to give a few examples of what I mean by that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3643005">I believe it is the role of the Canadian government to provide services that are equal and accessible to all Canadians, regardless of where they reside. That, to me, is fundamental. I reject the notion that the role of government is to get out of the way, that there is no role in levelling the playing fields of opportunity. This idea has seeped into our national discourse over the last eight years.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643006">I reject the notion that we are merely taxpayers and not citizens, implying that the only voices that matter are from those whom the Conservatives call taxpayers. We are more than taxpayers; we are Canadians. There is a large number of fellow Canadians who do not pay income tax simply because they do not make enough money to pay taxes. For example, there are seniors who have spent their whole life contributing to Canada and who now, perhaps in the twilight of their years, do not pay taxes because of their low income. Are they any less Canadian? </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3643007">Are the poor to be left out of the national conversation simply because they do not fit the definition of the so-called taxpayer? Is that really the central component of our citizenship? Our shared citizenship is much more meaningful than this myopic view. Unlike the members of the current government, I do not want a government that always gets out of the way; I want a government that makes a difference for all Canadians, not just those who are successful in life or who have means.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643008"> We have a serious issue in Canada as it relates to the incomes of most Canadians, and the widening gap between those who are doing well and those who are living paycheque to paycheque or worse. We do not knock success. We do not knock the people who work hard and have done well in life. Nor should we knock those who have not had the same opportunities in life, who struggle in poverty, sometimes generational poverty. We should not knock those people, then, who look to government to give them a hand up, not a handout, but a hand up. It is a message that we are all in this together and that when a large swath of our fellow citizens find themselves in a vast and wealthy country with little opportunity or hope, we have a duty to intervene, to help create opportunity. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3643009">I am reminded of the great work of community-minded people across the country, and in my hometown, who day in and day out help and advocate for more opportunities for those who are less fortunate. For over two decades, and I include my own party in this regard, we have failed to adopt a real national anti-poverty strategy. Despite the best efforts of the previous government, we did not do enough. We should have a comprehensive anti-poverty strategy, but we will not under the current government, for no other reason than that with the wave of an imperial hand, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada has declared that caring for the poor is a provincial responsibility. It is so myopic and so unwilling to take leadership to make a difference for those in need.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643010">The Conservative government has all but abandoned its role in health care in Canada. In doing so, the Conservatives have abdicated the Canadian government's historic role and responsibility to ensure equal and universal access to health care. That is what I mean by shared citizenship, the programs and the values that drive them and that strengthen our shared citizenship.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3643011">Then there is the matter of unemployment insurance, a program that has been decimated by the current government. In the case of my home province, the recent changes that make it harder to qualify have hurt families, caused hardship and worry. In far too many cases, they have left too many Canadians feeling left out, rejected, or, worse, made to feel like the members of the government think they are lazy or cheaters. Is this the type of shared citizenship that Canadians want or expect from their Canadian government? Is this what Canadians deserve?</ParaText><ParaText id="3643012">What about the matter of infrastructure support and nation building? We embrace today, with a sense of reverence and sentimentality, the notion of nation building as reflected in the railroad, a railroad that linked Canadians from coast to coast to coast. When it was not possible to link islands like Prince Edward Island on land, we were linked by ferry. Or, in the case of another significant investment in infrastructure, we are reminded of the Trans-Canada Highway, again, a big and ambitious endeavour that links Canadians. These great projects helped build, literally and figuratively, this country and provide in part that sense of shared citizenship. The current government has cut its build Canada infrastructure fund by 87%. It is astonishing to think that the Conservatives would allow these cuts to occur and then cynically open the spigot for an election campaign.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3643013"> On Prince Edward Island, we expect that the Canada jobs grant will be exactly like per capita funding for health care, exactly like the civil service cutbacks. The provinces that have less will be penalized and the richer ones will benefit. This has started to play out. We feel kicked to the curb, again. Never in the history of this country have we had such a narrow view of the role of the Canadian government. In the Conservative view, people are on their own. If they succeed, “Great. You're welcome”; if they do not, well that is their fault. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3643014">We can do better and we must do better. This budget is an abject disappointment for the people of Prince Edward Island and Charlottetown.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Lynne Yelich (Minister of State (Foreign Affairs and Consular), CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3643015">Mr. Speaker, I thought it was very kind of the member to acknowledge the best finance minister, probably in the world, that Canada has ever had. I believe it is very honourable that he would mention how because of that finance minister we have one of the best places in the world to do business. We have a stable economy and low taxes. In fact, the overall tax rate on new business investment is the lowest in the G7. We have the soundest banking system, the best net debt to GDP ratio in the G7, and are one of the few countries in the world with the highest credit rating possible.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643016">The member fell short when he spoke about the best finance minister. What he said about infrastructure is false.

We cannot witness the transition from a multi-billion dollar deficit to a predicted multi-billion dollar surplus next year without first acknowledging the efforts of this Conservative government.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643030">With the elimination of our deficit, Canadians can anticipate lower taxes, a higher standard of living, greater opportunities for job creation, and a significantly smaller financial burden on our children and grandchildren.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643031">Canada has already leapt from number six to number two in Bloomberg's annual ranking of the most attractive countries for doing business in the world, just behind Hong Kong.

I know for a fact that this budget addresses four key areas that interest my constituents and other Canadians: the environment, the economy, health and fitness, and search and rescue. I am equally confident that it will reflect the concerns of Canadians from coast to coast.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3643033">We have seen a growing number of Canadians voice their concerns regarding our environment. Today I am proud to tell these Canadians that their government has listened. It is my long-held belief that the economy and the environment are inherently entwined. In fact, in my speech to this House last year, entitled “The environment is the economy”, I relayed the concerns of The Future of Howe Sound Society and other constituents that we must embrace the two in tandem.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643034">Economic action plan 2014 follows the lead of innovative Canadians who continually find ways to stimulate the economy while protecting our natural resources. The economy and the environment are not at war, so the advancement of one should not prejudice the other. This is evident in B.C., where a great number of people, including constituents of mine like CaroleAnn Leishman, have expressed their concerns over proposed pipeline projects, despite their potential economic rewards.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643035">This budget will fund the National Energy Board to review pipeline projects so that Canada's economic pursuits can be reconciled with the protection of its natural resources. Our government will not commit to specific energy transportation projects, but will sustain dialogue with the aim of reconciling economic potential with environmental restraint.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643036">As our <Affiliation DbId="204551" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> recently declared: </ParaText><ParaText id="3643037"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">No project will be approved unless it is safe for Canadians and safe for the environment.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3643038">Energy exports will continue to grow and create many great jobs for Canadians, but the government remains committed to ensuring safe and responsible resource development.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643039">Economic action plan 2014 will also invest in environmental sustainability by protecting Canada's recreational fisheries, so brilliantly championed by organizations in my riding such as the Sea to Sky Fisheries Roundtable, the West Vancouver Streamkeepers, the Squamish Streamkeepers Society, and the Squamish River Watershed Society.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643040">Last year, the recreational fisheries conservation partnerships program received $10 million, and this year the government is renewing its commitment to environmental sustainability, another demonstration of our government's ability to balance both economic and environmental goals.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643041">The recreational fisheries conservation partnerships program commenced last year at the urging of organizations like the ones I mentioned and people around the country who care about the recreational fishery.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643042">I congratulate the member for <Affiliation DbId="170623" Type="2">Dauphin—Swan River—Marquette</Affiliation> for his championing of this program.

							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="35">(1035)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3643044">With our government's devotion to environmental sustainability in mind, Canadians can anticipate more economic progress without great cost to the environment. My constituents in Powell River and the Sunshine Coast and the mayors who have been so powerful in advocating for new jobs, like Wayne Rowe in Gibsons, John Henderson in Sechelt, and Dave Formosa in Powell River, can look forward to adding more jobs in their areas as Canada's economy continues to strengthen.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643045">More than one million net new jobs have been created since the recession. When compared with other G7 nations, Canada's economic performance is among the best, leading the pack in job growth.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643046">In this budget, the government has re-emphasized its desire to find employment for every Canadian and reduce job vacancies.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643047">Internationally, I commend our government for securing free trade agreements with other countries. When our government came into power, Canada had three established FTAs. This number has now grown to 44, including the recent Canada-Korea trade agreement—to which the Speaker has contributed—our nation's first official trade agreement in Asia.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643048">Under our government's leadership, Canada will continue to bolster its economy by trading with other nations in a way that is mutually beneficial.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3643049">Within our borders, our government also commits to the future employment of our youth, through its youth employment strategy. This program aims to provide young Canadians with real-life work experience that aligns with the evolving realities of the job market. We need to ensure that young Canadians can access employment in high-demand fields, like science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and trades. The government has recognized this need and proposed a $40-million investment to support 3,000 full-time internships, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises. Allowing our youth to gain work experience is a worthy investment and a proactive step toward reducing future unemployment and strengthening our economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643050">I am also excited to see how our government has recognized health and fitness as a priority in its 2014 economic action plan, a priority I have championed, to reflect the emphasis on this area shown by my constituents in the Olympic riding.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643051">I applaud the government's initiative to increase the rate of excise duty on tobacco products as a viable method of increasing federal tax revenue. This measure illustrates our government's desire for fiscal responsibility and, more important, for a healthy Canadian population.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643052">This budget also addresses prescription drug abuse, another concern shared by my many Canadians, including West Vancouver police chief Pete Lepine, who has worked closely with me to bring about a national prescription drug drop-off day, which will occur this year on May 10.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3643053">The new economic action plan proposes to invest $44.9 million, over five years, to expand the focus of the national anti-drug strategy, so we can also address this emerging health and safety concern. This investment would serve a diverse Canadian population, by enhancing education on the safe use, storage, and disposal of prescription drugs, among other things.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643054">Having watched our Olympians and Paralympians demonstrate the ultimate in health and fitness in Sochi, I am delighted to see our government's continued desire to support Canadian athletes of all levels. Sport promotes leadership. It plays a vital role in our culture, both as an expression of our national identity and as a means of inspiring more Canadians to become active and healthy. This budget would maintain our government's record level of investment for athletes without leaving anyone behind.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643055">While our Olympians are supported through initiatives like own the podium, our government supports Paralympians, amateurs, and Special Olympics athletes, as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643056">The last provision upon which I would like to touch is the search and rescue tax credit. This commemorates Tim Jones, the amazing revered volunteer who led the North Shore rescue team for 26 years and who participated in over 1,600 rescue operations. The search and rescue tax credit would recognize the important role played by volunteers who put themselves at risk for the sole purpose of serving their communities.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3643057">In conclusion, I see Canada's 2014 economic action plan as another step in the right direction.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643058">Today, I have highlighted four of the many aspects of budget 2014 that are particularly relevant, not only to my constituency but to the whole country: environmental sustainability, economic prosperity, health and fitness, and the recognition of our nation's search and rescue volunteers.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643059">The return to a balanced budget is the fulfillment of a long-term goal. The proposals I have mentioned are examples of our government's commitment to Canadians. It is a good time to be a Canadian. This budget would help ensure good health for our people, our environment, and our economy.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

John Duncan (Minister of State and Chief Government Whip, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3643081">Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to rise today to speak in support of the budget implementation act. This is a very significant budget. There are two things that I would love to highlight in the budget that are particularly meaningful to me.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643082">This year's budget is a major step forward in balancing Canada's books, and its success is a direct result of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s leadership, good judgment, and world-leading economic stewardship. Having created 1.1 million jobs since the recession, today Canada has the strongest job record in the developed world. We have almost balanced the budget, and we have done so while increasing transfers to provinces, investing in infrastructure and skills training, delivering real support for families, and keeping taxes low. This is a remarkable achievement.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643083">For the sake of the members opposite, and particularly for the leader of the Liberal Party, I would like to clarify that balancing the budget did not happen all by itself. It happened because the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has remained focused on the economy and on the priorities of our families and our communities. It happened because we have looked for ways to use taxpayers' money more responsibly and more effectively.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3643084">Even as we have focused on bringing the budget back to balance, we have continued to look for new opportunities to invest in meaningful measures that accomplish a lot with a little. It is two of these measures that I wish to emphasize today. They are two measures included in budget 2014 that are very meaningful for me and for many others, and for which I strongly and actively advocated.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643085">The first is Lindsey's law. In budget 2014, our government committed up to $8.1 million over five years and $1.3 million per year on an ongoing basis to create a national DNA-based missing persons index. </ParaText><ParaText id="3643086">My connection with this issue began in August 2013, when I met Judy Peterson for the first time at a teddy bear picnic in my riding. The picnic was in remembrance of her daughter, Lindsey, and took place in the community where Lindsey had disappeared 20 years earlier, in 1993. By the time this community was added to my riding in 1997, Judy had already moved away. By the time we met last summer, she had been championing a national DNA-based data bank of missing persons for most of the intervening years.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643087">We had the opportunity to talk. She told me about what she has been through since Lindsey went missing in 1993 and how a national data bank would allow the DNA of missing persons to be compared with DNA collected through crime scene investigations. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3643088">I was shocked to learn that without a data bank, every time investigators want to test DNA from a crime scene, they have to ask the family's permission. The family does not have the option of providing blanket permission to compare against an existing sample, so they have to go through the roller coaster of emotions between hope and disappointment every time the cross-reference fails to end in certainty.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643089">Even worse than getting these calls is not getting them. Without a data bank in place, it is much harder for investigators to link an individual crime scene with missing persons. Even when provinces have good cross-checking systems in place, they currently do not extend beyond the provincial border. Even if the missing person's family can have confidence that their loved one has not been found in their own province, there are currently too many barriers to have the same confidence with crime scenes in another jurisdiction.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643090">A national missing persons index would solve these problems. Investigators would automatically be able to run crime scene DNA against the missing persons index all across the country and with other jurisdictions. The families would not have to go through the pain of wondering every time a search was done. In addition, this measure would be an important tool for solving crimes related to missing persons.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="50">(1050)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3643091"> It was impossible not to be moved by this message, and I promised Judy that I would advocate for it in Ottawa. That job was, of course, made much easier by the fact that my colleagues quickly saw the merit in the approach and supported my efforts to move this measure forward. I will admit that when the budget speech was read and I saw Judy in the House of Commons gallery as the finance minister acknowledged all of the work she had done, it was the most memorable and emotional moment of my 20 years in Ottawa.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643092">There was a second item in the budget that was also meaningful to me. I was an early supporter of the idea of the volunteer firefighters tax credit and was proud when our government was able to introduce this measure. However, even from the earliest days I believed that it should also include search and rescue volunteers. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3643093">Over the years, I have gotten to know a number of ground and marine search and rescue volunteers in my riding. I know how dedicated and passionate they are about what they do. They give their time, juggle their training commitments with their family, friends, and work life, and make significant personal investments in gear and training, all so that when the phone rings Sunday night at midnight, they can gear up and head out into the rain instead of going back to sleep. They are volunteers who will not hesitate to head into inclement weather and dangerous environments. They work in rough seas, swift water, high-angle terrain, mountains, and forests. They develop and maintain a high skill level as well as a profound sense of professionalism that is not diminished at all by the fact that they are not paid.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643094">In the early fall of 2013, I was approached by search and rescue volunteers in my riding. They made such a strong case for recognition that I felt I had to take a more active role in promoting a search and rescue volunteer tax credit. Again I enjoyed great support among my colleagues, and together we were able to make it happen.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3643095">The search and rescue volunteer tax credit is not about paying volunteers. It is about recognizing the unique role that search and rescue volunteers, like volunteer firefighters, play in our communities and the sacrifices they make to keep us safe. I am proud of these volunteers in my riding and across Canada and I am happy to see their efforts recognized. </ParaText><ParaText id="3643096">These are two examples that are meaningful to me, but I would like to point out that many items in the budget are there because MPs listened to their constituents and brought their message back to Ottawa. It is a testament to our budget process that items highlighted in the budget speech in front of the nation can begin with a conversation, with consultation, and with thoughtfulness and compassion. </ParaText><ParaText id="3643097">For all that we do here, it is very satisfying to see the ingenuity of ordinary Canadians find its way to the national stage and to know that as members of Parliament, we had an opportunity to play a small role in making important and progressive changes happen.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We are well aware that this is another budget implementation bill designed to sneak in hundreds of changes through the back door, without their being examined properly, for the very partisan and ideological purposes of the governing Conservative Party.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643396">The bill is over 350 pages long and contains over 500 clauses. It changes dozens of laws and contains many measures that were not even mentioned in the budget statement. I would like to point out that, after only 25 minutes of debate, after only one person had a chance to speak, the <Affiliation DbId="170693" Type="4">Leader of the Government in the House of Commons</Affiliation> decided to put an end to the debate by moving a closure motion. That is shameful. It is simply atrocious.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643397">The decisions made in the budget and the budget implementation bill are meant to be made for Canadians. It is their money the government is spending, and it must do so wisely. However, the bill does not address the real concerns of Canadians. It sets out austerity measures that make life less affordable for Canadians. These measures are stifling Canada's economic growth at a time when wages are stagnant, jobs are less stable and household debt is rising and reaching record levels. What is worse, there is nothing in the budget or the budget bill to help the 300,000 additional Canadians who have become unemployed since the recession to find work or to replace the 400,000 jobs lost in the manufacturing sector under the Conservative government. The government needs to think about future generations when making budget decisions.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643398">I came back to politics because my daughters, Sophia and Gabrielle, are now six and four. When I would look at them as babies in their cribs, I remember asking myself what kind of future we would be leaving them. My leader often likes to say that we will be the first generation to leave less to our children than what we ourselves received. We will be leaving them an economic, environmental and social deficit. He is right. The future must be different. In the future, we must live in greater harmony with our brothers and sisters from all countries and in greater harmony with the planet. We need to think about future generations and about preserving that harmony when we govern and make budget choices. </ParaText><ParaText id="3643399">This bill does not do enough to preserve this harmony. We need to focus on new technologies to reduce our dependence on oil, which leads to global conflict and causes environmental degradation. That is why my party supports investing in a 21st century economy based on clean technology.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3643400">This could come in the form of the following measures: restore the eco-energy retrofit – homes program; support the renewable energy sector to help Canada grow and prosper in the new global economy; help the industry take advantage of clean technology markets by supporting research and development for these energies; adopt an action plan to abolish the $1.3 billion in subsidies being handed out to the fossil fuel industry; support specialized training to prepare workers for the green jobs of the future; carry out a study on ways to increase value-added domestic production in the clean energy sector; and lastly, increase access to information and transparency regarding the enforcement of and compliance with environmental legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643401">Furthermore, there is almost nothing in this bill to address the lack of infrastructure in our communities. This bill could have addressed Canada's serious infrastructure deficit by cancelling the $5.8 billion in cuts to local infrastructure set out in the last budget.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643402">We need new infrastructure—roads especially—in Pontiac. We need to work with the provinces and territories to stop the erosion of the municipal tax base by developing a long-term infrastructure plan for cities, towns, suburbs and rural communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643403">Why not invest part of the proceeds from the 700 MHz auction in developing broadband Internet infrastructure in remote rural parts of the country? That could stimulate an entire economy of online businesses. Access to high-speed Internet is critical to small and medium-sized businesses in my region.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643404">The government could also have simplified the process rural communities have to go through to request and receive funding for infrastructure projects. It is not hard to take steps to improve Canada's productivity. The government should update our infrastructure by doubling the gas tax transfer to municipalities. That is a very simple and practical measure. However, in this bill, the government made choices that will benefit only the rich and the biggest corporations in the country. Why do the biggest ones always come out on top with this government?</ParaText><ParaText id="3643405">As the Treasury Board critic, it is my job to criticize choices about services to Canadians.

Even so, this government is determined to cut $36 billion from provincial health transfers. </ParaText><ParaText id="3643407">In addition, the employment insurance reform was really hard on seasonal workers in my riding.

He did a fine job explaining the NDP's concerns over the new budget implementation bill currently before us. I often see him rise in the House and stand up for the interests of his constituents. I want to commend him on his excellent work.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643422">I am proud to join my voice to those of my colleagues to firmly oppose this new omnibus bill. This should come as no surprise from the Conservatives. They do not seem to know how to work any other way. This is the fifth time we are dealing with a such a massive bill and this underhanded approach to avoiding parliamentary oversight. The fact is, everyone here was elected for the same reason. Canadians sent us here to represent them and to stand up for their interests. When we look at the actions of this government and the bills it introduces, we see that it seems to be taking into account only the small percentage of Canadians who voted the Conservatives into power. Unfortunately, our system is designed in such a way that we have a Conservative majority government, but that does not mean that the majority of Canadians voted for the Conservatives. I would say that the majority of Canadians are rather disgusted with the abuse of trust and abuse of power committed by the government. The Conservatives are supposed to be working for Canadians in the best interest of the country. However, that is not what we are seeing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643423">The Conservatives try to hide their regressive agenda from Canadians on a regular basis. Today, we barely heard one speech, and it was a Conservative speech that was far from objective. After 25 minutes, the <Affiliation DbId="170693" Type="4">Leader of the Government in the House of Commons</Affiliation> rose and introduced another time allocation motion. Once again, he could not even get through one half hour of debate. He managed to listen to one of my official position colleagues for barely five minutes and then he said that that was enough, that he knew very well that we would just blame them and shine a spotlight on all the problems with Bill <Document DbId="6483626" Type="3">C-31</Document>. For that reason, we are once again facing closure, which quite frankly is an abuse of the House. I no longer know how many time allocation motions have been imposed, but I can guarantee you that it is a considerable number.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643424">As I was saying, Bill <Document DbId="6483626" Type="3">C-31</Document> is another omnibus bill. It is a massive document with more than 350 pages and over 500 clauses that will amend dozens of laws. Furthermore, the bill would impose a number of measures that were not included in the budget.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643425">Canadians must start learning the cues. The Conservatives use the same arguments with each new budget because it is the same principle every time. They tell us that there is nothing new in there, that everything was in the budget, and so on. They really take Canadians for fools. No one in this country believes them. I do not know who they are trying to convince, perhaps themselves, by repeating the same arguments that are not very convincing. However, quite honestly, no one trusts them.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643426">Canadians also understand that it is impossible for MPs to do a proper job in the short period of time allocated by the Conservatives. I mentioned the size and content of this bill. We have just a few hours to debate it, raise issues and ask the government questions. We rarely get answers but, as MPs, it is part of our job to ask questions and try to get answers. After that, the procedure in committee is rather complicated. Even there, there is very little the members can do.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643427">In any case, it is a known fact that the government does not listen. The opposition could propose an excellent amendment that would remedy problems with this document. Obviously, there are some mistakes in the 350 pages that were hastily thrown together on anything and everything. It takes the government some time. The government will think about it for several months. Time and time again, the opposition will raise the various problems inherent in the government's bills.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3643428">Eventually, someone will say—perhaps in a whisper—that the opposition was right and there is a problem with the bill. The Conservatives are a prime example of this. When they decided to charge GST and HST on the parking revenue of hospitals, the NDP objected. It did not make sense to take that money at the expense of people who are already vulnerable, who are going through difficult times and whose loved ones are suffering in the hospital. The Conservatives told themselves that there was no better way to fill the government coffers and deepen human misery than to take money from the pockets of people who are visiting their loved ones in the hospital.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643429">A few months later, the Conservatives realized that the NDP was right and decided to backpedal. However, it took time. Had they listened to us from the outset, had they been more open-minded and had they not been so uncompromising and demagogic, we would not be where we are today. I would not be wasting my time pointing these things out. </ParaText><ParaText id="3643430">Although Canadians were aware of the problem caused by this government, the government did nothing for months until it could no longer stand the pressure. These are the types of situations created by omnibus bills, massive documents filled with regressive propaganda. I urge all Canadians to flip through this bill. They are in for some nasty surprises. The Conservatives are cutting short debate so that Canadians find out as little as possible about what is in the bill. The Conservatives are preparing for the election in 2015 and they are seeing their poll support plummet across the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643431">It is not just in Quebec that Canadians are starting to push the Conservatives aside and realize that they are not a viable option for ensuring the well-being of our country and equal opportunity for all Canadians. Canada is welcoming fewer and fewer people in need and refugees because of this government's incomprehensible decisions. We are losing our identity bit by bit, an identity that people abroad appreciated and respected, because of measures that the government is hiding in various omnibus bills. That is unfortunate.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643432">I would like to have the opportunity to consult with Conservative members to see if they know what they are voting on. I am certain that the vast majority of them have absolutely no idea what is in Bill <Document DbId="6483626" Type="3">C-31</Document>. It is more than 350 pages long, so I doubt that they have read the entire thing. It is easy for them because the Prime Minister's Office feeds them lines and then they regurgitate them in public. They have done a great job so far.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643433">We in the NDP are insisting on our right to debate in the House and raise our constituents' concerns. We want to do the work that Canadians sent us here to do. The Conservatives are becoming increasingly complacent and do not seem to be taking that aspect of our work seriously anymore. I think it is abusive.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643434">Earlier this week, we moved a motion that clearly criticized the Conservatives' systematic abuse of public funds, specifically in relation to the use of Challenger jets. That is another ethical problem that proves that the Conservatives do not care about the real interests of Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643435">This budget does not contain a single measure to create new jobs. What is worse, it eliminates the small business hiring tax credit that was proposed by the NDP. In my riding, Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier, there are a lot of small businesses. Once again, the government is eliminating a good idea that was proposed by the NDP. It is very easy for the Conservatives to say that we vote against all of their measures. Offering a small gift here and there in an inherently insulting document does not mean that the opposition will vote for the bill. It is outrageous. If I were the Conservatives, I would be embarrassed to use that type of argument to try and discredit the opposition.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Gourde" id="8302024"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="194832" Type="18">Mr. Jacques Gourde (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, for Official Languages and for the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3643436">Mr. Speaker, in her speech on the bill, my colleague did not actually say much about the measures in the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643437">She talked about the process and the number of pages and she was very partisan.

That journey, in the next year, will see a return to balanced budgets here in Canada. What is most important to us as Conservatives is that the journey has taken place without increasing taxes, an approach and a journey that my colleagues on the opposite side, the NDP and the Liberals, would have turned to during the economic crisis. Our government was consistent that we were not going to raise taxes on families, on seniors, or on job creators. So, we have had no tax increases and will have a return to balanced budgets.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643458">I would be remiss if I did not say that one of the key shepherds on that journey has been my colleague, my friend, and my neighbour, in fact, the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="170343" Type="2">Whitby—Oshawa</Affiliation>, who, working with the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and our caucus, ensured that we kept our commitments that we started during the worst of the downturn in 2008-09 to get to a balanced budget and where we are now.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643459">I would like to remind my colleagues in the House where we are now.

Its conclusion was that a revitalized Canadian manufacturing sector will rely on the private sector and that the only role for government is really to promote and support an environment that allows the private sector to flourish.

This last budget is doubling the annual funding for that program over the next two years.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643472"> In my community, before my election to Parliament, I was fortunate to work alongside dedicated volunteers at Valleys 2000 and the Bomanville Creek Anglers Association who, for many years, had been looking at making sure that migrating fish species on the Bomanville Creek could reach their spawning grounds despite dams and obstacles in their way. With funding from this fisheries conservation partnership plan, that group of volunteers in Bomanville has created a fish bypass channel, which, for the first salmon and trout run this spring, will allow those fish to bypass a dam and spawn up creek. I have to thank those volunteers, led by the late Al Strike, Harold Hammond, Reverend Frank Lockhart, Dave Lawson, Steve Kay, Jack Hampsey, and a range of other passionate volunteers from our community who got that program to where it is at. Our government was happy to help complete some of the funding.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643473">As a veteran myself, I have to note that, as stated on page 223, our government maintains its strong commitment to our veterans and their families. With a $108 million commitment to the Last Post Fund, we are taking this funeral and burial program intended for impoverished or indigent veterans and are expanding it beyond its mandate from World War II and Korean War veterans to modern-day veterans so that no one will slip between the cracks. That is on top of our funding increases in the last budget for those services specifically.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643474">The budget also mentioned the Afghanistan commemoration. I will be one of many MPs here who are proud to stand with Canadians for the families of the fallen on May 9, when we commemorate one of Canada's most sustained missions abroad in which over 40,000 of our best young men and women served our country when called upon.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643475">We are also putting a priority on hiring injured veterans. Each year, approximately 1,000 men or women from the Canadian Forces release as a result of injury. We are putting them at the top of the priority hiring list for the civil service, a measure that I hope the opposition and the public sector unions can finally get behind to put those veterans in a place that will make sure they thrive when they transition out of uniform.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643476">We are also putting increased spending into the My VAC Account and other resources so that veterans can access their services.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643477">It is always an honour for me to rise to represent my riding of Durham.

They were very clear that the current government may indeed have put more money into the fund, but nobody can access it. The Conservatives have ensured that the lower limit for accessibility at $12,500 makes it virtually impossible for families of veterans to have access to that money.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643479"> How on earth can the Conservatives brag about something in terms of the money they have provided, when no one can get to it?</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. O'Toole" id="8302068"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="194848" Type="18">Mr. Erin O'Toole</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3643480">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for her work on that committee, and I hope she is listening, because the question gives me an excellent opportunity to show members why this fund is actually structured in a way that targets those in need.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643481">As a veteran, I do not expect decades later to have my funeral covered.

Therefore, that money would lapse and go against the deficit.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643485">My question for the member is twofold.

Well, I would like to let the members opposite know that there will be no change in their speaking notes today. In fact, in question period today it was the same old tired lines from the government.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643491">I will not be supporting Bill <Document DbId="6483626" Type="3">C-31</Document>. Here are the reasons why. I hope my colleagues across the way listen, because they should be ashamed as they listen to these reasons. Given the government's record on time allocation, of course, the bill contains amendments to more than 60 acts without the time to study those changes. It continues in Bill C-31. Once again, we see the despicable Conservative tradition of forcing legislation through without adequate parliamentary debate or public consultation. </ParaText><ParaText id="3643492">New Democrats believe that healthy debate and consultation lead to better legislation for Canadians, yet we have another omnibus bill designed to ram through hundreds of changes with little study and little oversight. In fact, the Conservatives moved time allocation on the bill after just 25 minutes of debate. Canadians deserve better.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643493">In addition, the bill fails to make life more affordable for Canadian families, who are still recovering from the effects of the recession. We have 300,000 more unemployed Canadians than before the recession, on this government's watch. The effects of this are painfully evident in ridings across the country, including my riding of London—Fanshawe. There is absolutely nothing in the budget, or Bill <Document DbId="6483626" Type="3">C-31</Document>, that would assist in getting the hard-working constituents of London—Fanshawe back to work, or to help replace the 400,000 Canadian manufacturing jobs lost on this <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s watch. </ParaText><ParaText id="3643494">There is nothing in the budget or the bill that addresses the reasonable and affordable proposals of the NDP to strengthen the Canada pension plan. There is nothing to provide relief on heating bills, nothing for the millions of Canadians without access to a family doctor, and nothing to address the fact that we still have seniors in our country living in poverty. There are 250,000 of them. </ParaText><ParaText id="3643495">New Democrats are focused on helping our most vulnerable seniors with an affordable increase to the guaranteed income supplement. While the government has made incremental measures in the past, they amount to much less than half of what is needed to pull every Canadian senior out of poverty. It is an amount that is far less than the billions in tax breaks the government has given to banks and big polluters. </ParaText><ParaText id="3643496">Let us look at the history of this government. It is a government that has hiked payroll taxes, while working families struggled with the worst recession in decades. At the same time it was dishing out $21 billion in tax giveaways to Canada's richest companies. It stood by as good jobs with good wages and pensions, like those at Electro-Motive Diesel in London, disappeared as a result of foreign corporate takeovers. </ParaText><ParaText id="3643497">New Democrats would like to see a government that provides explicit and transparent criteria for the testing of net benefit to Canada in the Investment Canada Act, which place emphasis on assessing the impact of foreign investments on communities, jobs, pensions, families, and new capital investments. </ParaText><ParaText id="3643498">New Democrats propose working with the provinces to build a long-term skills training strategy to fill the skilled job shortages and to bring provinces, employers, labour, and educational organizations together to improve existing labour market development agreements. While we are at it, New Democrats would like to see the government sit down with the provinces on issues vital to Canadians, like the Canada pension plan and the Canada health accord, so we can arrive at the creative, affordable, and sustainable solutions we know are possible. </ParaText><ParaText id="3643499">New Democrats would like to see a government that provides the services Canadians rely on. Reverse the devastating decision to cut provincial health care transfers by $36 billion; that would be a good start. The government has put universal health care on death watch. Reverse changes to El that include damaging new rules that would require Canadian workers to accept as much as a 70% pay reduction or risk losing benefits.

New Democrats know that small and medium businesses fuel communities and help those communities to thrive. We believe that continuing to build on the existing job creation tax credit for small and medium businesses would benefit Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643508">While Bill <Document DbId="6483626" Type="3">C-31</Document> would provide for the compensation for deductions from veterans' pay between May 29, 2012, and September 30, 2012, it is silent on the amounts deducted between 2006 and 2012. We have already seen two ministers promise action and then fail to deliver on this issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643509">With Veterans Affairs Canada, the Conservatives cut $225 million out of the budget.

Those organizations, like the last post fund, had their budgets cut in 1995 to reduce government deficits. Those cuts have never been redressed, let alone seen an indexation for inflation, the kind we have seen over 20 years.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643511">I should point out that this is not only the Conservative government's failure. It started with the Liberals, the same Liberals who voted in the past to support Conservative omnibus budget bills.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643512">Those bills in the past included weakening environmental assessment in Canada. Bill <Document DbId="6483626" Type="3">C-31</Document> would do nothing to correct that.

We all know that the budget was introduced a number of months ago now, and there are two process whereby we turn our budget into legislation. Today what we are talking about is the first very important piece of legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643536">When I spoke to the budget a number of months ago, I talked about how we had a plan that started when we first took government in 2006. It was a plan that saw us through the global recession, and we saw how the finance minister followed this plan and was leading us into some of the best positions in the G7, including the best net debt-to-GDP ratio and the best job growth rate. We are incredibly proud of the plan that we had, which saw us through a very difficult time and coming back to a balanced budget.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643537"> That speaks to the three broad themes of this budget: returning to balance, supporting jobs and growth, and supporting families and communities. I will speak to these three themes and perhaps give some small examples that represent those themes, but first I want to make a general statement.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643538">We hear the New Democrats frequently comment about the number of pages. I am not sure if they have challenges and do not want to read those 359 pages, but it is important to recognize that legislatively it sometimes takes a lot of pages to make a little change. </ParaText><ParaText id="3643539">For example, making MP pensions fairer for Canadians was a small change, but it took about 20 pages of legislation to actually do that. I do not think we should be judging a budget document, a plan, in terms of its number of pages. </ParaText><ParaText id="3643540">The other point I would like to make is that I certainly believe that if the NDP, God forbid, ever had the opportunity to present a budget, given all its national plans and tax raises, it would probably fill a bookshelf with national strategy, national strategy, tax increase, tax increase. That is one piece that we need to look at. </ParaText><ParaText id="3643541">Of course, we know that the Liberals would probably have about one page. They know that budgets balance themselves, so one page would probably be sufficient for any budget that the Liberals might decide to present.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643542">Our government realizes that crafting a plan is a multi-year, multi-faceted process, and it requires measures that are both large and small. </ParaText><ParaText id="3643543">First I would like to target why it is important that we return to a balanced budget.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643544">We know that we cannot leave debt for our children and grandchildren. It would not be fair. We would not do it as a family member and we should not be doing it as a country. We also know that when we have a good fiscal position, our debt repayment is low, which means we have more money for health care, hospitals, and all the many things that Canadians feel would add value for infrastructure. When we are not paying a lot of money in debt repayment, we have additional funds to focus in those areas. We know that it gives us the ability to keep taxes low and gives us the opportunity for flexibility and stability.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643545">When we first took government, economic times were good. We paid down $37 billion in debt. We had to provide some economic stimulus during the years, but we are on track to be back to a balanced budget by 2015-16. </ParaText><ParaText id="3643546">Certainly if we look around the world and compare Canada with other countries, we can be incredibly proud. How do we do that? We do it in two ways. We do it on the revenue side. We do it by creating an environment where small and large businesses can thrive and survive and create that economic benefit. We do it through our aggressive trade plan and our trade agreements, such as the South Korean and the European free trade agreements, just to name a couple.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643547"> In the province of British Columbia, my cattlemen in B.C. are absolutely thrilled with the aggressive measures we have taken in terms of what is going to open up new markets for them. They have gone through an incredibly difficult time and they see huge opportunities. It was said by the cattlemen that they now have 500 million hungry customers waiting for them, so creating the environment for revenue is really important. Ensuring that the people pay their fair share of taxes by closing tax loopholes is another part of taking care of the revenue side.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3643548">The expenditure side is another important area. Again, we are looking at the expenditure side very carefully. We are making sure that the money the government spends is very thoughtful money. We are making sure that there is value for dollars, and we have undertaken a number of measures to make sure that compensation is fair. </ParaText><ParaText id="3643549">That was a look at the return to balanced budgets and the importance of returning to balanced budgets.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643550">Now I have just a few comments about some measures for supporting jobs and growth. I will look at one, which is a very tiny measure. We know that in British Columbia, we have a fabulous wine industry. The member for <Affiliation DbId="170448" Type="2">Okanagan—Coquihalla</Affiliation> has a private member's bill to make changes to the importation of intoxicating liquor so that if people are visiting British Columbia from Ontario, they can go to one of those wineries and pick up a bottle from Quails' Gate or another winery and take it across the border. It would really open up the market. Amazingly, in Canada, the ability for interprovincial trade has been constrained for our wine industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643551">In this bill we have given craft brewers and artisan distillers the same opportunities to open up their markets. I will give an example. I used to be the mayor of Pemberton. Pemberton is well known for its seed potatoes and it is known for its pristine glacier waters.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643552">I can remember, when I was there, that for many years people would muse that someone should make vodka in Pemberton. They had potatoes and fantastic water. What a great combination.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643553">Entrepreneurs are out there. It did not happen when I was there, but a family moved to Pemberton, and they had the same thought. They created a new business venture, Pemberton Distillery, and they make Schramm vodka. It was a small entrepreneur setting up a business. What we are doing is opening up their opportunity to sell their product.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643554"> When that kind of environment is created across the country, what we are doing is creating success for our small and medium-sized businesses. Again, it is a small measure, but it is incredibly important in terms of what the opportunities will be.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643555">There is another area we are looking at supporting for opportunities, jobs, and growth. Last week, the Premier of British Columbia was in Ottawa. She was speaking about skilled trades shortages. She was speaking about their goal, which is coming to fruition, of having a robust LNG industry in British Columbia.

We have a need for apprenticeship support. We have done a lot in terms of the apprenticeship program.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643557"> If we look at someone who perhaps is going back into an apprenticeship, he might have a wife and a family. We announced support in this latest budget such that registered Red Seal programs will have access to $100 million in interest-free loans. That is $4,000 per individual per session. That can make the difference for people going back, getting their Red Seal, and opening up their opportunities in terms of the new available jobs throughout British Columbia and Alberta, and of course, across the country. Again, it is important support that is going to hopefully help generate the people we need into the future.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643558">Finally, every one of us, in our offices, have cases that touch us. I had a case of a couple who were not able to have children of their own. They had waited many years and were able to adopt a child. This child was in another country. Of course, sometimes babies do not come according to plan. The baby was born prematurely. The family had to travel to this country to spend time with their newborn. The expenses to spend that time before they were able to bring their newborn back home were extraordinary.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643559">The $15,000 tax credit they could have to support their adoption expenses would make a phenomenal difference.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643560">The crafting of this budget was done with input from Canadians across this country.

My maternal grandfather Narcisse Viens came to Ontario from Aylmer, Quebec. He was a great hunter and a very successful trapper.

							<ParaText id="3643589">Hunting, trapping, and fishing were and are an integral part of life for Canada's aboriginal peoples and our first settlers. Further, the availability of game and fish determined where people settled in this great country of ours.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643590">These activities were the first forms of trade and even currency, and they formed the very backbone of Canada's early financial structures.

I recall my days on the northeast patrol of the Ontario Provincial Police along the James Bay and Hudson's Bay coast, and at the time of year when the geese were returning or leaving, the availability of these migratory game birds sustained communities through some long, hard winters. They supplemented a very expensive diet, and members know how expensive groceries can be in the north.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643592">These activities fuel the economy of our northern communities by attracting more than 400,000 visitors each year.

These activities helped ensure the survival of the first settlers and colonizers who, out of necessity, had to adapt to a sometimes hostile climate and to unexplored territory. These activities are a significant part of our identity as a nation, and it is important to acknowledge that here today.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643620">When I heard about the topic at hand, I had some reservations at first. Given this government's fairly pronounced authoritarian streak, I assumed that the Conservatives would attempt to control the elements and the wildlife. However, I was quite surprised to see that there is an unstated recognition of the impact that human activity has on preserving our resources and the ecosystem. That indicates that the Conservatives are making some progress, and I must give them credit for their change in mentality, their evolving concerns and their shift in position.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3643621">I was apprehensive because what I have learned from others and what I was told growing up in my community was that humans are meant to have little impact on and control over animals, the fauna and the elements.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643622">Upon reading the content of this bill, I could see that it was designed to change human behaviour. Humans really only have control over their own destiny. It is always possible to change the way of thinking of Canadian society as a whole. This is already happening. </ParaText><ParaText id="3643623">I think that all groups that represent hunters and groups that were consulted in the drafting of this bill agreed that it was necessary to protect the resource and to develop ethical and ecologically sensitive practices with respect to animals. That is something positive and that is what I want to talk about today.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643624">The evolution of how Canadians interact with nature covers a wide range of activities that can be categorized by the terms “hunting, trapping and fishing.” These terms cover elements of recreation, culture and tradition, and the economy, as well as scientific and environmental research.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3643625">I just wanted to mention that in passing for your information. I often venture into <I>obiter dictum</I> territory, but I still want to point these things out. <I></I></ParaText><ParaText id="3643626">I want to reiterate that the study and the bill before us can in no way create guidelines for, limit or govern the traditional activities carried out by the aboriginal peoples of Canada. This very specific bill could not in any way limit or even interfere with the traditional activities—including hunting, trapping and fishing—practised in their communities, because those activities are enshrined in the Constitution and are protected. Therefore, the bottom line is that this could not have any effect on those activities. Since the bill states and recognizes the primacy of these activities, I wanted to bring it up today. That is another step in the right direction.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643627">I want to stress that the measures set out in the bill are non-binding with respect to the traditional practices of aboriginal peoples. These traditional activities are virtually immutable because it is almost impossible to regulate them or create guidelines either through this bill or any others.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3643628">Following the stream of thought prevailing in lands occupied by aboriginal communities in this country, hunters, anglers and trappers acknowledge the importance of the ethical treatment of animals and environmentally sustainable activities, all from the standpoint of perpetuating the identity-building practices that have forged Canada's social, economic and cultural history. I have already substantiated those words over the past few minutes.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643629">For example, in Innu communities—I will rely on my own personal experience—from a very young age, when young people are called upon to go out into the forest and follow the group and clan, we make sure they have the information and ancestral knowledge they need to adopt behaviour that, of necessity, is ethical towards animals.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3643630">From a very young age, I already knew that we do not shoot wolves, because, in any case, they cannot be eaten. Although you sometimes do see wolf pelts for sale, my community is rather reluctant about that and does not approve.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643631">There are some practices that are said to be “emulative”, that is, when someone from Uashat or Maliotenam displays questionable or unethical behaviour regarding hunting or the use of pelts, bones or antlers, elders will make sure that person understands that his behaviour is inappropriate and he will be ostracized by the community. This kind of informal regulation has been used by members of the community for thousands of years. It is about maintaining the reputation and the pure, unwavering character of these actions.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643632">It would be unreasonable of me to expect all Canadians to know this information, especially since I come from a predominantly oral culture and, as one might expect, this information is passed down from one generation to the next.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3643633">The bill before us reiterates the same imperative, but that imperative will be shared by all Canadians. Some benefit can be drawn from these teachings that are almost innate or automatic in my home community.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643634">It is beneficial to reiterate the ideals and imperatives regarding the ethical treatment of animals in sport hunting. For the purposes of this study, it is important to point out that the “emulatory” principles that prevail in aboriginal clans most often act as informal ways of regulating traditional practices, particularly through the attachment to animal spirits as a way of self-identifying, which we also try to share with the entire Canadian population for the common good. It would be good if everyone had the same foundation and knew that there is no use shooting a wolf because it is hard to eat the meat. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3643635">With the gradual loss and disappearance of the traditional teachings among the population in general, given the millions of Canadians, it might be hard to ensure that this information is passed on to every hunter and every fisher. That is why we need regulation and the enactment of a legislative tool that would reiterate these imperatives, as is being proposed today, and the establishment of national and international standards of practice to ensure that animals are not subjected to such unethical treatment.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643636">The groups that were consulted and spoke to this issue agreed on the need for ethical and respectful behaviour toward animals because we all know that this resource will have to be available if the next generation wants to follow in our footsteps. Humans can change their own behaviour and their own destiny. We have to wonder when we see a moose head on the hood of a 4x4, something we very rarely see. In any case, I have never seen that in my community. Such a gesture is disrespectful of the animal, and that is why we so rarely see that on an Indian reserve.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3643637">Lastly, I would note that the very text of the legislative instrument constitutes an attempt on the part of the Conservatives to make amends by recognizing the vital importance of measures to protect our fragile ecosystems. Every now and then, they almost impress me by demonstrating a degree of openness at variance with their usual stance.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643638">In the interest of consistency, the Conservatives should also reconsider their economic agenda, which continues to undermine environmental regulations in favour of rapid development in ecologically sensitive regions and areas. The greatest threat to wildlife and human resources, the greatest destructive force, is industrial activity and its impact in terms of the environment and pollution. Hunting and hunters have a negligible impact on the number of animals in a given population.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Jones" id="8302205"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="194231" Type="2">Ms. Yvonne Jones (Labrador, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3643639">Mr. Speaker, I am certainly pleased to rise and speak to the bill that has been put forward by the member for <Affiliation DbId="170175" Type="2">Northumberland—Quinte West</Affiliation>, and to say that of course we on this side of the House will support the motion that he has offered up today.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643640">I am pleased to speak to this on behalf of my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170377" Type="2">Saint-Léonard—Saint-Michel</Affiliation>, who is not able to be here but was a strong supporter of having this designation made. He certainly made a request upon all of us as part of our caucus to support it, and the member did not have to work very hard because, as members know, hunting, trapping, and fishing are really the foundation of how this country was built.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643641"> If we want to look back to the one thing Canadians have had in common through those early years, it was how we participated in the business of hunting, trapping, and fishing from one end of the country to the other, to sustain ourselves, to grow our communities and our provinces, and to provide for our families. Our story in Newfoundland and Labrador is really not unlike any other story that can be told in any province or territory across Canada as to our involvement or engagement in those industries.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3643642">We know that obviously we have transitioned into lots of different industries over the years, and will continue to do so. However, it is very fair to say that in Canada today hunting, trapping, and fishing still remain as core industries that support our economy and our communities and the people of this country in many ways. As most members know, I live in a northern region of the country and I have many trappers in my riding. I have many fishers and fish camps, and a lot of fur farming that goes on. So I am very well informed as to how the industry works and the benefits it brings to the people I represent, as it does to many others across Canada.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3643643"> However, what I also see is the people who spend a lot of time nursing and nurturing the industries and protecting what they partake in. I always find it so very offensive when I hear people who often speak out against some of these industries in which we participate without knowledge and understanding of what it really means or how it is really conducted. I find it very offensive. Just recently, I was told of Ellen DeGeneres and how she has donated money to fight back at the sealing industry in Canada. I was absolutely appalled, because I have not known this person to ever come and sit among the aboriginal people of the north to talk about this industry and what it means to them and how it impacts them. Oftentimes I am very offended when I hear people like this express their opinions and their thoughts without ever looking at the real issue and the real side of the story we are presenting in Canada.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3643644">Going back to the early days in our history, there are many stories to be told around Newfoundland and Labrador, just as we would hear in the Northwest Territories, northern Quebec, and northern Ontario. They are stories of the companies like the Hudson's Bay Company that came and set up in those early days, so that trappers and hunters would have a place to trade their product and to earn a living. Back in those days, the first nations people, who were very nomadic people in Labrador, would always come down into the villages that were settled by the Metis and the Inuit and others, and they would trade with the companies for food, just as the people in the village would do. Even through those years in the commercial fishing industry, my grandfather's stories to me were always about when they first started to trap, fish, and catch cod and salmon. It was never exchanged for money; it was always exchanged for food and for supplies, just as it was in the trapping and hunting industry for many people.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3643645">For most of their lives, that was how business was conducted. There was very little money that exchanged hands, even in Labrador, prior to confederation with Canada. It was only then that merchants would give out money as opposed to just trading supplies and food. There are a lot of stories to tell. </ParaText><ParaText id="3643646">In my region and throughout Newfoundland and Labrador today, there are hunting and fishing associations made up of people who partake in the industry from either commercial or recreational bases; but either way, they are the conservationists. They are the people on the land. They watch what happens with every single animal species. They watch what is happening with regard to the whole ecological system. They also take notes and report anything they see that may or may not seem right or appropriate. They are some of the best conservationists I have ever known and take what they do very seriously, simply because the livelihoods of many of them are still connected to the land and the activities of trapping, hunting, and fishing. It is very sacred and important for them to ensure that there is proper management.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3643647">One of the things I have been very proud of about the people I represent is their ability to meet with environmentalists and scientists and exchange stories and information about how they manage particular species in particular industries. We have seen that a lot in the fishing industry, particularly in Labrador, where a lot of the recommendations for the industry are taken from the input of those closest to the industry. I have been very proud of them when they have said that they see things differently today and want to make sure that quotas are reduced, that there are further protections or that there are zones exempt from any kind of fishing or hunting activity. It is very important that their input is heard because they are, in my opinion, the experts on the ground.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643648">It is important to take this occasion to recognize the importance of hunting, trapping, and fishing to the people of this country, how it comprises the history of who we are, both aboriginal and non-aboriginal, across the country. However, it is also an opportunity to send a louder message to people all around the world that Canadians are nurturers and protectors, people who work hard to make a living, have tremendous respect for their forefathers, and are very proud of who they are and their heritage.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3643649">I am hoping that by designating a day in this country, we will recognize and honour that particular industry, and that it will also become an opportunity to speak to people all around the world about who we are and what we do. It would be a day to honour all of those who built this country through trapping, hunting, and fishing. I am sure that it was not easy in those days, but it was very important.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643650">In concluding my comments, I want to say that people in parts of Labrador continue to honour the age-old traditions, to participate in these activities and be the lead conservationists in protecting the lands, animals, waters, and fish. We are the stewards of where we live and are very proud of that.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I have already had the opportunity to speak in favour of this bill at second reading, but I wanted to reiterate my support.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643652">In my riding of <Affiliation DbId="170119" Type="2">Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier</Affiliation>, hunting, fishing and trapping are a major part of my region's economy. In fact, I invite people to visit my region if they have never been there. </ParaText><ParaText id="3643653">In the past, some preeminent people, including Theodore Roosevelt and Winston Churchill, were lucky enough to come to my riding to go fishing, hunting and trapping. There are some absolutely magnificent pictures on the Internet of Theodore Roosevelt with a rather large moose carcass, hunted in my home town of Saint-Raymond in Portneuf. I am very proud to mention that in the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643654">The tradition of hunting clubs has existed for hundreds of years in my riding. At one time, these clubs were reserved for the Anglo-Saxon elite. Nonetheless, we were lucky. Access to these hunting clubs opened up over the years. Today, Canadians, Quebeckers and tourists can come take advantage of our hunting grounds and explore our magnificent region. Obviously, our many lakes and rivers are also great places to discover.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3643655">Every year, I try to participate in the fishing days that take place in Quebec. I think my colleague's initiative, which seeks to institute a similar day across the country in order to truly celebrate this important part of our heritage, is worthwhile. </ParaText><ParaText id="3643656">My family is not big on hunting. However, my father went fishing many times when I was a child, and I went with him once. Fishing is not really my thing, but I did my part for the conservation effort by stocking one of the rivers in my riding with trout recently.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643657">This type of activity made me truly aware of the importance that our hunters and fishers place on nature conservation and the protection of our wildlife.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643658">I have only one negative thing to say in my speech today. Although this bill celebrates an important part of our heritage and draws attention to the importance that Canadians who participate in these activities place on environmental protection and sustainable development, I find it ironic that the government is making decisions that are completely contrary to these values. I sometimes get the impression that they take hunters, fishers and trappers for granted. That is unfortunate.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3643659">Efforts made in our respective ridings to conserve and protect nature are impressive. For example, in Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier, the hunting season for wild turkey will again open in the spring. </ParaText><ParaText id="3643660">A few years ago, the Fédération québécoise des chasseurs et pêcheurs reintroduced wild turkeys into Canada. We are starting to see the results of this initiative. People can now hunt for turkey, something they had not been able to do for a very long time. In my riding, I regularly see wild turkeys along Highway 138, the Chemin du Roy. It is rather amazing to see how successful this initiative has been. Some species of fish are also being reintroduced into the Jacques-Cartier River, among others.</ParaText><ParaText id="3643661">The Conservative government should copy all these programs. Considering the importance of the diversity of our fauna, it should not be impeding Canadians' efforts. We are spoiled in Canada because our biodiversity is quite impressive.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3643662">The Conservatives' decision to reduce protection for our lakes and rivers does not make any sense. Now there are only 99 lakes and rivers in our entire country that are protected. These kinds of decisions will increasingly limit access to lakes, rivers and wilderness areas for our hunters, fishers and trappers. That is really unfortunate.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="05">(1405)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3643663">Nevertheless, I hope that establishing a national hunting, trapping and fishing heritage day will raise the Conservatives' awareness of the importance of protecting nature and our wildlife. It is a step in the right direction, and I am pleased to see this bill before us. I am proud to support it, but I hope that we will broaden our thinking and adopt concrete measures to ensure that these traditional activities continue in Canada for hundreds of years and generation after generation.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
