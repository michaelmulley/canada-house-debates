The Law Society of British Columbia will allow Trinity law grads to practise in B.C. when they pass their bar exams. However, the Law Societies of Ontario and Nova Scotia have decided they will not let Trinity law grads practise. Surprisingly, the reason is not because of academic standards. The decisions were entirely political. </ParaText><ParaText id="3702809">The Ontario and Nova Scotia law societies simply do not like Trinity's Christian code of conduct for its students. In an age that highly values tolerance, this discrimination is the height of intolerance. It is a clear violation of these would-be lawyers' charter right to freedom of religion. The rule of law requires that law societies treat all applicants equally. Trinity is now going to court to defend the rights of its students. </ParaText><ParaText id="3702810">I call on the Ontario and Nova Scotia law societies to reverse themselves and for the Manitoba and New Brunswick societies, which are considering the issue, to do the right thing.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

However, he was not part of the committee, so I do not expect him to know all of the facts about that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703110">That being said, regardless of what might have happened, perhaps the Chair should restore a sense of order following this incident. Our democracy is held up by a number of pillars, on of which is the Supreme Court of Canada. The separation of powers is extremely important. As lawyers—and I believe my colleague, the <Affiliation DbId="194629" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation>, is a lawyer, just like me—we are required to ensure that we do not tarnish the administration of justice in Canada. Perhaps it is time for everyone to take a deep breath and respect the work we all do, particularly the unimpeachable work of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3703151">I would like to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="170542" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation> for raising this matter as well as the <Affiliation DbId="170693" Type="4">Government Leader in the House</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="204612" Type="7">House leader of the official opposition</Affiliation>, and the members for <Affiliation DbId="181257" Type="2">Toronto—Danforth</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="170256" Type="2">Bas-Richelieu—Nicolet—Bécancour</Affiliation>, and <Affiliation DbId="170750" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> for their comments.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703152">The member for <Affiliation DbId="170542" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation> raised concerns that the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs adopted a motion requiring all remaining questions necessary to dispose of its clause-by-clause consideration of the bill to be put by a specified time, effectively creating a deadline for the debate to end. She argued that this motion contradicts an earlier committee order adopted on October 29, 2013, which gives members from non-recognized parties the ability to speak to their suggested amendments to bills before they are voted on by the committee. Because of the imposed deadline, the member's opportunity to speak to her amendments was interfered with, pursuant to the committee order of October 29, 2013. As such, the member for Saanich—Gulf Islands suggested that substantive amendments, even if already voted on by the committee, should be selected for consideration at report stage. Several members rose in support of the member for Saanich—Gulf Islands' point of order.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703153">The government House leader made two central points in response. First, he reminded the House that at report stage the Speaker's authority to select report stage amendments is limited to determining whether they were presented, or could have been presented at committee. Second, he pointed out that the deadline adopted by the committee affected all members the same way, so it is inaccurate to claim that members from unrecognized parties and independents were particularly penalized in this regard.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3703154">In examining the matter, it is useful to remind the House of the power of the Speaker to select amendments at report stage. To place the matter in its proper context, it is helpful to refer to the March 21, 2001, statement by Speaker Milliken, found at page 1991 of the <I>Debates</I>, which establishes the guidelines upon which I rely to discharge my responsibility to select amendments at report stage. Speaker Milliken was clear in his intent when he urged:</ParaText><ParaText id="3703155"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">…all members and all parties to avail themselves fully of the opportunity to propose amendments during committee stage so that the report stage can return to the purpose for which it was created, namely for the House to consider the committee report and the work the committee has done…</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3703156">These principles are also reflected in the interpretive notes attached to Standing Orders 76(5) and 76.1(5). <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, second edition, further expands on these principles, explaining at pages 783 and 784 that:</ParaText><ParaText id="3703157"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">…the Speaker will normally only select motions in amendment that could not have been presented in committee.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3703158">I would remind all members that the guidelines for selection specify whether amendments could have been presented in committee and whether they were defeated in committee. In the case of the committee's consideration of Bill <Document DbId="6398775" Type="3">C-23</Document>, all members of the committee, as well as any interested independent member, were given the opportunity to present their amendments at committee, and a certain number of these amendments were defeated. The hon. member is now asking the Chair, in exercising its powers of selection, to evaluate whether the consideration afforded such amendments in committee was sufficient.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703159">It is evident that the committee chose to handle its consideration of Bill <Document DbId="6398775" Type="3">C-23</Document> in a particular way. A motion setting out the process to be followed was proposed, debated, and ultimately agreed to. Just as the opportunity to present and speak to amendments was decided by way of a committee motion, the deadline by which debate would end likewise was decided by a committee motion. Such decisions are the exclusive responsibility of the committee. I do not believe that it is for the Chair to second-guess how committees choose to manage their business.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3703160">The hon. member has asked that I select motions for consideration at report stage because she was not able to debate them in committee. In doing so, she referred to a ruling I gave on December 12, 2012, whereby I noted that I would continue to select motions from independent members at report stage until such time as a satisfactory method was found for them to participate in the clause-by-clause consideration at committee. I understand that the hon. member found unsatisfactory the opportunities afforded to her at the procedure and House affairs committee in relation to Bill <Document DbId="6398775" Type="3">C-23</Document>. Other members of the committee echoed they too were not satisfied that certain amendments were not debated once the committee's self-imposed deadline was reached. That said, it remains clear to me that the committee considered and voted on all amendments she is asking me to select.</ParaText>

					<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Scott" id="8345926"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="181257" Type="2">Mr. Craig Scott (Toronto—Danforth, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3703483">Mr. Speaker, we are at report stage on Bill <Document DbId="6398775" Type="3">C-23</Document>, and it has been a long odyssey to this point; one of considerable resistance to the bill on the part of the official opposition; many sectors of Canadian society, including organizations who have engaged in the fight, academics and so on; and also, we suspect, considerable pushback from some Conservatives who themselves felt the pressure from the opposition and civil society.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703484">It is worth recapping how we came to be where we are at.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703485">In March 2012, the NDP tabled a motion, which then received unanimous support from everybody in the House, to call on the government to table within six months—that is, by September 2012—a bill that would address the issue of prevention of prosecution of fraudulent election calls and also add to the powers of Elections Canada, including the power of the Chief Electoral Officer to require receipts and documentation for national parties' election expenses, which, believe it or not, currently the Chief Electoral Officer does not have access to.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703486">Well, six months later, by September 2012, a bill with that sort of focus to clearly deal with this kind of fraud and the need to enhance the powers of Elections Canada to investigate had never appeared.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703487"> By October, it was clear the government was not dealing with the priority it had promised to deal with in voting for the motion in March 2012, and so I tabled a private member's bill with a proposed, and I would say very minimal, system of voter contact registry to deal with fraudulent election calls, as well as a couple of provisions that also went to beefing up the penalties for that kind of fraud.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703488">I told the minister at the time, which is prior to the current minister, that this was effectively to just prod the government and also help it to begin thinking about this issue, because it was clearly having trouble meeting its deadline. I said that I was available to consult as needed and also that I expected that the government, with its resources, it would be able to come up with an even more effective system.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703489">Well, by April 2013, we still had not seen a bill, despite any number of times I stood in this House and asked when we might.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703490">Suddenly the former minister announced to all, in a highly organized press conference on a Tuesday in April, that he would be tabling the missing bill two days later, on a Thursday. The next day we heard rumours, which were confirmed on that Thursday, that this announced bill would not be tabled after all. We will never know exactly what revolt occurred in the Conservative caucus to lead to that result, but we do know that there was a revolt, and the then-minister was replaced with the current minister shortly thereafter.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703491">We had to wait almost a full year after that event, to March of this year, for the bill to finally be tabled, two years after the March 2012 motion when the government had agreed that it would be tabling a bill within six months and 18 months after that deadline passed.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703492">All that time was spent coming up with a bill that we have dubbed “the unfair elections act”, which explains why the first motion at this report stage is to delete the title of the bill, which the government has called “the fair elections act”. We can think of no more Orwellian a title. The government has come close to titles that were equally unrepresentative of the actual contents of bills in the past, but this one, frankly, takes the cake.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3703493">The fact of the matter is that the bill was tabled and within 18 hours, as the critic for democratic reform, I had to be on my feet, having read, analyzed, and formed first views on a 242-page bill to reply to the minister at the start of second reading.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703494">Within very short order, the House leader was on his feet and gave notice of time allocation; time allocation came very quickly thereafter, and very little debate on second reading was permitted.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703495">We then went into the committee stage, where there was an effort on the part of the official opposition, the NDP, to convince the procedure and House affairs committee to allow for hearings across the country in order to hear what Canadians thought. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170251" Type="2">Hamilton Centre</Affiliation> put on a strong filibuster in order to convey to the government how serious we were about this, but ultimately, after 10 hours, he had to concede that the arguments had not penetrated the brick wall.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703496">We went on in committee to have 71 witnesses, only one of whom was completely in support of the bill. It was one out of 71. Most of the others were critical of large swaths of the bill, and where they were focusing only on one or two things, they were extremely critical of what it would do. They included the Chief Electoral Officer, the Commissioner of Canada Elections, the previous chief electoral officer and commissioner, the former auditor general, and indeed Preston Manning, and the list goes on.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703497">Then we found ourselves in a clause-by-clause process that ended up having an artificial end date. We had 10 hours of clause by clause, and by the time the guillotine came down at five o'clock last Thursday, we had gotten through only one-fifth of the 242 pages in the bill, one-half of the bill in terms of the clauses, and only half of the opposition amendments. In terms of the amendments that had actually been debated and, after clause-by-clause study, voted on, not a single official opposition amendment was voted in favour of by the government. This was a total farce of a process.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703498">We looked, in a constructive spirit, at the government amendments, voted for those that made sense, tried to amend as it made sense, came up with some proposals that we thought were absolutely impeccable from the government's perspective, and the Conservative members still decided not to vote with us.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703499">For example, when it was clear that the government was not going to allow the Chief Electoral Officer to authorize the use of voter information cards as a second piece of identification, when it was clear that we had lost that fight, we tabled an amendment simply saying that the Chief Electoral Officer had to ensure that the voter information cards were prominently marked with a message to say that this card cannot be used for purposes of identification on voting day, something that was designed to prevent chaos that might occur in 2015 because of the hundreds of thousands who were able to use VICs in 2011. It was the simplest of amendments and the most constructive of amendments.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703500">The government had an entire night to reflect on it, because the amendment was moved at two minutes before closing hour the day before. The government members took overnight, came back, and said they were sorry, they could not vote for that. This was the atmosphere that we worked in.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703501">It has to be said that the efforts of the official opposition and civil society resistance produced some major accomplishments in terms of the government standing down. The fundraising exception that was criticized across the country was removed. The central poll supervisor provision that would allow the first place party in the last election to appoint central poll supervisors was also removed.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703502">Vouching for addresses was restored in the bill because of the pressure that we put on. Retention of documents—some documents, in any case—under the voter contact registry went from one year to three years. Public education by Elections Canada was now permitted for students in schools, even though for everybody else it remains prohibited, and we at least got on record, although the government refused to put this in text in the amendments, that the Chief Electoral Officer will be permitted to communicate freely on any subject that he wishes.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3703503">These are major accomplishments, and everyone in Canadian society who pushed back with this effort to resist this attack on our democracy, as Sheila Fraser called it, deserves credit for that. </ParaText><ParaText id="3703504">Nonetheless, the remaining issues in the bill are huge. The bill is much worse than the current Canada Elections Act. For that reason, we will be voting against the bill and seeking, as much as possible, to move at report stage the few remaining amendments that are available to us as the official opposition. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It is in essence being pushed out, from my best guess, from the Prime Minister's Office. </ParaText><ParaText id="3703507">The Conservatives call it the fair elections act, but it is far from fair.

At what point do we find our way to drive the point home that we are losing democracy in our country?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Over the next year, it is incumbent on all of us not to allow the Canadian public to forget what the bill is all about and what the struggle to at least make it less terrible than it was when it started was all about. </ParaText><ParaText id="3703513">Indeed, we cannot afford to have another government in power that acts the way this government does. Apart from reminding Canadians of what the vote will mean in 2015, Canadians also have to join with the NDP and the Green Party in making sure we change the electoral system to a system that embraces proportional representation so that this kind of government, elected with less than 40% of the vote but with more than 50% of the seats, can never again do what it is doing to this institution. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It is shameful the way the government has used time allocation to get through its legislative agenda. It is time allocation that takes away the ability of members of Parliament to provide due diligence and provide opinions on important legislation. </ParaText><ParaText id="3703528">It is not that it is offending individuals such as myself as much as it is Canadians as a whole. I have a responsibility to represent thousands of people in <Affiliation DbId="170750" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation>, and collectively, we represent Canadians all across this land. We are charged with the responsibility to stand in our place and debate legislation. This government, more than any other government in the history of Canada, has used time allocation as a way to prevent members of Parliament from standing in their places to deal with important legislation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703529">Ironically, this afternoon we are talking about election laws. That is one of the fundamental pillars of our society. Democracy, freedom, rule of law, all of these are very important. In a couple of days we will be paying tribute to our veterans. Why do they go abroad, whether it is World War II, or World War I, or Korea or Afghanistan on peace missions and so forth, and why do we request our military personnel, both today and in the past, to do this? It is to defend our beliefs. Our fundamental freedoms and democracy are important to Canada, to all Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703530">This is important legislation and the government continues to use its Conservative majority to abuse rights and thereby Canadians in the passage of this legislation. The legislation is fundamentally flawed and should not be passed. The government failed to recognize the need for change.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703531">The government has ignored the advice of Elections Canada's Chief Electoral Officer, former CEOs. In committee we had presentations from individuals like Sheila Fraser. For the first time ever, we had letters that had been signed by 100-plus political scientists from coast to coast to coast in regard to the way in which the government was changing our election laws. It is wrong. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703532">There is a need for the government, when it changes an election law, to build on a consensus, not the tyranny of a majority to force changes to election laws to fit its needs. That is what we see today a continuation of an abusive majority government that does not recognize the important role we have inside the House of Commons to ensure that the laws we pass are done in due course.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703533">This law does nothing to give the strength, in which Elections Canada and the commissioner wanted, to address the issues that Canadians want addressed. I am referring specifically to the ability to compel witnesses. We have been arguing for this, but more important, Canadians, the Chief Electoral Officer and the Commissioner for Elections Canada want the ability to compel witnesses. It is not something completely unique in federal departments.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3703534">More important, from my perspective, there are some provincial entities in Canada of an equivalent nature. Elections Manitoba, for example, already has the ability to compel. Why is the ability to compel so critically important? Just take a look at 2011, whether it is the robocalling, the over-expenditures, thousands of inquiries were made from Canadians from all across this land about issues related to the last federal election.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703535">We need to do what we can to restore public confidence in our election laws at a time when there is a great need to build public confidence based on the last election and the cheating and voter suppression that took place. The way in which to do that is to bring in a law that will have some teeth.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703536"> I was there when the Chief Electoral Officer and the commissioner made their presentations. Canada's election law is getting weaker as a result of the government's failure to address that need in itself.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703537">We have challenged the government to allow for a free vote inside the House of Commons on this bill. We want a free vote on this because we believe that ultimately there might be some Conservatives who believe in democracy more so than the Conservative Party and the attitude in which the government has had toward our election laws. We wanted our committee to travel across Canada to different regions, and the government shut that down.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703538"> The government did not want to go through a genuine debate on amendments. That is why it put in a deadline of May 1, when we saw amendment after amendment being voted on without discussion or debate because the Conservative majority used its majority to prevent that debate from occurring. There was not one amendment that the government passed that was in opposition, unless we take into consideration that it had the same amendment and it was only because the opposition beat it in its submission of it, so it made it a higher priority. The government did not make the amendments that were necessary to make the bill in the best interest of Canada overall.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703539">The government needs to recognize that we have to do more than just change laws based on time allocation and understand and appreciate that there is a process. The Conservative majority government has been abusing its authority in a number of ways. I would suggest that very few are as offensive as what we have before us today. We have a majority government that, without any consensus or genuine consultation, brought in legislation that would change the rules in the next federal election and has failed in building any sort of support.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703540">Everyone who came before committee expressed concern and acknowledged the need for change. Because the government did a bit of tweaking here and there does not justify the disenfranchising that has taken place, the division and the taking out of Elections Canada the Office of the Commissioner, the inability to compel the witnesses, the silencing of Elections Canada—</ParaText>

The answer was that despite the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s claims, the economy was not his top priority. The main thing the Prime Minister is focused on is being able to go into the next election and say that he has eliminated the very deficit that he created in 2008 in order to gain votes. </ParaText><ParaText id="3703594">Because of this, important federal investments are being delayed until after the next election. This is in spite of the fact that action now would generate economic growth and help middle-class families. We saw this when the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> delayed, for two years, his recently announced funding to help first nations children's education. That is a tremendously important investment when fewer than four in ten young aboriginal students even graduate from high school if they live on reserve.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703595">However, Mr. Harper felt that was not as important as his balanced budget target date. Therefore, the funding does not flow until after the next election. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703596">The new Building Canada fund is no different. It is a 10-year plan, which Liberals were happy to see, but it is heavily back end loaded and extremely light on funding until after the next election. In fact, for the next two years, the fund will have only $210 million of new funding a year. If we compare this with the old Building Canada fund commitment for 2013-14, which was $1.7 billion, this has been an 87% cut and it will not be back to last year's level until 2019. That puts projects like the Broadway corridor expansion of SkyTrain at risk. </ParaText><ParaText id="3703597">Mayor Gregor Robertson of Vancouver held a press conference this week to say that the Broadway corridor expansion of SkyTrain must go forward. However, the federal share of this investment may be delayed many years due to the delay in funding for infrastructure by the Conservative government.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703598">Liberal Party members recently passed a resolution calling for major infrastructure investments of up to 1% of GDP. They understand how critically important infrastructure investment is. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703599">UBC generates more than $10 billion in economic activity annually, but the bus-clogged Broadway corridor that goes right through my riding of Vancouver Quadra, is a major impediment to investment in the corridor, according to a KPMG report written recently. A new SkyTrain link from Broadway to Commercial would connect jobs and innovation centres in metro Vancouver, making this one of Canada's most important infrastructure and economic corridors. </ParaText><ParaText id="3703600">As Mayor Gregor Robertson recently said:</ParaText><ParaText id="3703601"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">We will see companies from all over the world coming to Vancouver if there’s good connectivity....The cities we compete with globally in technology are well-connected and are invested in rapid transit, and we need to keep pace. So it will have a nationally significant economic impact.</QuotePara></Quote>
							</ParaText><ParaText id="3703602">This expansion just makes good sense. In the short run, the Broadway corridor rapid transit project will create jobs, jobs in construction, transportation and manufacturing. In the long run, public transit in the Broadway corridor will improve the quality of life and of our air, reduce traffic gridlock and stress, shorten commute times and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. It will increase our productivity and make Canada a more attractive place to invest. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703603">All we need to do is look at the economic benefits of our life sciences and innovation clusters along the Broadway corridor and the important post-secondary institutions, like UBC in Vancouver Quadra, to know that if we act now, we can realize more benefits for greater Vancouver, British Columbia and Canada. Starving the Building Canada fund is not the way to do this.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Since 2006, we have committed over $7 billion in direct funding to public transit infrastructure across the country. In addition to this, during the same period, Canadian municipalities have used over $2 billion of their federal gas tax fund allocations toward transit investments.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703608">Five of Canada's largest cities, being Toronto, Vancouver, Ottawa, Calgary and Edmonton, have directed most of their federal gas tax fund allocations to the public transit category.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703609"> Following on these record investments, our government worked with provinces, territories and municipalities to develop a long-term plan to invest in public infrastructure. As a result of these efforts, this Conservative government delivered the new Building Canada plan, which provides $53 billion for provincial, territorial and municipal infrastructure over a 10 year period. This includes $47 billion in new funding through: the $32.2 billion community improvement fund that supports municipal infrastructure across the country, such as roads, transit, water and waste water systems, and recreational and cultural facilities; the $14 billion new Building Canada fund to support provincial, territorial and municipal infrastructure projects of national, regional and local significance, including public transit; and the renewed P3 Canada fund, with $1.25 billion to support innovative ways to invest in infrastructure projects, providing better value for taxpayer money through public-private partnerships.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703610">Our government launched the new Building Canada fund on schedule, in fact, ahead of schedule by a few days, on March 28. We are also concluding renewed agreements with provinces and territories for the gas tax fund, which we have extended, doubled, made permanent and now indexed at 2% per year, ensuring municipalities have the certainty they need to plan and invest in their infrastructure priorities.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703611">Finally, $6 billion from existing infrastructure programs continues to support public infrastructure.</ParaText>

Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3703620">Mr. Speaker, the question I asked in February remains as important today as it was when asked. The use of CSEC to intercept some passengers transiting our major airports for WiFi communications or any other communications constitutes a form of unwarranted surveillance.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703621">I also referenced the 2012-13 annual report of the CSE commissioner, whose mandate is to provide oversight of CSE. In that report, at page 20, the commissioner stated the following with respect to the issue of whether CSE was operating within the law as the minister claims it did in response to my question on February 3. The commissioner stated:</ParaText><ParaText id="3703622"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">I had no concern with respect to the majority of the CSEC activities...However, a small number of records suggested the possibility that some activities may have been directed at Canadians, contrary to law...I was unable to reach a definitive conclusion about compliance or non-compliance with the law.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3703623">It is interesting that the <Affiliation DbId="194632" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> has failed to address this situation, which flatly contradicts the statement he made to the House on February 3. He said at that point, that report, meaning the 2012-13 report, referring to the commissioner, highlighted that all reviewed CSEC activities were authorized and carried out in accordance with the law. As I just quoted, the commissioner actually said “contrary to law”. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703624"> What the minister said is factually wrong. I hope the minister or the parliamentary secretary will correct that misleading statement this evening. </ParaText><ParaText id="3703625">In testimony before the Senate National Security and Defence Committee on February 3, the chief of CSEC, John Foster, stated that CSEC was “specifically required to protect the privacy of Canadians”. However, he also stated that given the nature in the cyber and telecommunications environment, CSEC “may risk the incidental interception of private communications of Canadians”. How often that occurs was not elaborated on. However, Mr. Foster did make a statement that was of concern, and it goes to the heart of the question I asked the <Affiliation DbId="194632" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> on February 3. Did the minister, under the provisions of section 273.65 of the National Defence Act, give any authorization to CSEC to conduct surveillance operations which could result in the monitoring of communications of Canadians within Canada or of individuals transiting our country?</ParaText><ParaText id="3703626">Given these revelations and the fact the <Affiliation DbId="194614" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> just this week admitted that the agencies under his mandate were in fact involved in telecommunications surveillance in excess of 1.2 million times in a single year, I have to ask the minister to be clear. Did the minister authorize the surveillance of Canadians under section 273.65 of the National Defence Act?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Answer" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Bezan" id="8346648"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="194827" Type="18">Mr. James Bezan (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3703627">Mr. Speaker, I am going to take this opportunity to once again assure all Canadians who are concerned about the activities of the Communications Security Establishment Canada that CSEC's activities are lawful, they are independently reviewed, and they serve to protect Canadians from foreign threats.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703628">The House has engaged in a full debate on this matter, including debating a motion tabled by the member for <Affiliation DbId="170158" Type="2">Malpeque</Affiliation> for a full day back in February. The <Affiliation DbId="194632" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> and the chief of CSEC have also appeared before the Senate committee and the House committee on national defence to outline how CSEC makes invaluable contributions to the safety of Canadians as well as a continued commitment to lawfulness and privacy.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703629">The key facts continue to remain unchanged. CSEC operates within all Canadian laws, including the National Defence Act, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Criminal Code, and the Privacy Act. CSEC is also subject to legislative measures to protect the privacy of Canadians and persons in Canada. By law, CSEC cannot direct its foreign intelligence activities at Canadians, whether they are at home or abroad, or at any person in Canada, and it cannot target Canadians indirectly if it is prohibited from doing it directly, which means it cannot use any of the Five Eyes partners to do any of that work.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703630">CSEC may lawfully assist federal law enforcement and security agencies under their legal authorities, such as applicable court warrants.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703631">CSEC has an effective and independent review body. The CSE Commissioner, an esteemed retired supernumerary judge, reviews all the agency's activities. The commissioner does not take direction from the government or from CSEC, and his office is independently funded by its own budgetary appropriation from Parliament. In order to review the agency's activities, the commissioner is supported by expert staff and external consultants and has full access to CSEC staff, records, and systems.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703632">The commissioner has never found CSEC to have acted unlawfully. In fact, he has specifically noted CSEC's culture of lawful compliance and genuine concern for protecting the privacy of Canadians. Further, multiple commissioners now, all highly qualified judges, have reviewed CSEC's metadata activities. These reviews concluded that its activities are in compliance with the law and subject to comprehensive and satisfactory measures to protect the privacy of all Canadians.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703633">As the current commissioner, Jean-Pierre Plouffe, has noted in his public statements, he is fully aware of CSEC's metadata activities and has the full co-operation of the agency in his review activities.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703634">These are the basic facts, the same as they have been since the member's last request for an adjournment debate back in January. Once again, I would like to take this opportunity to highlight that CSEC's foreign intelligence activities are critical to the ongoing protection of Canadians and Canada's interests. CSEC plays an essential role in protecting our country and our citizens from threats such as terrorism, hostage takers, cyberthreats, and foreign espionage. The work of this agency has revealed plots to attack Canadians and allied personnel overseas before these plans could be executed. CSEC has also helped reveal foreign-led efforts to radicalize and train individuals to carry out attacks here in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703635">In Afghanistan, CSEC's operations were critical in assisting in the protection of our brave men and women in uniform from insurgents. Each and every day, the dedicated men and women working in the Communications Security Establishment work in obscurity and silence to help ensure our nation's prosperity, security, and stability.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We will continue to refine and strengthen safety and security oversight of the transportation system. We will continue to contribute to our government's responsible resource development agenda, and we will improve Canada's competitiveness in critical transportation infrastructure. We will ensure that Transport Canada policies, programs, and activities meet the needs of the transportation system in the long term, and we will adopt our government's efficiency and renewal measures.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703731">I will focus the rest of my opening remarks on our efforts to address a few key areas: tanker safety; investments in transportation infrastructures as part of our gateways and corridors strategy; and, of course, rail safety.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703732">First, I will talk about tanker safety and, specifically, what we are doing to strengthen our tanker safety regime. In the main estimates, members will note that we are requesting additional authorities in the amounts of $15.8 million for world-class oil spill response. This is a 686% increase from the authorities that were sought in last year's main estimates. The tanker safety regime is based on three pillars: first, we prevent spills from happening in the first place; second, we clean them up should they happen; third, we hold polluters accountable and financially responsible for those spills. This regime introduced new measures such as increased inspections of foreign tankers in Canadian waters, expanded air surveillance and monitoring of ships in our waters, and a new incident command system to allow the Canadian Coast Guard to respond more effectively to incidents.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703733"> To help achieve a world-class tanker safety system, we struck an independent expert panel led by Captain Gordon Houston, the former CEO of Port Metro Vancouver. The panel submitted its first report in November and it made 45 recommendations on how to strengthen the oil spill preparedness and response regime. We take this advice very seriously. Therefore, we are engaging communities and first nations, the marine industry, and provincial governments on the panel's recommendations. However, the panel's work does continue. It is currently reviewing oil tanker safety measures in the Arctic, as well as marine transport of hazardous and noxious substances.

We are going to double the funding for this aerial surveillance program, and that is going to allow this team to increase the number of hours the planes are in the air, and then they can better monitor our coasts and ultimately deter potential polluters, and catch a spill before it becomes too big.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703735">Economic action plan 2014 recognizes the importance of trade and investment to Canada's economic future, and the role of Canada's transportation infrastructure network in supporting trade in domestic and international markets. Through the main estimates, we are seeking $702 million to support important infrastructure projects through the gateways and corridors funding program. The program supports international trade with the United States and other key partners by ensuring integrated and efficient transportation systems across all modes. We have to work with other levels of government and private-sector stakeholders, and together we are both investing in important infrastructure products at border crossings and bolstering our efforts to coordinate infrastructure planning as part of government's beyond the border initiative. Improvements to cross-border trade will go a long way toward ensuring continued economic growth for Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703736">Finally, I would like to turn my attention to what my top priority is, and that is strengthening rail safety in this country.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="55">(1955)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3703737">This past January, the Transportation Safety Board released three interim recommendations regarding its ongoing investigation into the Lac-Mégantic train derailment. The recommendations addressed three factors: the vulnerabilities of the DOT-111 tank cars used to transport crude oil, the need for emergency response assistance plans, or ERAPs, along routes where large volumes of liquid hydrocarbons are shipped, and the requirement for route planning and analysis for trains carrying dangerous goods.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703738">On April 23, we provided our response and we outlined our actions going forward to directly and decisively address these recommendations. The Government of Canada is committed to continued collaboration with industry, other levels of government, and various stakeholders.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703739">Well before the events at Lac-Mégantic, rail safety issues were already being addressed by our government. In May of last year, amendments to the Railway Safety Act came into force that strengthen the safety requirements for rail companies in Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="3703740">As well, we have worked for years to maintain safety for pedestrians and vehicles around grade crossings. New safety regulations were recently published, and this year the federal government's grade crossing improvement program is providing more $9 million to improve safety at over 600 railway crossings in this country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703741"> I also feel strongly in this case that Canadians should not be expected to cover the costs of damages. To this end, Transport Canada has consulted stakeholders on how to strengthen the existing liability and compensation regime for rail. This way, in the event of an accident, sufficient resources would be available to adequately compensate victims, pay for cleanup costs, and protect taxpayer funds. This complements recent consultations by the Canadian Transportation Agency into the insurance coverage it requires of federally regulated railway companies when they issue certificates of fitness to the companies.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703742">When it comes to addressing the recommendations from the Transportation Safety Board, I want to stress that we are committed to improving railway safety and the transportation of dangerous goods by rail. </ParaText><ParaText id="3703743">Following the accident in Lac-Mégantic, the federal government took immediate action. The measures I announced in April build upon this work and further strengthen our country's regulation and oversight of rail safety in the transportation of dangerous goods. I will just remind the House of these measures.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703744">We first acted to remove the least crash-resistant DOT-111 tank cars from dangerous goods service in general by directing the phase-out of tank cars that have no continuous reinforcement of their bottom shell. There are about 5,000 of these cars in North America.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703745">We are also improving the tank cars that are used to transport crude oil or ethanol to significantly reduce the risk of these substances escaping if the cars are involved in an accident. In January of this year, Transport Canada published a revised mandatory standard for consultation, requiring thicker steel, head shields, and top-fitting protection. All DOT-111 tank cars that do not meet this January 2014 standard must be phased out or refitted within three years if they are to be used for the transportation of crude oil or ethanol.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703746">We will also implement even more stringent tank car requirements in the future, based upon industry recommendations and technical discussions that are ongoing with the United States. In fact, Canada is already committed to meeting or exceeding all U.S. requirements for DOT-111 tank cars.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703747">The second Transportation Safety Board recommendation that we are addressing is in relation to emergency response assistance plans. These are formal plans that describe what industry will do to support first responders in the event of an accident involving dangerous goods that require special expertise and response equipment.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703748">To ensure we are prepared in the event of a rail accident, the federal government will require rail shippers to develop emergency response plans for higher-risk flammable liquids. In the event of an accident involving significant quantities of these dangerous goods, approved response plans will give first responders access in a timely manner to the resources and the assistance that they need. To accomplish this, we have issued a direction to require shippers to develop emergency response assistance plans for crude oil, gasoline, diesel, aviation fuel, and ethanol when even a single tank car is loaded with one of these designated flammable liquids.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703749">We will also establish a task force with key partners and stakeholders such as the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs and the Aboriginal Firefighters' Association as well as key response, shipping, and railway representatives. This task force will provide a dedicated and collaborative forum to enhance coordination of response capability. We will also consider expanding response plan requirements for other class 3 flammable liquids after reviewing the matter with this task force.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703750">Finally, Canada already has a strong regulatory regime for trains travelling in both rural and urban areas. Transport Canada has now introduced even stricter requirements for trains transporting dangerous goods in order to safeguard communities along our railway lines. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="00">(2000)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3703751">We issued an emergency directive requiring railway companies to immediately slow trains that transport dangerous goods and implement other key operating practices that respond to the TSB's recommendations. The emergency directive adapts the recently announced U.S. voluntary requirements to the Canadian rail network, requiring companies to make key operational changes quickly.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703752">We will make these requirements permanent by issuing a ministerial order that requires railway companies transporting dangerous goods to develop new rules on these operating practices. It is a major undertaking that requires careful planning in order to deliver rapid and concrete results.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703753">In conclusion, the initiatives I have outlined today demonstrate clearly how our government is working to maintain transportation in Canada that is safe, secure, efficient, and environmentally responsible, and we take this responsibility seriously.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I just could not wait to get started on this wonderful speech that I have for the House. It gives me a chance to offer congratulations on the minister's birthday a second time, so that is a good thing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703829">As I started out to say, I want to talk about Canada Post but I want to acknowledge at the outset that it is an arm's-length crown corporation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703830">First, let me deal with the financial situation at Canada Post. It is undeniable that the business of delivering mail has evolved at a remarkable rate, especially with the incredible popularity of electronic mail, but whether we talk about individuals, business, or governments, everybody has to live within their means. This is as true of me and my family as it is of the government or of Canada Post. Canadian families know they cannot continually spend more than they earn. Business and governments are no different. Canada Post will not receive government subsidies to operate in an unprofitable fashion. It must adapt, as we all have to. </ParaText><ParaText id="3703831">That said, the throne speech highlighted our government's unwavering commitment to control spending while investing in Canadians' priorities to safeguard our economy. Year after year in budget after budget, we have put in place credible plans to achieve financial sustainability and set clear targets to bring our deficit down.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703832">This was crucial as we dealt with the damaging effects of a worldwide recession, one of the worst in more than seven decades. We had to get our fiscal house in order to keep Canadians working and our economy growing. The proof of this commitment is in the results. I remind the House that one of minister Flaherty's greatest legacies will be a balanced budget in 2015.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703833">More than just managing debt, our government is tackling spending. We are reducing the size and the cost of government to ensure taxpayers get good value for money. We are working hard to make government more efficient and responsive to the needs of Canadians. This is because of our overreaching goal to create the conditions for jobs, economic growth, and long-term prosperity for all Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703834">We are the envy of the world. Three credit rating agencies, Moody's, Fitch, and Standard &amp; Poor's, have reaffirmed their top ratings for Canada. Both the International Monetary Fund and the OECD expect Canada to be among the strongest growing economies in the G7 this year and next.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703835">Reducing spending, lowering taxes, and paying down debt are enabling us to seize new economic opportunities as we promote free trade and innovation, the keys to job creation, economic growth, and prosperity. I lay out these facts to underline that these same truths apply just as much to Canada Post as it faces unprecedented challenges.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703836">One need not be a learned scholar to judge the trends in the fiscal forecast of Canada Post to see where the trend leads. A 2013 report prepared by The Conference Board of Canada into the corporation's future projects that unless major changes are made, annual operating deficits will reach nearly $1 billion by 2020, that is $1 billion per year. That is certainly a deficit that requires significant and immediate attention.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703837">While many Canadians will admit they use mail less and less, some are quick to point out the popularity of parcel delivery. Could this not be a promising area of business growth, they ask? Absolutely it can. The parcel market is increasing as more and more Canadians are making online purchases. E-commerce helped parcel volumes grow by about two million pieces in the first nine months of 2013 compared to the year earlier. Canada Post parcel revenue was up 11.2%, which amounts to $32 million from the third quarter of 2012. However, I believe the minister could confirm that parcel revenues are simply not enough to compensate for mail volume declines. </ParaText><ParaText id="3703838">Consider that in 2012, total transaction mail revenue amounted to $3 billion or 51% of the corporation's operating revenues. Parcels on the other hand accounted for less than $1.3 billion or 22% of operating revenues. Even though parcel volume is projected to increase by 26% by 2020, it will not be enough to get Canada Post out of the red. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="25">(2025)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3703839">Quite simply, the corporation's current business model no longer allows it to earn sufficient revenues to offset its cost. Without changes, the future viability of the postal service is in question.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703840">As the minister has highlighted in this place many times before, the challenges of Canada Post have arisen in part because of the global recession. The pace of postal decline has been accelerating in Canada and other developed countries for a number of years. However, it has accelerated after the global recession began in 2008.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703841">Companies cut their mailing costs as part of overall cost reductions. Many opted to ship more billing statements and marketing online. At the same time, individual consumers began moving en masse from traditional to digital communications. Canadians are now more likely to send a text message or an email than to take the time to write a letter, post it and wait several days to be delivered.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703842">As the minister has noted many times, mail volumes per address have dropped by nearly 25% between 2008 and 2012. In fact, more than one billion fewer pieces of letter mail were sent last year than in 2006.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703843">The U.S. Postal Service has reduced service hours and the number of employees to address financial pressures, for instance, while the U.K. has privatized and significantly increased stamp prices. Not to mention, neither of these countries presents the same unique challenges that our northern communities presents.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703844">The digital economy is not going away. Canada Post has no option but to find new ways of doing business to keep its operation sustainable. Canada Post must manage its business prudently. It has no choice. It has a mandate to operate on a self-sustaining financial basis. Financial responsibility is a legislated obligation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703845">The services currently provided by Canada Post are clearly no longer affordable. The corporation needs to spend within its means in the same way that individuals do as they manage their family budgets. More than that, change is essential if Canada Post is to keep pace with the choices Canadians are already making about the way they prefer to communicate.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703846">Since delivery accounts for about 40% of Canada Post's operation costs, it is the most obvious place to start.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703847">Door-to-door delivery is by far the most expensive mode of delivery. It costs between two and three times what it costs to deliver to a community mailbox. Compare $283 annually for home delivery versus $108 for community mailboxes. They are also cheaper than delivering to a rural mailbox, which rings in at $179 per year.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703848">To be clear, we are talking about changes affecting only home delivery. Businesses with large volumes of mail or located in business zones will generally retain their door-to-door delivery. However, the remaining one-third of Canadians still will have door-to-door service. The minority of people in our country, I would add and I am one of them, will gradually shift over the next five years to community mailboxes instead. Community mailboxes provide secure mail storage in a convenient place close to home to receive parcels and packages.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703849">Remember that Canada Post introduced community mailboxes back in 1981, so it has been successfully delivering mail and packages this way for a very long time.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703850">The corporation is expected to reduce its workforce by between 6,000 and 8,000 positions by 2019 and this will be achieved largely through attrition, which will help reduce its overhead dramatically. Like most workplaces populated by baby boomers, many will leave the workforce in a few years' time.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703851">In closing, I have a question that I would like to pose for the minister. I hate to present her with such a tough question, but although it is tough, it is fair. I was hoping that the minister would inform the House on the current crisis facing Canada Post and the government's commitment to ensuring that it does not become a burden on taxpayers, because the taxpayers are up to here with unnecessary costs. Please explain what we can expect the post office to do to rein in these costs?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Lisa Raitt (Minister of Transport, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3703852">Mr. Chair, I thank the hon. member for his insight into a topic that we certainly must understand better.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703853">In 1981, Canada Post was set up as a crown corporation. In its documents, it was done so to ensure that postal services, financial security and independence continued. That is exactly what we are trying to do today by accepting Canada Post's five-point plan for moving into the future.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703854">The reality is twofold. First, Canada Post has to actually deliver to more mailboxes or to more addresses than before. It is increased by 1.2 million. Second, Canada Post, as well, is delivering fewer letters. In fact, most Canadian families only buy two stamps a month. That is significant.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703855">It is clear that the five-point plan is something Canada Post has researched, has consulted on, has studied and has indicated is its best path forward for achieving financial self-sustainability along with the continued service provision that it needs to do.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703856">I appreciated the words of my hon. friend when he talked about the costs associated with community mailboxes. In terms of trying to ensure that we have a delivery system that is efficient and cost-effective, it is important to note that the door-to-door service to one-third of Canadian households is $298 on an average annual cost per address. However, delivering to a community mailbox is $113 on an annual cost per address basis.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703857"> That is a significant savings. It is one of those kinds of savings that Canada Post has looked at to ensure Canadians will continue to receive mail on a daily basis, which is what it said it wanted to do. At the same time, what it also said was it wanted to ensure it was not relying upon taxpayer dollars. That is what Canada Post is attempting to achieve.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

What it says in the title is that the plan will return system to financial sustainability by 2019 and ensure continued role of enabling trade and commerce.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703860">It is looking at areas of growth. The hon. member mentioned those, and one of them, of course, was parcel delivery. As indicated, with the increase in the amount of addresses Canada Post has to deliver to and the lack of letter mail that is delivered, it does have to do other things.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703861">In its five-point plan, it lays out certain things it would like to do. The main initiatives are these: over the next five years, convert the remaining one-third of Canadian households that receive their mail at the door to community mailbox delivery; that it has a new approach to pricing letter mail to take effect, which has happened; that it expands convenience through postal franchisees; that it streamlines it operations; and that it does address the cost of labour.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703862">As was pointed out by the hon. member, it is worthy to note that the average age of a current employee of Canada Post is 48 years old, almost my age today. Canada Post expects that nearly 15,000 employees will retire or leave the company over the next 5 years. That is more enough, in its view, to allow for the reduction of between 6,000 and 8,000 positions, mainly through attrition. </ParaText><ParaText id="3703863">It is taking a legacy company and turning it around for the future, meeting the needs of Canadians and doing so in a financially self-sustaining manner.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It was designed to realign how it delivers and prices postal services to meet Canadians' emerging and future needs while substantially reducing costs to the taxpayer.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703926">This is a watershed moment for Canada's national postal service. Letter mail volumes have been declining since 2006, when Canada Post delivered 1.2 billion more letters than it did in 2013. That is a big number. The corporation estimates that for every 1% drop in mail volume, it loses $30 million in revenue. This is placing a huge strain on Canada Post's finances, as witnessed by losses of $129 million, before tax, in the postal segment alone in the third quarter of fiscal year 2013. It is quite clear that the services, as currently provided by Canada Post, are no longer sustainable.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703927">Canada Post must now manage its business as a viable commercial enterprise that competes effectively in every product line. Even its traditional direct marketing business is facing digital rivals that use mobile and smart technologies, and the parcel business operates in a highly competitive environment. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703928">The corporation is well aware that to build on recent successes, it must attract customers in an increasingly complex economic environment. The parcel business, unlike letter mail, is highly competitive, and parcel volumes have been rising worldwide. Postal services in many countries have been aggressively using their extensive sorting and delivery infrastructure to expand in this sector. Globalization has more parcels coming into Canada to be processed to the same high standards, and the highly competitive parcel delivery market means that service providers must modify operations in order to win and retain customers with the quality and reliability of their service. In the business of the customer parcel delivery market, that means providing fast, reliable, and convenient delivery, excellent tracking options, and reasonable prices. </ParaText><ParaText id="3703929">The growth in the parcel industry has also intensified local and global competition. FedEx and UPS, for example, have increased their competitive positions in Canada. Customer patterns have also shifted from premium to less urgent products that cost less. The increased competitive landscape has put increased pressure on Canada Post to manage costs, improve product offerings, and provide a superior customer experience. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703930">With approximately 40% of parcel deliveries to Canada originating internationally, Canada Post has negotiated bilateral agreements, notably with the United States and China, to increase its share of this inbound traffic. The corporation has also made extensive investments in new facilities, including a 700,000 square foot plant at Vancouver International Airport. It has increased real-time tracking through portable scanners for employees and has added to its capacity for motorized delivery to handle growing package volumes. </ParaText><ParaText id="3703931">Canada Post also offered on-demand parcel pickup for small businesses in 2011 and 2012. It provided enhanced web services for online retailers, including seamless management of returns. </ParaText><ParaText id="3703932">I wish to emphasize that the government is committed to ensuring transparency in how Canada Post provides quality postal service to all Canadians, rural and urban, individuals and businesses, in a secure and financially self-sustaining manner. That is why the government established the Canadian postal service charter in 2009, which set out its expectations regarding Canada Post service standards and related activities in providing postal services that meet the needs of Canadians.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703933">An important aspect of the postal service charter is its commitment to universal service that ensures that Canadians in both urban and rural areas can send and receive letter mail and parcels within Canada and between Canada and elsewhere. As part of Canada Post's continued commitment to parcel delivery, parcel services to Canadians living in rural and northern communities not currently serviced by competing parcel delivery companies will have significantly wider access to, and the ability to return products from, Canada and around the world.This is crucial for the many rural and northern communities not currently served by private sector courier companies. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="55">(2055)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3703934">Canada Post's five-point action plan embraces the principle of reform without seeking any change to the Canadian Postal Service Charter. This plan is about giving Canadians the postal service they need in the emerging digital economy. Canada Post is quite aware of the changing face of the postal industry and has been preparing for a future with less mail and more parcels for a number of years.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703935">The corporation has implemented measures to expand its parcel volume both through its postal operations and through its Purolator courier service. For example, changes to internal operations first begun in 2010 have made for a more efficient flow of parcels through the network to the customer. Canada Post has launched an aggressive plan to invest in replacing its aging processing infrastructure and delivery processes with more modern and cost-effective approaches driven by technology. The sorting equipment in place today is much faster and more accurate. From a delivery perspective, it has meant a massive shift toward motorization. </ParaText><ParaText id="3703936">Canada Post will continue to leverage these investments. Doing so will further reduce the cost of processing the mail and will allow the company to better serve the growing parcel market and provide the services Canadians will need in the future.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703937">In many urban areas, Canada Post has moved away from letter carriers delivering mail by foot to carriers who leave their depot every morning with a fuel-efficient van containing the mail and parcels for delivery on their route. Putting mail and parcels in one truck for delivery provides a better end-customer experience, especially in the parcel business, at a much lower cost to the corporation. These improvements will allow Canada Post to compete more effectively in the fast-paced and technology-driven global parcel market. All kinds of parcels are now flowing through Canada Post sorting plants, including items that depend on fast and accurate delivery, from health care products and gourmet food to live bees and baby chicks.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703938">Canada Post realizes that the parcel business is highly competitive and it does not have the exclusive privilege to deliver parcels, as it does for letters. Therefore, the corporation has focused on providing a superior customer experience, recognizing the attachment Canadians have to their parcels. Canada Post has indicated a desire to expand en-route pickups and launch a comprehensive returns solution that will benefit e-commerce merchants and shoppers by improving inventory management, returns processes, and automatic billing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703939">An important component of Canada Post's proposed strategy is its intention to build upon its current strength in parcel delivery, which has demonstrated growth over the past few years thanks in large measure to the fast-growing market of online shoppers.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703940">It is clear that Canadians have become enthusiastic online consumers. Statistics Canada reported in October 2012 that the value of orders placed online by Canadians reached $18.9 billion in 2012, up 24% from 2010 when the survey was last conducted. That is 24% in two years. More than half of Internet users, 56%, ordered goods or services online in 2012. Perhaps even more encouraging, most Internet shoppers, 82%, had placed an order from a company in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703941">Canada Post's parcels line of business currently offers a range of domestic and international delivery services and is the largest player in the Canadian parcel market, with more than 50% market share. The corporation sees an unprecedented opportunity for additional growth linked to e-commerce as online business activity increases. Customers for parcel services include businesses, consumers of all sizes, governments, international postal administrations, and other delivery companies. </ParaText><ParaText id="3703942">According to a recent report by the Conference Board of Canada, residential and small business customers indicated that their demand for parcel service will continue to rise with the spread of e-commerce.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="00">(2100)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3703943">Parcels are the fastest-growing line of service in the core Canada Post business. The corporation reports that overall growth in parcel volumes experienced a record-breaking holiday season, which runs between November 11 and January 4. Canada Post delivered 30 million parcels during this period, which was five million more than the holiday season last year. The corporation delivered more than one million parcels in a day, on 10 different days. Weekend delivery was also very successful. Canada Post employees delivered a total of 1.1 million parcels over the six weekends of the holiday season, with the highest number of deliveries occurring on the December 21–22 weekend. That is 317,000 deliveries.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703944">The main reason behind this growth is that parcels are the one postal product that has seen growth driven by the digital revolution. Canada Post advises that its top-25 retail customers are making major e-commerce gains. January parcel volumes from these retailers shot up 35% compared to January of last year. This dramatic increase follows a highly successful holiday season in which year-over-year parcel volumes from this top-performing group grew by 50%.</ParaText><ParaText id="3703945">It is very obvious that things and times change. They have certainly changed at Canada Post, and it has tried to adapt.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3703946">I have a question for the minister. The opposition is refusing to see that Canada Post is facing a new digital reality.

These port authorities handle a significant amount of Canadian trade, approximately 310 million tons of cargo valued at more than $162 billion annually. On the whole, Canadian port authorities contribute about $24.5 billion to the Canadian gross domestic product and provide almost 269,000 jobs for Canadians.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3704032"> Port Metro Vancouver is the largest and most diversified port in Canada. It is also the fourth-largest tonnage port in North America. In short, the port is a major economic force that facilitates trade between Canada and more than 160 world economies, and handles 19% of Canada's total trade. The operation of Port Metro Vancouver is complex, and it is key to Canada's overall supply chain. The port's operations involve many different enterprises, including cargo terminals, cruise terminals, shipyards, railways, trucks, and shipping agents. In addition to facilitating trade, one of the most significant economic benefits the port provides is direct and indirect employment, not just for British Columbia but for other provinces as far away as our own home province of Ontario.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704033">A recent study of the economic impact of Port Metro Vancouver showed that its ongoing operations support 38,200 direct jobs in British Columbia. The direct impact of this employment on British Columbia's economy is estimated at $3.5 billion in gross domestic product, $8.5 billion in economic output, and $2.3 billion in wages. The indirect impacts of the port's operations on businesses in British Columbia are even more impressive: 76,800 jobs; $6.7 billion in gross domestic product; $14.5 billion in economic output; and $4.6 billion in wages. These indirect impacts include tourism revenues related to cruise-ship passengers.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3704034">The majority of direct employment generated by the operations of Port Metro Vancouver is located within the Lower Mainland area. However, there are also close to 10,100 off-site jobs supported by the economic activity of Port Metro Vancouver. This off-site employment represents about 22% of total direct Port Metro Vancouver businesses' employment and reaches through western Canada and beyond. Outside of British Columbia, the largest direct employment impact is in Alberta, followed by Ontario. This includes supporting 2,700 direct jobs in Alberta and 1,600 direct jobs in Ontario. Members can see the vital role that Port Metro Vancouver plays in securing our country's long-term prosperity.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704035">For those who do not know, Port Metro Vancouver operates across five business sectors: automobiles, breakbulk, bulk, containers, and cruise. Based on data from 2013, Port Metro Vancouver handled 135 million tons of cargo, a record for the port, with an overall increase of 9% over 2012. Import and export tonnage maintained balanced growth, each showing a 9% increase.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="25">(2125)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3704036">The port is leveraging the strong performance with significant capital investment intended to further increase its competitiveness. This investment will further contribute to the port's economic impact on the regional and national economies.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704037">By 2022, Port Metro Vancouver has identified $1.4 billion in capital investment to further increase its performance. This additional economic activity is generated by expenditures associated with Port Metro Vancouver's current capital program and by the capital investments of Port Metro Vancouver's tenants. Together, in pursuing this capital investment plan, Port Metro Vancouver and Port Metro Vancouver tenants will create an estimated total of 2,800 direct person-years annually, with a potential total impact of 6,100 person-years of employment.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704038">As others have noted in this place before, our government has worked to improve supply chain efficiency, reliability, and security so that Canada stays competitive in the continuously evolving world of global commerce. For example, we launched the Asia-Pacific gateway and corridor initiative and, to date, we have invested $1.4 billion in Asia-Pacific gateway projects in partnership with all four western provinces, municipalities, and the private sector. Many of these projects form a critical portion of a supply chain that also includes Port Metro Vancouver.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3704039">Furthermore, under the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s leadership, our government is making unprecedented investments in infrastructure, solidifying a pivotal base in much of our transportation network through, of course, our new Building Canada plan. Key transportation assets, including port infrastructure, will be eligible for funding under the $4-billion national infrastructure component of the plan, which is earmarked for projects of national significance.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704040">Given that efficient and reliable operations at Port Metro Vancouver are critical to Canada's Asia-Pacific gateway and the national economy, the Government of Canada recently took action to support the resumption of trucking operations at Port Metro Vancouver. The estimated economic losses to Canada during the recent work stoppage were estimated at $126,000 per day. We found this unacceptable and acted quickly to develop a joint action plan in conjunction with the Province of British Columbia and Port Metro Vancouver to bring stability to the container trucking industry. The plan contains 15 points for implementation and provides a framework for long-term stability in the container trucking industry. All parties are working together to implement the plan with input from key stakeholders.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704041">Our government is committing to removing roadblocks to prosperity, which is why we acted quickly to bring stability to the industry, diminish wait times, and prevent disruptions in the future. For example, the Government of Canada brought in new regulations to increase the rates paid to truckers at Port Metro Vancouver.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3704042">As you know, Mr. Chair, our government's focus is to create jobs, growth, and long-term prosperity for all Canadians, but we cannot achieve these goals on our own. Port Metro Vancouver is Canada's largest and most diversified port, remains critical to our national transportation and trade system, and it could not be clearer that our government is committed to ensuring the reliability of Canada's Asia-Pacific gateway and the economic well-being of this great country.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704043">As I conclude, I have an important question for the minister. Given the topic of much of my remarks, could the minister please update the House on our government's various actions with respect to the recent situation at Port Metro Vancouver?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The port handled $172 billion worth of cargo in 2013, a total number of jobs 100,000, with 38 million metric tonnes of coal or 40% of the total black cargo in 2013. These are all important things.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704046">The specific question with respect to the trucks and the containers is one that is of great importance to us.

In doing so, a number of strong actions were taken. One of them was moving out of the Canadian ports corporation and into these free-standing, independent, self-financed, self-regulated port authorities, and it has been an incredible success when we look at what has been accomplished in moving to that model. We have seen an increase in productivity in the transportation sector of over 30%.

Marine transportation, in particular, plays a significant role in our ability to trade with international partners and to ship goods around the world. At a time when global trade and connectedness are increasingly necessary for economic growth, it is essential that marine activities be carried out safely and in an environmentally sound way.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704121">This evening I would like to highlight Transport Canada's marine safety programs by providing a brief overview of their scope and purpose. These programs directly support the department's mandate for safe transportation as well as the Government of Canada's priority of having safe and secure communities. </ParaText><ParaText id="3704122">Marine safety programs establish regulatory requirements that are harmonized with international standards for the safe and environmentally responsible operation of vessels in Canada. Marine safety also carries out compliance oversight activities, such as inspection and certification services, to help ensure compliance with requirements.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3704123">Requirements apply to the construction and operation of both commercial vehicles and pleasure craft and include the training and certification of seafarers who operate and maintain them. The effective implementation and management of these programs mean the Canadian public can have confidence in the marine sector in this country.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704124">One key program is the domestic vessel regulatory oversight program, which is responsible for helping ensure that substandard Canadian-flag vessels do not operate. Inspection and certification activities are carried out by highly qualified Transport Canada marine safety inspectors or by representatives of qualified organizations that have been granted delegated authority. Under the delegated statutory inspection program, Transport Canada has entered into agreements with certain classification societies to perform statutory vessel inspection and certification functions.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704125">Small commercial vessels, which make up a significant portion of the Canadian fleet, have unique safety and operational requirements that are addressed in a new program known as the small vessel compliance program, or SVCP. The SVCP helps inform the owners and operators of small commercial vessels of their regulatory obligations under the Canada Shipping Act, 2001, and to verify that their vessels meet them. This new program has proven to be a very successful way to enhance the safe operation of these vessels and to increase compliance.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3704126">Port state control is a ship inspection program that inspects foreign-flagged vessels in our waters. It is a way to ensure that foreign vessels calling at Canadian ports comply with major international maritime conventions, thereby enhancing safety and protecting the environment.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704127"> Transport Canada is also the lead federal department responsible for Canada's marine oil spill preparedness and response regime. This regime is in place to mitigate the impact of any marine pollution incidents in all Canadian waters. In this area, the department collaborates with Fisheries and Oceans Canada, the Canadian Coast Guard, and Environment Canada to ensure preparedness and response to oil spills. </ParaText><ParaText id="3704128">One important aspect of this regime is the national aerial surveillance program, or NASP. The program conducts aerial surveillance over all waters under Canadian jurisdiction using three aircraft with state-of-the-art remote sensing equipment that is so sensitive that it can detect marine oil spills as small as one litre. The information gathered is used to support enforcement action against polluters. Last winter, the minister actually participated in one of these surveillance flights. She saw first-hand that this is a very successful and worthwhile program.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704129">As members are aware, our government is taking action to prevent marine oil spills from happening in the first place, to clean up spills quickly and effectively if they do happen, and to ensure that polluters pay. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="00">(2200)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3704130">The hon. Denis Lebel, in his prior capacity as Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities, and the hon. Joe Oliver, in his prior capacity as <Affiliation DbId="204551" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation>, announced the strategy to implement the world-class tanker safety system in March of last year. This is a comprehensive interdepartmental strategy, led by Transport Canada, that includes initiatives by Environment Canada, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, the Canadian Coast Guard, and Natural Resources Canada. With respect to preventing oil spills, we have put forward legislative amendments under Bill <Document DbId="6254809" Type="3">C-3</Document> that would increase government oversight of oil-handling facilities, address issues of immunity for response organizations responding to a spill at one of these facilities, and strengthen requirements for pollution prevention and response at oil-handling facilities.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3704131">Other steps we have taken for which Transport Canada is responsible include increasing inspections of foreign tankers, reviewing existing pilotage and tug escort requirements, and launching the process to designate the Port of Kitimat public, which would require port traffic-control measures.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704132"> We have also expanded the coverage of the NASP to provide even better aerial surveillance. In addition, the Canadian Coast Guard has invested in new and enhanced aids to navigation that will help mariners avoid accidents and prevent oil spills. Our government has also taken action to better prepare for and respond to marine oil spills if they do happen. The Canadian Coast Guard has moved to establish an incident command system to respond more effectively to any incidents by coordinating the operations of partners. Environment Canada has completed a study into the behaviour of diluted bitumen. This work has increased our understanding of the potential effects of spills on marine ecosystems.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704133">We have also created the tanker safety expert panel to identify how the existing marine oil spill preparedness response regime can be further strengthened. The minister is now considering its recommendations on the current regime south of 60, and looks forward to the panel's second report on the regime in the Arctic and the marine transport of hazardous and noxious substances.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704134">These are major steps, and I am proud that our government has delivered on the promises announced last year.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3704135">Finally, I would like to remind the members that marine safety is about more than just commercial shipping. We must also address recreational boating. Transport Canada's Office of Boating Safety, or the OBS, delivers programs that focus on prevention and that provide vital information for users and builders of recreational boats to enhance safety and reduce the environmental impacts of boating. Through the OBS, Transport Canada provides funding to organizations that promote boating safety or research ways to change people's behaviour on the water. These organizations have helped increase the number of boaters who follow safe boating practices. They also have contributed information about boating incidents that makes it possible for the OBS to set objectives to help reduce fatalities, injuries, and damage to property as a result of boating accidents.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704136">The goal of the programs and measures I have outlined this evening is to help ensure that Canada benefits from the most effective marine safety system possible to protect people and the environment. Canadians can be confident that the minister's and Transport Canada's efforts are helping to make the marine transportation system in our country among the safest, most efficient, and most environmentally responsible in the world.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I would also note that next week is Safe Boating Week, and I think it is important that we remember safety in recreational boating too. People should wear their life jackets and make sure they have everything they need to have on board for recreational boating.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704141">I had the opportunity, as the hon. member said, to take a flight with the national aerial surveillance program. This is a unique program. The United States does not have this program. We have invested in this program, and we will make sure we invest in it more so that they can actually increase the number of hours they are out there patrolling the skies and being our eyes in the skies.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3704142">Specifically, I was particularly pleased to note that two members of the crew were women, so they have a nice gender balance in this program. It was very nice to be able to take off with them and to have the ability to view the paths of the vessels in the Vancouver area and to see the equipment they have, the sensor ability they have, the technology they have, and the skills they have to see both ships that are in distress and any spills, even as little, as was mentioned, as a litre of oil, because having that quick response is incredibly important.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704143">I thoroughly enjoyed my time. We did not, unfortunately, see anything there with respect to any potential spills, but I can vouch for the absolute professionalism and the abilities of the crew on board this plane.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3704144">One other thing the crew told me was that it is such an incredibly valued program that they were the ones who were called upon by the United States to go down to the gulf to help be the eyes in the skies for the movement of oil on water when they had the <I>Deepwater Horizon</I> disaster, the oil spill in that part of the world. I am very proud of the work they did there and the commendations they have received as a result. We are very happy to make sure we continue to fund this program and increase the funding in the program so they can deliver not only on the west coast but also in the Arctic, and of course, on the east coast of Canada as well.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Part of that is with marine shipments. We know that as we increase the number of marine shipments through the west coast or the east coast, we will be faced with increased risk. </ParaText><ParaText id="3704147">We want to ensure that we are ahead of that. That is why we asked for a panel, chaired by a very well-respected captain, Captain Gordon Houston, who used to be the chair and CEO of Port Metro Vancouver, to look at what we currently have in terms of response and in terms of the system to take a safe system and make it even safer. He and his panel had 45 recommendations for the government, and we are taking them under due consideration and are ensuring that we consult with communities and get to the right place.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3704148">The importance of the world-class tanker is not just whether we are doing things as best we can for Canada. It is our reputation as well. It is world class for a reason. We are leading the world, when it comes to this kind of development, in ensuring that our marine transportation is as clean as possible and as safe as possible, and in the case of a spill, that we can respond to it as quickly as possible. The final piece is that the polluter is the one who pays and not the Canadian taxpayer.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

They were put into the hands of local communities through a ground lease to ensure that the development, the management, the marketing of these airports were done by local community members on a smaller scale, and it has proven to be very successful.

I want to review for Canadians a number of the Auditor General's key findings and conclusions.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704169">First, the Auditor General and his team audited a three-year period at Transport Canada, which is this minister's department. She is the fifth minister in eight years, transiting through, I guess in terms of this cabinet, either up, down, or out. </ParaText><ParaText id="3704170">However, the Auditor General's report on whether federal railways have actually implemented safety management systems states that “Transport Canada has yet to establish an audit approach that provides a minimum level of assurance that federal railways have done so”.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704171">That is number one, which flies in the face of the minister's assertion that there are SMSs as a world-class system in place.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704172">Two, on safety, the Auditor General says that Transport Canada does not have clear timelines. The report states: “We found that the work plans are vague in terms of timelines for monitoring progress on important safety issues”.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3704173">Three, critical information is not available at Transport Canada. It cannot deliver up risk assessments. It cannot give us information on the sections of track used in transporting dangerous goods; and I think of Lac-Mégantic. It cannot give us information on the condition of railway bridges. It cannot give us financial information of privately owned federal railways not publicly available.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704174">The Auditor General then tells us that Transport Canada, in the three fiscal years that were audited, actually only performed 14 audits. That is 14 audits when they themselves said that only constituted 25% of the audits that they said had to be done in order to keep rail safe in this country. In fact, in that three-year period, VIA Rail, which carries four million passengers a year, was not audited once. </ParaText><ParaText id="3704175">Not once.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704176">I asked the minister earlier about qualified inspectors. In 2009, Transport Canada said that it needed 20 system auditors to audit each railway once every three years. How many were in place? There were only 10, half of what is required.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704177">Next, the Auditor General tells us that Transport Canada does not know whether its current staff of inspectors have the required skills and competencies to do their jobs: “Inspectors and managers were not trained on a timely basis”. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3704178">The Auditor General says that they cannot even warrant that inspectors are objective and independent because they are coming from the private sector and mainly from federal railways.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704179">This is a scathing indictment of the last eight years, and five ministers, on rail safety. However, when we listen to the minister speak, all is good with rail safety, apparently. </ParaText><ParaText id="3704180">Can the minister explain to Canadians how it is possible that these findings are so serious that at committee, the Auditor General stated clearly that he is going to be adding another interim report to examine how much progress has been made under the current government.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We also did not examine the overall safety of Canada’s rail industry”.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704182">I stand by my comments about the safety of our rail industry and the importance of making it safer.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704183">With respect to the recommendations, we did thank the Auditor General for his report and his recommendations because, clearly, a 26% audit is unacceptable. That is why the department was asked for a rail safety Office of the Auditor General action plan, which I have a copy of. The department is marked against it in terms of benchmarking. It has provided complete timelines; timely completion dates, which are needed; and it is monitored by me and my office on an ongoing basis. </ParaText><ParaText id="3704184">With respect to audits and auditors in training, in the spring of this year, all 100 inspectors will have the ability to conduct audits and they will be trained up.

					<Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Toet" id="8347132"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170541" Type="2">Mr. Lawrence Toet (Elmwood—Transcona, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3704199">Mr. Chair, I too would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the minister's birthday today and wish her the best. Hopefully she will have a much better celebration in one of the nights to come, because this is not a great way to celebrate one's birthday.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704200">That being said, Canada's rail system has been central to the development of this country. There are some 48,000 kilometres of track, enough to go around the world. We have one of the largest rail networks on the globe.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704201">Rail has connected Canadians to each other and, by transporting Canadian goods to markets, is crucial to our economic prosperity. Some 70% of our surface freight moves by rail, including bulk commodities such as agricultural and forestry products, minerals, and energy products, including oil.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704202">In recent years, more than 40% of our gross domestic product has been generated by bulk commodities. We use rail to move what are called dangerous goods. Dangerous goods play a vital role in the North American economy, but they are substances that could pose a threat to people or the environment. These shipments include oil and gas.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3704203">Every day such shipments move routinely and safely across Canada by rail without incident. Canadians depend on many of these goods to go about their daily lives. In fact, more than 30 million shipments of dangerous goods are transported annually in this country. Let me note again that almost all their destinations are reached without incident.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704204">However, this past summer a tragic incident did occur. On July 6, an unmanned Montreal, Maine and Atlantic train containing crude oil derailed in Lac-Mégantic, Quebec. The explosion and fire that followed killed 47 people, caused significant damage to the town, and released more than five million litres of crude oil. The events in Lac-Mégantic underline the ongoing need for rail safety.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704205">An on-site investigation was immediately launched by the Transportation Safety Board of Canada. The TSB provides an extremely valuable service to the government and Canadians. It operates independently of the government and makes recommendations following investigations into transportation incidents.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704206">Earlier this year, the TSB made interim recommendations based on its ongoing investigation into the tragic Lac-Mégantic incident. Our government took decisive action to address the TSB recommendations.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3704207">Just recently, the <Affiliation DbId="194617" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> directed her department to further strengthen rail safety in Canada by removing the least crash-resistant DOT-111 tank cars from service; requiring DOT-111 tank cars that do not meet the standard published in January 2014 in <I>Canada Gazette</I> part 1 or any other future standard to be phased out within three years; requiring emergency response assistance plans for even a single tank car containing crude oil, gasoline, diesel, aviation fuel, or ethanol; creating a task force that brings municipalities, first responders, railways, and shippers together to strengthen emergency response capacity across the country; and requiring railway companies to reduce the speed of trains carrying dangerous goods and to implement other key operating practices.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704208">However, I should note, given the integration of Canada and U.S. rail networks, that rail cars cross the border both ways every day, so we also require a North American solution. When it comes to developing a new standard for rail cars, we do not exist in isolation and must consider our training partners in the United States.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704209">As such, the <Affiliation DbId="194617" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> continues to work with her American counterpart to accelerate the development of even more stringent standards in keeping with the TSB recommendations.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3704210">In addition, here in Parliament the minister has asked the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities to review safety management systems for railways and the transport of dangerous goods. I mention this because I want to point out that Canada has in fact paid attention to safety in rail transportation. Those who say otherwise need to examine the facts.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704211">In addition to the actions I have mentioned, our government is also taking other steps to address this important issue. On sharing TDG information with municipalities, the minister has stated that our government remains committed to a two-way dialogue and information exchange with key transportation stakeholders in communities across Canada. A protective direction was issued to make sure this happened.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704212">On classification of dangerous goods, the minister announced a directive to ensure that all crude oil being transported is properly tested and classified and that results are sent to Transport Canada.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="30">(2230)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3704213">This provides Transport Canada with an additional means to monitor industry compliance and focus our efforts for the greatest safety benefit of Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704214">When we look at all these actions together, we can see that our government is taking an approach that is similar to the world-class tanker safety initiative that we developed for marine transportation. It focuses on prevention, response, and liability. </ParaText><ParaText id="3704215">Our government is committed to rail safety and, prior to this tragedy, took numerous other actions to strengthen it. It is worth noting some of them. </ParaText><ParaText id="3704216">In 2009, we increased funding to ensure a permanent rail inspectorate of over 100 positions nationally. By last spring, Transport Canada had 101 railway safety inspectors and 35 dangerous goods inspectors. It has implemented a new, aggressive staffing plan to increase oversight capacity. For example, between April 1, 2012 and March 31, 2013, rail safety inspectors conducted more than 30,000 inspections. Our government has also invested more than $100 million in the rail safety system. </ParaText><ParaText id="3704217">We have also taken legislative steps. Last year, final amendments to the Railway Safety Act went into effect, providing the authority to introduce new regulations to strengthen safety and oversight programs. These new regulations include increased fines for companies that break rules, a requirement that rail carriers submit environmental management plans, the creation of whistle-blower protection for employees with safety concerns, and a call for rail companies to have an executive legally responsible for safety.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3704218">I want to also note other measures we took immediately following the events in Lac-Mégantic. The<Affiliation DbId="194617" Type="4"> Minister of Transport </Affiliation> directed her department to issue an emergency directive to rail companies, with five requirements: two operators are required at all times for trains carrying dangerous goods; all cabins must be locked; all reverses must be removed from locomotives; all brakes must be properly applied on all locomotives; and no trains can be left unattended without new strict conditions. Our government made these rules permanent. </ParaText><ParaText id="3704219">These actions would build on steps that Transport Canada is also taking to bolster the safety of our rails and the transportation of dangerous goods. To this end, we have said we will work to enhance the collection of safety data and the tools to analyze safety risks and improve and expand the fleet of vehicles used to assess rail tracks. We will improve how information about dangerous goods shipments is shared with municipalities, conduct research to support safety technologies, promote a culture of safety in the rail industry, and continue to work with communities across Canada and groups such as the Federation of Canadian Municipalities to further support the work of municipal emergency preparedness officials and first responders.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3704220">We also continue to strengthen rail safety through other actions. That is why, even before the investigations into this tragedy were completed, the minister directed officials in her department to speed up development and implementation of regulations that reflect recent amendments to the Railway Safety Act. In doing so, there are several questions we need to consider. For example, do our current regimes and options adequately reflect risks of transporting crude oil and other dangerous goods? As we did in developing the world-class tanker safety regime, should we reassess the liability and compensation regime for rail transport to better protect victims, the environment, and taxpayers? </ParaText><ParaText id="3704221">Given the integration of the Canada-U.S. rail network, and in order to improve rail efficiency together, we should work to develop a new continental co-operation on rail safety. </ParaText><ParaText id="3704222">As I noted earlier, we are already doing some of these. </ParaText><ParaText id="3704223">As a first step, the Canadian Transportation Agency is reviewing its insurance assessment criteria and will take actions permitted under existing legislation. As well, Transport Canada will review how much insurance may be required in order to adequately compensate people and pay for cleanups after accidents. From that, we expect to bring forward options to improve this regime and ensure it adequately reflects the risks of transporting crude and other dangerous goods. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3704224">Beyond what government can do with its own powers, we must also encourage transportation businesses to encourage a culture of safety in their everyday operations, and the sense among employees that they can all contribute to safe operations. By accomplishing this, these businesses can maintain government's trust and have confidence that we will support their enterprise. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="35">(2235)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3704225">In conclusion, let me make a couple of key points. First, railway safety regulations exist to ensure the safety and protection of the public. If these regulations are not followed, we will not hesitate to act, and if companies do not properly classify the goods they transport, they may be prosecuted under the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act. </ParaText><ParaText id="3704226">Second, Canada has a robust and safe transportation system, one in which we can have confidence. The facts demonstrate that Canada is pursuing rail safety and that our record has improved in recent years. However, events in Lac-Mégantic remind us that we must remain committed to strengthening rail safety. To do so, we will learn from recent events and work with all stakeholders in rail transportation to ensure the safety of our rail system for Canadians. </ParaText><ParaText id="3704227">We recognize that there is still some work to do, and we remain committed to working with the rail industry, governments, and partners such as the Federation of Canadian Municipalities to improve the safety of our rail and transportation of dangerous goods systems.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704228">With that, I have a question for the minister. I was wondering if the minister could comment on whether, in light of what I have said in my speech, she is confident in the direction we are taking and whether it will maintain the safety of our transportation and trade system.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

This begins the all-important response by police, fire, and ambulance personnel to the scene of the incident. Without this vital safety link, Canadians’ lives would be placed further at risk.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704315">That is why our government recognizes the importance of proper first responder capability and has provided assistance to municipalities to ensure that Canadians have access to the support they require following an incident related to the transportation of dangerous goods.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704316">For example, our government has allocated funding to support municipalities, and a portion of that funding is being provided by Public Safety Canada toward helping in the response and recovery in Lac-Mégantic.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704317">By their very nature, the vast majority of emergencies in this country are dealt with at the local level; by provincial, territorial, and municipal governments. Under Canada's emergency management system, first responders and provincial officials are responsible for addressing the immediate needs of their residents in times of disaster. However, the federal government can and does play an important role through the disaster financial assistance agreements, particularly when communities are devastated by a large-scale natural disaster.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3704318">These arrangements were put in place to provide financial assistance to provinces and territories, on a cost-shared basis, when response and recovery costs for a natural disaster exceed what they could reasonably be expected to bear on their own. Through this program, our government has provided more than $2.5 billion in post-disaster assistance to help provinces and territories with the costs of response and of restoring infrastructure and personal property to pre-disaster condition.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704319">However, as we learned last summer, our communities can be shattered by incidents that do not fall into the category of large-scale natural disasters. The unprecedented nature of the Lac-Mégantic tragedy was such that our government was compelled to find an exceptional and rapid funding response. In the face of such a devastating and immediate impact, it was clear that there was no time to waste. The priority was to deliver immediate help to the people whose lives had been ripped apart. With its commitment to provide $60 million to the province of Quebec, that is exactly what our government did. Since then, we have also provided up to $95 million to help with the decontamination of the water and soil.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704320">In addition, to help meet this extraordinary need, Public Safety Canada committed to provide $25 million of the total funds, to help the Province of Quebec in its immediate response and recovery efforts, as well as to help repair, rebuild, and restore this devastated community.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3704321">The funds provided could be directed to a number of eligible costs, which would include: the delivery of emergency services; rescue, transportation, and emergency food and shelter; the registration of people who were displaced from their homes due to the destruction; incremental short-term security measures, including removing valuable assets and hazardous material from the sites; emergency provision of essential community services; the removal of damaged structures that constituted a threat to public safety; repairs to public infrastructure, such as roads and bridges; and finally, the cleanup costs.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704322">Since this announcement, our government continues to work with officials in the Province of Quebec and Lac-Mégantic to ensure that provincial requests for federal assistance are handled without delay. The health and safety of Canadians is our government's top priority, and this funding is just another example of how we are working closely with the provinces and territories to assist Canadians when large disasters strike.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704323">We continue to support first responders to make sure they have access to information that may assist them in dealing with an incident. </ParaText><ParaText id="3704324">That is why on November 20, 2013, my colleague the hon. <Affiliation DbId="194617" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> took action to make sure that municipalities and first responders have access to information about dangerous goods that flow through their communities. This government has obligated industry to provide municipal emergency planners and first responders with the information they need to conduct proper risk assessments, emergency planning, and first-responder training.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="00">(2300)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3704325">Moreover, the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act, 1992, provides the federal government with the necessary authorities to develop policy, verify compliance, conduct research to enhance safety, guide emergency response, and develop regulations and standards to manage risk during the transportation of dangerous goods.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704326">To further help municipalities deal with an emergency, the transportation of dangerous goods directorate within Transport Canada, operates the Canadian Transport Emergency Centre, CANUTEC, to assist emergency response personnel in handling dangerous goods emergencies. This world-renowned centre is staffed by bilingual professional scientists, specialized in emergency response and experienced in interpreting technical information and providing advice to first responders.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704327">The centre operates 24 hours a day and handles some 30,000 phone calls a year related to safety. Delegations from around the world regularly visit CANUTEC to incorporate Canadian practices into their own countries' dangerous goods programs.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704328"> CANUTEC was involved immediately after the incident in Lac-Mégantic, providing first responders involved in the tragic incident with information regarding potential hazards of the dangerous goods, evacuation distance, train consist information, and protective clothing requirements, among others.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704329">First responders regularly communicate the importance and necessity of CANUTEC to help them accomplish their response work and to understand the risks associated with the transportation of dangerous goods. CANUTEC also offers first responders access to immediate dangerous goods information following an incident.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3704330">A rail operator is required by regulation to provide CANUTEC with the train consist immediately following an incident. This train consist provides first responders with detailed information on the specific products the train in question was transporting, beyond the general information provided by the placards on the cars. This is much more detailed information.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704331">It allows CANUTEC specialists to target detailed advice on handling products, which may have spilled and mixed, or recommended initial evacuation zones. It enables them to understand immediately what risks they face when they are involved in an incident.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704332">This existing requirement for immediate information to be provided to first responders through CANUTEC, in combination with the new requirements to provide municipalities with historical information through the protective direction, demonstrates our government's commitment to support first responders with the information they require to respond to a dangerous goods incident.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704333">We are fortunate. Anyone involved in emergency response and the transportation of dangerous goods safety knows the importance of CANUTEC and its emergency response guidebook. This guidebook, produced by Transport Canada, helps first responders, police, fire, ambulance and paramedics, to respond and protect Canadians during the initial phase of a dangerous goods incident.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3704334">The emergency response guidebook is an informative and comprehensive guide designed for use at a dangerous goods incident occurring on a highway, aircraft, ship or railroad. It enables first responders to quickly identify the specific or generic hazards of the material involved in an incident. The guidebook is used by many first responders. It is something that is widely provided.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704335">Could the minister clarify a number of oversight positions for each mode of transportation, and for the transport of dangerous goods? After she has done that, perhaps she could comment on the January 23 Transportation Safety Board-issued recommendations regarding emergency response assistance plans, ERAPs. Perhaps the minister could tell the House what actions our government took to respond to these recommendations.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I gave the incorrect number in the last round of questioning. I just want to make sure that for the purposes of the record, I am clear that in civil aviation the oversight positions numbers are 1137 and not what I said, which was the total number, 1707.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704337">I thank the hon. member for catching me on that one and ensuring that we have the record sorted out, and I am delighted that he talked about a topic that is very important to us.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704338">With regard to what happened in Lac-Mégantic, the first meeting I had was in Lac-Mégantic with the mayor of Lac-Mégantic, and from there I met the local mayors ten days later. The one thing that came out of it was the importance of understanding that first responders needed to have certain information and, second, that they needed to ensure that they had a communication line open with the rail companies in their area.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704339">That is what we have been trying to do through our protective directives, the first one having to do with the information and the second one, which we just did, having to do with emergency preparedness along Canada's railway lines.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3704340">As the member pointed out, an ERAP, or emergency response assistance plan, is a formal plan. It is what industry says it will do to support first responders, the ones first on the scene in the event of an accident involving dangerous goods. Sometimes it requires special expertise and sometimes it requires special response equipment. An ERAP helps municipalities and local emergency responders by providing them with around-the-clock technical expertise and specifically trained and equipped emergency response personnel at the scene of an accident.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704341">The ERAP describes specialized response capabilities and equipment that would be used to support response to incidents involving higher-risk dangerous goods. It addresses emergency preparedness, personnel training, response exercises, and equipment maintenance.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704342">As the hon. member also pointed out, CANUTEC supports first responders as well. Transport Canada's 24-hour emergency centre is staffed with scientists who provide real-time information and emergency responses by the first responders following an accident or an incident, something which the municipalities told us they wanted to have.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3704343">Prior to my announcement on April 23, regulations required an ERAP for certain volatile refined fuels, such as gasoline or diesel, when there were a large number of cars in interconnected trains. The requirement did not apply to crude oil or if a smaller number of cars were transported.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704344">ERAP requirements are now being expanded to include specific flammable liquids transported in large volumes by train. The protective directives that we put in place require shippers to develop these ERAPs for flammable liquids like crude oil, gasoline, diesel, aviation fuel, and ethanol. An ERAP is required even when it is just a single tank. I think that is an important specific issue with respect to how we are dealing with this matter.</ParaText><ParaText id="3704345">Industry must submit the ERAP to Transport Canada for approval within 150 days, and we have set up a task force as well to facilitate even further more recommendations that may be made by the transportation of dangerous goods general policy advisory committee's emergency response working group.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
