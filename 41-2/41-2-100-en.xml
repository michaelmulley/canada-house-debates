              <ParaText id="3781396">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to present a petition that was collected in Prince Edward Island, so it is signed largely by Prince Edward Islanders but also by visitors to our fair province. These are Canadians who are concerned about the cuts to Canada Post. They are concerned about the job losses associated with these cuts, the impact they will have on seniors and the disabled, and the lack of consultation that led to the cuts. They call on the government to reverse the cuts to services announced by Canada Post and look, instead, for ways to innovate in areas such as postal banking.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3781435">This is a $5-billion income-splitting scheme that the Conservatives have proposed that would not help upwards of 85% of Canadians. Let us pause for a moment. It is a $5-billion scheme that 85% of Canadians would see no benefit whatsoever from. That fact is actually increasing with recent reports. We have one report out today from the Broadbent Institute, called “The Big Split”, that says the number of Canadians who will miss out on this particular program might be quite a bit higher.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781436">It is not just from progressive think tanks; it is also from groups like C.D. Howe. It is also from very conservative economists across the country who have come out and said that the proposal as offered by the Conservatives is one that would increase income inequality in this country. It would further push the tax burden onto the middle- and working-class Canadians and away from those who are earning the most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781437">We know that over the last 30 to 35 years income inequality has increased dramatically in Canada. Some 90% or more of that was experienced under Liberal regimes, which is, I suppose, telling of the traditional Liberal way of campaigning, which is to campaign to the left but govern to the right. A massive amount of inequality went on under the Liberals but the Conservatives picked up that bad tradition and have continued it. We see income inequality increasing. A recent Parliamentary Budget Office report showed that of the recent tax breaks that came, those people in the 20% top-earning tax bracket took home $11 billion in benefits, fully 36% of all that was offered. The bottom 20%, those we would think they would be most interested in helping out, took home a little less than $2 billion of what was offered, so less than 6%. The top 20% get more than one-third of the benefit, and the bottom 20% get around 6% of the benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781438"> That is the Conservative ideology. We understand that. We disagree with it fundamentally as New Democrats, and we see increasing disagreement about the Conservative ideology and plans because income inequality hurts the economy broadly. It does not just hurt those who are most impacted and affected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781439">We have also seen a second tax shift that has gone on and it is not just increasing the burden to the middle and lower incomes in Canada. We have also seen a tax shift away from corporations under the Conservatives. Just since the Conservatives' taking power, the corporate tax burden has dropped by almost $4.5 billion while personal income tax has increased by $15 billion. When they ask who is paying for all the services that Canadians rely upon, such as the police and the fire and the health and education services, all of those things, and they wonder who is picking up the tab, they see that under a Conservative world view they do not believe corporations should have any part in that. The Conservatives do not think that corporations derive any benefit, I suppose, so why should they pay for it?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781440"> Yet we know that good transportation systems, good urban transit, good health care and good education support not just those who are directly implicated but help the entire economy more broadly because healthy and smart workers make for a profitable and prosperous economy. Yet the Conservative world view says that corporations should not have to pay for any of that, that individuals should pay more and more, and we see that in the numbers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781441">The Conservatives are entitled to their own opinion on this issue, but they are not entitled to their own facts. The facts speak clearly and loudly that there have been increasing shifts in the burden of taxes away from the rich to the middle class and lower incomes and away from corporations to the individual. Those two shifts have been very destructive to millions of Canadian families and, I would argue, have hindered the Canadian economy writ large.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781442">We wish that the Conservatives would at least take the Hippocratic oath and just promise to please do no harm, because they have made things bad and they now propose to make things worse. They somehow believe that the answer to income inequality is to have more income inequality. The suggestion from the current finance minister is that this type of income-splitting scheme, which is going to cost the treasury upward of $5 billion and only benefit less than 15% of Canadians, and will only benefit the 15% of Canadians who least need the help, is a good plan for Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781443">I will give the Conservatives credit for this. They have somehow managed to unify right- and left-thinking economists in this country. This is a rare feat. This is kind of hard to do, because if we put three economists in a room, we end up with five opinions, but on income splitting the Conservatives have managed to bring all the economists to one side, whether they are progressive or more conservative thinkers. As the C.D. Howe Institute said, this policy does more harm than good. It has also garnered a certain amount of attention from Canada's leading papers. Let me read a couple of quotes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781444">The first one is in the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I>, which states:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3781447">Let us talk about which kinds of families those are. Who would benefit is a relatively short list that one can quickly and easily define. As the Broadbent Institute calls it, it is the <I>Mad Men</I> family. It takes us back to the 1950s, maybe the 1960s, where there was one income earner who was earning quite a bit of money and the spouse earning very little. That is who would benefit from this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781448">Who would not benefit is a long list, and we should go through it. There will probably be a bunch of Conservative ads on this, if history is any teacher, and a lot of Canadians might think that they can see themselves benefiting, maybe it applies to them and will help out their families. This would not help people whose kids are over 18. It would not help people who do not have kids. Imagine that. It would not help people who are not married and with kids under 18. It would not help people who are married with kids under 18, but are in the same income bracket. All of the people I just listed would get no benefit from this scheme whatsoever. When we start to whittle it down to find out who it would actually benefit, more and more we see that it would benefit people who do not actually need it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3781460"> This would put further pressure on women to not enter or re-enter the workforce. Why would the Conservatives want to do that when all we hear from economists, the banks through the progressive side, from the manufacturers association, from basically every key group in the Canadian economy, is that we need more women in the workforce, we need women who have left the workforce to come back in and to have that choice? The Conservatives knowingly would invoke a policy that would resist that and would say no to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781461">We know that women on average earn 16% less than men in Canada. That is a deplorable fact, but that fact should have some bearing on the way the Conservatives design tax policy. If women are earning a significant amount less than their male counterparts on average and they are married and may even possibly benefit and fall into that rare 14% of this category, the pressure would be on them to stay home because they are earning less on average. The Conservatives know this.</ParaText>

I know there are some Conservatives who believe that. This is 2014. This is an idea that most right-thinking people, most progressive people, have long since left behind. The Conservatives say that maybe the only place for a woman is in the home or something. We believe a woman's place is in the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781463">This policy explicitly supports the Conservative world view, which we think is wrong. They are trying to do some social engineering here, through the tax code, and we know that the Conservatives love their boutique tax credits. They like to tell Canadians how to think and shop and what programs to put their kids into and little incentives here. They love to put their hand in the market and put their hand on the scale. They like some free market but not all free market. They like to intervene on mortgage rates and all sorts of things and interfere.

              <ParaText id="3781468">I know the Conservatives feel like they somehow are entitled to their position in government and that the next election, within a year, cannot come too soon. We see this with governments. Governments age very badly, the current government being a great example. The arrogance and entitlement seems to be something that almost inherently is affected in this place. The fact that the Conservatives would go into that election saying that they are going to wed themselves to this particular policy, as bad as it is, as unequal as it is, as ineffective as it is at helping Canadians but simply out of hubris and pride, shows just how far they have fallen away from their roots of responsible and accountable government.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3781469">If the government has some sort of assessment of what this program would do for Canadians, that is much more than the 14% or 15% of Canadian households that would benefit by the income splitting scheme or that it has not been skewed to the most wealthy of Canadians, then I look forward to the debate today. I know my colleagues, the New Democrats, look forward to hearing the evidence as to why this is such a great scheme and why spending $5 billion at the federal and provincial levels is a great idea.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781470">It is remarkable that so many Canadians would be excluded. When Conservatives are on the doorsteps in the next election telling people that they have a plan for them, if they are talking to a person who is not married, then I guess they will have to move on to the next door. If they come to a door where the household has children older than 18 who have moved on, then they have to move on to the next doorstep. If at the next door there is a single parent, and I was raised singly by my mom, that parent will not benefit from this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781471">I would think that if we were to spend this kind of money to try to target and help families, which is what the Conservatives are claiming to do with this policy, then we would try to help those families that are struggling to make ends meet. We would try to help those families that, for more than 30 years, have suffered through growing inequality and that, under the Conservatives, have seen so much less of the benefits. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781472">I have listed the statistics before, but I will do it again. Out of the Conservative tax breaks, the bottom 20% got around 6% of the benefit, and the top 20% got 36% of the benefit. Maybe that is another golf membership or jacuzzi in the backyard for some, but for those families struggling to pay the bills, it is offensive that the Conservative government keeps ignoring the basic needs of families trying to get their kids to school and offer their children better hope.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781473"> For the first time in many generations in our country, all the evidence is pointing to the generation following having a lower quality of life than what we are experiencing right now. If there is any wish parents have for their children, it is that they will have equal or better opportunities than the parent did. However, the opportunity gap grows with the income gap. The gap in opportunity that is afforded to middle-class and working-class Canadians and their children is growing. The gap in accessing better education and training, to that first job, to get that first business loan to start that new enterprise, is growing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781474">As was once said by an American politician, it becomes a society of the haves and the have mores. Under this policy, that is something the government is going to promote. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781475">The government will say that those who already have great resources, who have benefited greatly by living in this society and prospering through their own hard work or through some endowment are going to get more under the Conservatives because they feel they deserve more for just being who they are. However, those in the middle and lower incomes will get less. They will access less and their services will be cut because we know what the Conservative government has been doing. It is lowering expectations, lowering services, reducing health transfers and gutting environmental policies. It is doing all of this in some nefarious scheme to say to Canadians that they should not expect much from government, particularly if one is so unlucky to have been born into the middle or lower classes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781476">One of the concerns that economists are expressing to us is what they call a “stratification” of the economy. Canada, for many generations, has enjoyed the possibility that, regardless of where or at what income level one was born, there was a possibility that one could improve one's lot through hard work and dedication. To take that hope away from people is more than discouraging; it is despicable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781477"> This is something that no government should promote. However, we hear it time and again from across the political spectrum, from economists to the C.D. Howe Institute to the Broadbent Institute to the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives to Conservative economists and left-wing economists. They agree that this program, this $5 billion income splitting scheme will offer benefit to very few people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781478">The New Democrats oppose this proposal because it disproportionately helps those who do not need it and hurts those who need a hand. As New Democrats, there is nothing more fundamental for us, it goes to our DNA, we believe the role of government is the thing that we do when we come together to accomplish that which we cannot accomplish alone.</ParaText>

We have asked the new <Affiliation DbId="204553" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> several times for a copy of that taxpayer funded report, but he will not offer it.

              <ParaText id="3781512">Mr. Speaker, I was interested in hearing how gloomy things were back in the 1960s and 1970s when my colleague was growing up and how bad the family structure was back then. However, he spent most of his time pointing out all of the Canadians who would not benefit from this tax proposal. I wonder if my colleague would point out how many Canadians did not benefit from the investment of taxpayer dollars into the satellite offices that my colleague and his friends set up. How many Canadians did not benefit from those mailings that went out in franked envelopes paid for by the taxpayers, which had NDP partisan material inserted in them? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781513">It is important to realize that those tax dollars could have easily helped to reduce the tax burden on Canadians across Canada, including those who are trying to raise children under 18, who this policy would definitely benefit. It would help them with clothing allowances, education, sports and the things that all of us in the House think are important for young families to give to their children.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3781521">I am pleased to respond to the extremely misguided motion proposed by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170843" Type="2">Skeena—Bulkley Valley</Affiliation> in regard to income equality. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781522">In his earlier comments, it seemed that he was putting women in the kitchen. I am proud to say that I am a woman. I am a member of the House of Commons. I am a chartered accountant, and I am a mother. I am proud of all of these roles. Apparently, the hon. member is not comfortable with that kind of diversity in our caucuses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781523">Today I would like to reassure the hon. member that our government's top priority remains focused on creating jobs, economic growth, and long-term prosperity for future generations, for our children. At the same time, we are ensuring that all Canadians have the opportunity to share in the benefits of a strong economy. That is progressive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781524">I would like to highlight what our government's economic action plan has done to reduce taxes for Canadian families like members' families and mine, since taking office in 2006.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781525">I am not surprised that the NDP is against a tax cut to put money in the pockets of Canadians. Everyone in the House is well aware of that party's record for opposing tax relief for Canadians. This attitude is precisely why the NDP, in all of its socialist wisdom, knows how to spend money better than those who earn it. We disagree.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781526">I would like to talk about our government's strong record of tax relief for Canadians, both low income and middle income. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781527">Since we have formed government, Canadians have benefited from significant broad-based tax cuts. These tax reductions have given individuals and families more flexibility to make the choices that are right for them. The average Canadian family of four will pay close to $3,400 less in taxes, this year and every year to come. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781528">These significant savings come from a variety of sources, such as a reduction in the GST rate to 5% from 7%, a tax cut that the Parliamentary Budget Officer noted is progressive and that significantly helps lower-income families. Of course, the opposition voted against this significant relief for low-income Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781529">We also increased the amount that all Canadians can earn without paying federal tax, a measure that has helped low and middle-income Canadians across the spectrum. Again, it was opposed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781530">We took 380,000 Canadian seniors off the tax roll completely because they no longer have to pay federal taxes. I am sorry to say that, at least in my province, they still pay significant provincial tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781531">Our government introduced the working income tax benefit to help low-income Canadians over the welfare wall. Yet again, this was opposed by the opposition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781532">We have also introduced the universal child care benefit, which is helping young families across the spectrum. Again, it was opposed, with the Liberals famously saying that all it would do is to allow families to buy more beer and popcorn. That is not what families do in my riding. They invest in their children and their children's future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781533">It boggles the mind just how ideologically opposed the opposition is to allowing Canadian families to have more money and to make the decisions that are right for them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781534">However, that is just the beginning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781535">Our Conservative government has also introduced numerous targeted tax reduction measures. For example, we have helped families by introducing the children's fitness tax credit and the children's arts tax credit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781536">We have introduced the registered disability savings plan to help individuals with severe disabilities and their families save for their children's long-term financial security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781537">We have enhanced support to caregivers of infirm, dependent family members by introducing the family caregiver tax credit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781538">We have provided annual targeted tax relief for seniors and pensioners by increasing the age credit and the pension income credit amounts.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="50">(1050)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3781539">We have provided further support to students, especially to their families, because a lot of families help their children to get through university. We have now exempted scholarship income from taxation. That was a big change. We have introduced a textbook tax credit, and we are making registered education savings plans more responsive to changing needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781540">We have introduced pension income splitting for seniors, which has had a huge and helpful impact on so many seniors, and we have introduced the public transit tax credit, to encourage public transit use and again put more money in the pockets of the people who use it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781541">We have introduced the tax-free savings account, the most significant change to taxation since the introduction of RRSPs, in 1957. In total, our government will have provided almost $160 billion in tax relief for Canadian families and individuals over the last six-year period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781542">Let me point out to the opposition that Canadians, at all income levels, are benefiting from tax relief introduced by our government, with low-income and middle-income Canadians receiving proportionately greater relief than higher-income Canadians. In fact, the federal tax burden is the lowest that it has been for all Canadians in 50 years. More than one million low-income Canadians have been completely removed from the tax rolls as a result of the tax relief provided by our government. That leads to real income equality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781543">Canadian families, in all major income groups, have seen increases of about 10% or more in their real after-tax, after-transfer income, since we, the Conservative Party of Canada, have formed government. Canadian families in the lowest income group have seen a 14% increase in real income.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781544"> Moreover, Canadian families in all major income groups had higher income, after taxes, transfers, and inflation, in 2011, than they had prior to the recession. That is great news for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781545">The share of Canadians living in low-income families has also fallen to its lowest level in three decades. Canadian children from poor families have a higher probability of moving up the income scale than similar children in such countries as the United States, the United Kingdom, France, or Sweden. This confirms that our low-tax plan for job creation, economic growth, and long-term prosperity is in fact working.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781546">Going forward, the government will keep taxes low and will examine ways to provide further tax relief for Canadians, while returning to balanced budgets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781547"> Of course, the leader of the NDP claims that the average Canadian family earns 7% less than they did 35 years ago. This figure is wrong and is based on median market income of Canadians before tax, before transfer income. This is not new math; this is bad math. We have to take all of the factors into account when we do any kind of calculation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781548">This figure does not adjust for the fact that the average number of people in Canadian families has actually declined over the last three decades, and overlooks the impact of taxes and transfers. Controlling for the changing composition of Canadian families and accounting for the impact of taxes and transfers, the income of middle-income families has increased by 31%, since 1976.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781549">Our government has shown that we are providing the support that hard-working Canadian families need. Our recent budgets have built upon our record of supporting families and communities while establishing a path for returning to balanced budgets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781550">Economic action plan 2014 supports families by keeping taxes low; better recognizing the costs of adopting a child; helping to lower the prices of consumer goods; better protecting financial consumers, including seniors; and promoting low-cost and secure pension options.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781551">Our approach is working. I am very optimistic about our prospects as a nation, and I am very optimistic about the opportunities that will be available because of economic action plan 2014, for our children, for the future, for our seniors, and for Canadian families, who now have more money in their pockets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781552">Conservatives believe that Canadian families know how to spend their money. They do not need the NDP to spend it for them.</ParaText>

I want to congratulate her for bringing together the bigger picture that this government is attempting to do, which is to create a very efficient way of running the country, keeping health care transfers at the highest level ever, social transfers to the provinces, but also reducing taxes in every area we can think of.

              <ParaText id="3781572">I would like to take my time today to describe how our government's economic policies have strengthened Canada's middle class. We all know that a strong middle class is vital for Canada's economy. However, while the NDP and Liberals claim to advocate on behalf of the middle class, it is our government that is delivering results. Consider the following: a recent Statistics Canada study revealed that since this government has taken office, the middle class has flourished significantly, and I quote: </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3781576">These statistics are remarkable in their own right, but they are even more impressive when we consider the global economic challenges Canada has navigated during this period. Indeed, we experienced the worst global recession since the Second World War, yet our economic performance during both the recession and the recovery is among the strongest in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781577">Over one million net new jobs have been added since the height of the recession, the vast majority of which are full-time and in the private sector. This is one of the strongest job creation records in the G7.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781578">At a time when Canada's financial systems were brought to the brink of bankruptcy, Canada's banks remained the soundest in the world. When other countries increased taxes, our government kept taxes at record lows. In fact, the federal tax burden is at its lowest level in 50 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781579">Unlike the opposition, we believe that leaving more money in the pockets of hard-working Canadian families is a good thing. That extra money provides flexibility to make the choices that are best for them. It also helps build a solid foundation for future economic growth, more jobs, and living standards for all Canadians. That is why our Conservative government has proudly introduced close to 180 tax relief measures since taking office, reducing taxes in every way the government collects them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781580">What is more, Canadians at all income levels are benefiting from tax relief, with low- and middle-income Canadians receiving proportionately greater relief, as the Parliamentary Budget Officer recently confirmed. Indeed, Canadian families in all income groups have seen increases of about 10% or more in their take-home pay since 2006. In 2014, the average Canadian family is saving close to $3,400 in taxes, while one million low-income Canadians have been removed from the tax rolls altogether. This is historic tax relief.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781581">Unfortunately, the tax-and-spend opposition continues to oppose each and every one of our tax cuts. Let me take this opportunity to remind it of some of the tax reductions it voted against: cutting the lowest personal income tax rate to 15%; increasing the amount Canadians can earn tax free; reducing the GST from 7% to 5%, putting more than $1,000 back in the pockets of an average family of four in 2014; and establishing the landmark tax-free savings account, the most significant advance in the tax treatment of personal savings since the RRSP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781582">In addition, the opposition has opposed a variety of tax credits that recognize the costs borne by hard-working Canadian families, credits like the child tax credit, the children's fitness tax credit, the children's arts tax credit, the family caregiver tax credit, and the first-time home buyers' tax credit. They were against other target measures to help Canadian families, including the home buyers' plan, the adoption expense tax credit, and the medical expense tax credit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781583">We have also enhanced benefits for families and individuals, which the opposition also voted against. These include the universal child care benefit, which offers families more choice in child care by providing up to $1,200 a year for each child under age six, and the working income tax benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781584">More recently, in economic action plan 2014, our government proposed a number of measures to expand tax relief for health care services. These included exempting the professional services of acupuncturists and naturopathic doctors from the GST and HST.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781585">To support people with disabilities, our government introduced the registered disability savings plan, or RDSP, in budget 2007. The RDSP is widely regarded as a major policy innovation and positive development in helping to ensure the long-term financial security of those with severe disabilities. Since becoming available in 2008, over 81,000 RDSPs have been opened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781586">These important measures are a handful of examples illustrating how our government has responded to the needs of Canadian families and has helped Canadians keep more of their hard-earned money.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="05">(1105)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3781587">However, as we frequently see, the opposition members reject our efforts to lower taxes for Canadians. They prefer that we adopt dangerous economic policies such as a carbon tax that could kill businesses, investment, and jobs and hurt Canadian families to further their own misguided agenda. We will not engage in reckless spending that would inevitably be paid for by middle-class families. Unlike the opposition, we believe in spending taxpayer dollars efficiently, effectively, and only when necessary. After all, Canadian families know the importance of living within their means, and they expect governments to do the same. That leads me to my final point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781588"> Perhaps one of the most profound ways we are helping Canadians is by making sure that future generations will not be paying for past obligations of their parents and grandparents by returning to balanced budgets in 2015. By returning to surplus, we would ensure solid, stable prosperity for all Canadians well into the future. Indeed, balancing the budget and reducing debt would ensure that taxpayer dollars would be used to support important social services such as health care rather than for paying interest costs. It would preserve Canada's low-tax plan and allow for further tax reductions, fostering growth and the creation of jobs for the benefit of all Canadians. It would also strengthen the country's ability to respond to longer-term challenges, such as population aging and unexpected global economic shocks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781589">This government understands the importance of middle-class Canadians, and as our actions have shown, we have listened and we have ensured a middle class for this country that will continue to lead the world. We will continue with our low-tax plan, unlike the tax-and-spend Liberals and New Democrats, whose high-tax, high-spending agenda would threaten jobs and set working families back.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3781603">This is a two-part motion. The first part is a statement that acknowledges the harmful effect of the increase in inequality on Canadian society and tries to assign blame solely to the Conservative and Liberal governments. The second part is a condemnation of the Conservatives' election promise on income splitting.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3781604">I would like to address these two parts in order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781605">First, in terms of income inequality, I agree with my colleagues in the NDP that rising income inequality is a crucial issue for Canadian families. I also agree that it is harmful to our society and that as members of Parliament, we ought to address it. That is why two years ago, I moved a private member's motion directing the House of Commons finance committee to conduct an in-depth study of income inequality. In the wording of that motion and in my speeches in this place I avoided partisanship and as such obtained support from members of Parliament from all political parties, including sufficient support from Conservative members to actually pass that motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781606">The purpose of that study was to identify solutions and to put Parliament on a path of progress toward greater equality of opportunity in Canada. At the time, I asked that all members of the House put partisanship aside and work together on this issue, and we were successful in having the finance committee conduct a study. In the end, the finance committee spent just a small fraction of its time on income inequality compared to its other studies. Despite that, the committee's report to the House identified a number of credible solutions that would improve equality of opportunity for Canadians across the country. It included solutions such as increasing the availability of affordable early child education and care programs, a recommendation that was supported by a variety of witnesses, including the Canadian Medical Association, Canada 2020, TD Economics, and the Canadian Council on Social Development. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3781607">The report also showed the extent of the problem. It showed that income inequality and equality of opportunity have worsened in Canada over the last generation. The fact is that they have deteriorated under the federal and provincial governments of all parties.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3781608">Let us be clear that federal and provincial governments have a shared responsibility for social investment and tax policy and have a responsibility to create conditions for social equity and economic growth and opportunity. This shared responsibility includes all governments, federally and provincially, including NDP governments, although the motion specifically chooses to say “Liberal and Conservative governments” without acknowledging that in fact this is not a partisan issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781609">If we are going to deal with this issue effectively, we need to accept that income inequality has grown in Canada, just as it has grown in most of the industrialized world. There are a number of reasons, but some countries are doing a better job than others in maintaining equality of income and equality of opportunity, and those best practices and ideas are what we should be looking at. If we look at Canada's record of rising income inequality, we see that our colleagues in the NDP have taken a selective view of the facts. I encourage them to avoid this temptation, because if we look at the evidence available to us, we get a different perspective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781610">We can look at Canada's provincial Gini coefficients. StatsCan tracks the annual Gini coefficients for every province back to 1976. Members of the House will already know that the Gini coefficient is the most common way to measure income inequality, with zero representing a completely equal society in which everyone receives the same income and one representing a society in which all the income would go to one person or family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781611">When the New Democrats look at these Gini coefficients, they want to focus on total after-tax income. This measurement looks at the inequality that remains after governments have redistributed income through taxes and transfers. The drafters of today's motion and anyone else who wants to follow along at home can find provincial Gini coefficients for total after-tax income on the StatsCan website in CANSIM Table 202-07051.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781612">The data show us that when the NDP was most recently in government in B.C., from 1991 to 2001, income inequality among B.C. families went up by more than 15%. That is a drastic increase, to borrow a phrase from today's motion. That is after taxes and transfers are factored in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781613">For individuals living in B.C., the Gini coefficient went up by more than 12%. That is a drastic increase. Ten years of NDP rule left B.C. with the highest rate of income inequality of any province in Canada. That is despite the fact that the NDP inherited the fourth-lowest rate of income inequality when it took office in B.C. Today B.C.'s Gini coefficient sits slightly lower than it did when the NDP left office. Thankfully, I guess, if we were in the blaming business, which I do not think we ought to be, the current Liberal government has been able to undo some of that damage when it comes to income inequality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781614">The NDP record on income inequality is not much better in Saskatchewan. After 16 years of NDP rule, the Gini coefficient for Saskatchewan households climbed by more than 8%, which is another drastic increase. Even in Manitoba, the most recent data show that income inequality for households is up by 2.5% since the NDP have taken office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781615">I am only using these examples to point out that the NDP ought not try to make this a partisan issue, because by doing so we distract this House from dealing with the issue itself. The NDP has intentionally tried to prevent a consensus in this House on the issue of income inequality by playing politics and partisanship with us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781616">The Conservatives would say that income inequality is not an issue. They are wrong. The NDP will try to make it an issue of class warfare and try to divide it along party lines. I think that is also wrong if we are serious about the issue. The issues of rising income inequality and inequality of opportunity are too important and the consequences of inaction too dire for us to be engaged purely in partisan bickering. Canadians will be better off if we work together to understand how we can reduce income inequality and strengthen equality of opportunity. Therefore, I encourage all members of this House to accept the record of their respective parties and let us focus on the future and develop the best public policy responses to this important issue. We need to move on together and work on solutions that can strengthen equality of opportunity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781617">We also need to address what is probably the worst example of inequality in our country, aboriginal and first nations Canadians. There is a demographic, social, and economic time bomb represented by, among other things, the fact that 400,000 young aboriginal and first nations members will be entering the workforce in the next 10 years. If they have the skills they need to compete and succeed, it would be a good thing for our economy. If they do not, which is the case with many, it will be of dire consequences to our economy and our society. We need to close the first nations and aboriginal non-first nations education system funding gap. That is something we ought to all agree on across party lines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781618">These are important issues, and the cost of inaction is significantly high. We have heard from the Conference Board of Canada and from the former dean of the Rotman School of Management, Roger Martin. We have heard from the former governor of the Bank of Canada, now Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney. All have said that those who say income inequality is not an issue are wrong and that those who want to make it an issue of class warfare are wrong. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781619">We have to focus on equality of opportunity. They have all warned us that rising income inequality and inequality of opportunity will limit economic growth and prosperity and that rising inequality will tear at our social fabric. It causes future generations to lose hope, and it is notable that for the first time a majority of Canadians now believe that today's generation will be worse off than their parents. Rising inequality weakens the public trust in our institutions. As parliamentarians, we must be careful and avoid policies that would lessen equality of opportunity or deepen inequality.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3781620">Inequality can rise when governments lose sight of how their policies affect equality of opportunity. For example, the proliferation of non-refundable tax credits is contributing to greater inequality. These tax credits exclude low-income Canadians from any benefit. Another example of a measure that will increase income inequality is the Conservatives' income-splitting scheme, which is, of course, the subject of the second part of today's motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781621">In the last general election, the Conservatives vowed to bring in income splitting as soon as the budget was balanced. It was a cornerstone of their 2011 election platform. Some estimate its cost at $3 billion per year, and I have heard potentially $5 billion. It is clearly the Conservatives' biggest election promise so far.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781622">During the election, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said that once the budget is balanced, income splitting “...should be one of our highest priorities”. According to the fine print, couples with children under 18 would be allowed to split up to $50,000 of income each year for tax purposes. However, since the election, both the C.D. Howe Institute and the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives have published thorough reports showing massive flaws in the Conservatives' plan. They have shown how the Conservatives' promise to bring in income splitting would disproportionately benefit high-income earners at the expense of the middle class and low-income earners. The C.D. Howe Institute has called the Conservatives' income splitting a flawed idea that excludes 85% of Canadian households from any benefit whatsoever. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781623">However, it is not that these low- and middle-income Canadians would be just completely left out of the deal; worse than that, they would end up having to pick up the tab through reductions in social investments that could benefit them, and ultimately they would pay higher taxes in other ways. In the words of the C.D. Howe Institute report, the Conservatives' promise:</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781625">In other words, most Canadians will pay for this expensive Conservative tax cut through higher taxes or reduced services or both. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781626">Let us look at some examples of how a family might or might not benefit under the Conservative scheme.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781627">In the Conservatives' budget, they like to give examples of how a family might be impacted by their plan. They even give these family members names. In fact, if we flip to page 190 of the latest budget, we will see that Blake earns $48,000 and Laurie earns $72,000. Blake and Laurie and their two children represent the Conservatives' idea of an average middle-class family. In fact, they are on the higher end of the average, and the Conservative's claim about their savings from previous budgets are a bit skewed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781628">However, even in the Conservatives' idyllic vision of the middle-class family, Blake and Laurie would not get a penny from the Conservatives' expensive promise to bring in income splitting. Even the fictitious family that the Conservatives cite in their budget would not benefit from income splitting. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781629">If Blake and Laurie would not get anything under the Conservatives' scheme, and the scheme costs $3 billion per year or more, then who would benefit?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781630">Well, under this scheme, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who earns $320,000 per year and has a stay-at-home spouse, would actually save $6,500 per year. Meanwhile, a Canadian who has a stay-at-home spouse and who earns the average industrial wage would save less than $10 per week. Most households would get absolutely nothing, including households run by a single parent, a person who is struggling to make ends meet, who has no one else to rely on, and who cannot access good-quality child care and early learning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781631">Former finance minister Jim Flaherty understood the shortcomings of this plan when he said in February that income splitting needed a long, hard analytical look to see who it affects and to what degree, because he was not sure that overall it would benefit our society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781632">Shortly after Mr. Flaherty made this statement, <I>The Globe and Mail</I> agreed. It published an editorial against the idea, saying:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3781635"> With their income splitting scheme, the Conservatives made a major campaign promise that just was not thought through at the time. Today, with the resources of government and the Department of Finance, the whole government approach, and the capacity of government to research the best practice approaches from around the world and develop sound policy, there is no excuse for the Conservatives not to step back from this and develop a better way to reform our tax system to render it more progressive. We are not in the heat of an election right now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781636">We have not had a significant study of our personal tax system since 1971 with the Carter commission. Everything has changed in the decades that have ensued in terms of both the global economy and the Canadian economy. Surely there is room for a thorough study of our tax system so as to create a tax system that is fairer, more progressive, and potentially even more globally competitive. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781637">We can look at some examples. Germany has a robust economy, but at the same time, it does not have the same levels of income inequality that we have seen grow in Canada. What is it doing in terms of apprenticeship? What is it doing in terms of skilled trades? What is it doing in its tax system that we could learn from?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781638">The Nordic countries are other examples. Scandinavian countries are sound economic models. They have good growth, and even competitive corporate tax rates in many cases. They also make good investments in progressive social policy, like early learning and child care, as examples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781639">The Liberal Party is open to supporting tax changes that would benefit middle income Canadians. We introduced the working income tax benefit in the last mini-budget in the autumn of 2005 when the member for <Affiliation DbId="170466" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation> was finance minister. That was an example of progressive social policy that helps people get over the welfare wall.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781640">The child tax benefit was introduced by a Liberal government but continued and expanded under the Conservative government. It is another example of a progressive tax policy that has benefited a lot of Canadian families. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781641">Compare those with the non-refundable tax credits that I mentioned earlier that do not benefit low income Canadians and do not change people's behaviour. If high income earners have children in hockey, they are going to benefit, but even if they do not receive it, their children would still be in hockey.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781642">We ought to be thinking about the low income families for whom a direct benefit might make the difference toward their children being in an activity that could change their lives and improve not just their childhood but put them on track to a productive and healthy life. These are the people we ought to be most concerned about, because they are falling through the cracks, and that comes at a huge social and economic cost, not just to those families but to all of us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781643">We cannot support an income splitting scheme that would help high income earners and shift the burden to the already struggling middle class and low income families who are having trouble making ends meet. We cannot support a tax cut that would so clearly lead to greater income inequality and inequality of opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781644">This brings me to the motion before the House today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781645">We agree that increasing income inequality and a growing inequality of opportunity is harmful to Canadian society. We agree that the Conservatives' income splitting scheme excludes the vast majority of Canadians from any benefit whatsoever and that it could lead to greater income inequality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781646">Finally, the fact is that Canada has seen a drastic increase in income inequality under federal and provincial governments of all stripes. This debate ought not be simply about assigning blame but instead be about recognizing the problem and working together across party lines to find solutions. Therefore, the Liberal Party supports the motion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3781648">I understand that there are, perhaps, some hurt feelings, because the motion, as it reads, talks about how recent Liberal and Conservative governments have increased income inequality in Canada. My friend from the Liberal Party wants to debate whether that is a partisan attack or a statement of fact. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781649">The statement of fact is that income inequality has increased dramatically under successive Liberal and Conservative governments. The member then went on in his speech to say that it was more the fault of the provinces, when the Liberals were in power, I suppose. It was not at all connected, in the Liberals' view, to the fact that the Liberal federal government cut transfer payments by as much as 40% to those same provinces. Maybe there is a connection. We argue that there is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781650">I am very glad that the member was declarative about the Liberals' support for the NDP motion to say that the $5-billion price tag to this income splitting scheme would be unfair.

I really wish that the New Democrats would actually focus on the issue at hand, which is dealing with income inequality and creating public policy to do that. This motion could have been amended to add “and NDP governments” and it would have been perfectly legitimate, but the question is how productive that is when we ought to be seeking consensus across party lines on this and dealing with the issues that are important. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781653">The member took a swipe at the Conservatives. The Conservatives have not been definitive here today, but I know there were more than 20 Conservatives who voted for my motion to study income inequality at committee. I know that many members of the Conservative Party have a sense that there is a growing inequality of opportunity, that it is wrong, and that we need to do something about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781654">In the wording of motions and in our conduct in the House, we should try to appeal to people's better angels from time to time, as opposed to driving divisive wedges between the parties, and actually work together to develop solutions.

If we frame it as such, we can gain better consensus and build better public policy that respects all parties but, more importantly, deals with an important issue facing Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3781655">Mr. Speaker, the Conservative Party believes in family tax fairness and choice for parents. That is why we brought in the universal child care benefit. Instead of giving money to bureaucrats, researchers, and activists who failed to create day care spaces for years, we give it directly to parents so that they can choose what kind of child care we want. That is the fundamental debate we have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781656">On the question of income splitting, more popularly known as family tax fairness, I support it. I believe it is fair that a single-income family earning $60,000 should pay roughly the same taxes as a dual-income family earning $60,000. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781657">We know from the public opinion data that, overwhelmingly, parents favour the option, if they have a choice, of having one parent in the home in the very early years.

We want to make that a possibility for all of those families who would choose it, regardless of their income.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3781660">The minister referred to early learning and child care. I remember being in the House when he used to call it a national babysitting program. The reality is that early learning and child care are important social investments that create more competitive economies in places like the Nordic countries, for example. He may dismiss these wild-eyed activists, like Margie McCain or Dr. Fraser Mustard, but the reality is that the quantifiable data demonstrates that investments in early learning and child care not only create more social equity but create a more competitive economy.</ParaText>

If there is not a strong middle class with purchasing power, then that slows economic growth. That is the importance of reducing income inequality for the economy. However, it is also important for our democracy, because if income inequality grows, people become very skeptical about whether their government has their best interests at stake. Therefore, there is a double whammy when there is increasing inequality. One is on the economic front and the other on the democratic front. </ParaText>

We see disfranchisement today with a lot of young people, and the fact that only 22% of first-time eligible voters actually vote may be related to the economic challenges young people face today.

I think the government is currently trying to rebrand this measure and find a different name for it. We heard the minister of state talk about justice or fairness for families. On the contrary, this measure is unfair to families. If we look beyond the issue of whether up to $50,000 can be transferred, we see that this measure mostly benefits people with high incomes. A number of studies—the most notable of which are those conducted by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives and the C.D. Howe Institute—clearly showed that 85% to 86% of families will not benefit at all from this measure. It will benefit only 14% or 15% of Canadian families. How is that fair? It is not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781680">Clearly, this is an extremely costly measure for the federal government. It will be extremely costly in terms of the public services that will eventually be lost. The government is responsible for providing adequate funding, but the Conservatives have exactly the opposite philosophy in how they govern.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781681">According to the two organizations' estimates, the measure will cost the various levels of government about $5 billion—$3 billion for the federal government and about $2 billion for the provincial governments. However these measures will benefit less than 15% of Canadians. Why are only 15% of Canadians benefiting? Let us look at those who will not benefit from this measure. I have a whole list. Clearly, income splitting will not do anything for single people because it affects families with children. It will not do anything for couples who do not have any children. It will not do anything for single-parent families, even though they could use a break, because the measure pertains to couples. Clearly, if a person does not have a spouse, income cannot be transferred. This measure will not do anything for families with children over the age of majority, even if those children are still dependants because they are going to school or they have a disability, for example. The taxation system provides for some tax credits in that regard, but the income splitting measure will not do anything for those individuals. Income splitting will not do anything for families where the parents have similar incomes. A family where both spouses are working and earning about $30,000 will not benefit from this measure at all. This measure does not do anything for parents who earn less than about $42,000 because they are in the lowest tax bracket. We can therefore see that the list of couples who will benefit from this measure is extremely small.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781682">As a blatant example of inequity, consider the members of this House who have minor children and whose spouses or common-law partners are stay-at-home parents. We are people who would benefit from that. Here in the House, there are a number of members who are still young enough to have minor children. With our salary and a stay-at-home partner, if we can transfer up to a maximum of $50,000, we would personally benefit from about $5,000 in tax cuts. Do we want the $5,000? In society, that might benefit us personally. However, ultimately, we need the money far less than couples who, for instance, have trouble making ends meet and where each person has a salary of $20,000 or $25,000. Both must work to provide for their family. We therefore must think of the example we have here in this House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781683">In terms of the list of exceptions, I will move on to the question of good governance. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3781684">As I mentioned, income splitting would increase income inequality, since the wealthiest families would be the ones benefiting from it, as only one spouse needs to work and earns a salary that is high enough to provide for the family. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781685">We are also wondering whether, after balancing the budget, the Conservatives are prepared to do without $3 billion in revenue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781686">The Conservative government often talks about the late Jim Flaherty, former finance minister. However, before he died, Mr. Flaherty had given the Conservative government a serious warning that this measure was extremely risky and that it had to be studied because it would only benefit a few segments of society, leaving out many families who would have far greater need of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781687">In our view, this measure is completely inappropriate. At the time, Mr. Flaherty had warned the government that this measure was risky because, if the government wanted to balance its budget eventually, it had to make choices. Does the government want to throw the country back into deficit right away by providing additional tax cuts once it balances the budget, or does it want to use the surplus for other things such as debt reduction?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781688">Since the Conservatives took power—so since the 2005 public accounts were released—Canada's debt has increased from $421 billion to $667 billion. That figure will be even higher this year. That is an increase of $256 billion—or over 60%—since the Conservatives took power. Do the Conservatives want to use the future surplus to pay down the debt? No, they are talking about offering tax cuts, which will create an even bigger deficit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781689">That is what happened when they lowered the GST from 7% to 5% and we saw our revenues drop by $8 billion a year. In 2008, even before the recession, the Conservatives had started running a deficit as a result of this measure and the additional corporate tax cuts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781690">The Conservatives brag about being good managers, but at the end of the day, they are the ones who put us in a deficit situation. Aside from the period between 2006 and 2008, when they came to power and eliminated the federal government's fiscal space, the last time a Conservative government introduced a balanced budget was in 1912—yet they brag about being good managers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781691">My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170626" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation> mentioned the provinces and income inequality, but he ignored the fact that transfers to the provinces were cut by 40%. These cuts obviously made things tough for the provinces. He blames the provinces for the increase in income inequality. He also blames Liberal, Conservative and New Democrat governments for a situation they inherited from the federal Liberal government at the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781692">The NDP has a better record on balancing budgets than provincial and federal Conservative governments. The governments of Tommy Douglas, Gary Doer and Roy Romanow introduced balanced budgets for over 10 to 15 years, and meanwhile, the federal government was running deficits under the Liberals and Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781693">The NDP is, without a doubt, the party that is most likely to properly manage public finances for the public good and is considered as the party that properly manages taxpayers' money. After assessing the situation, the Department of Finance agrees with us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781694"> The United States has income splitting, and I am certain a Conservative member will point this out. In fact, it is not so much that the U.S. has adopted income splitting, but rather that it has adopted a basic unit of taxation. Unlike Canada, where the individual is the basic unit of taxation, the family is the basic unit of taxation in the U.S. There are historical reasons for that approach. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781695"> In the mid-20th century, the United States needed to unify its taxation policies. A number of states considered the individual as the basic unit of taxation, while others considered it to be the family. Eventually, they had to simplify matters. A broad debate on taxation was held, and the outcome was a more or less simplified taxation system.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="55">(1155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3781696"> The process involved defining the basic unit of taxation. The U.S. decided that it should be the family. A number of commissions, including the Carter commission, and several committees studied the issue. The Carter commission was the last great commission to undertake a reform of the taxation system. After two years criss-crossing the country, the commission produced a report, which was greatly watered down by the subsequent Liberal government, this being the 1970s after all, but widely hailed by academics and tax experts. The report recommended that the individual be considered as the basic unit of taxation. This provision allows for a simpler tax system that everyone can agree on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781697"> Now the government wants to allow people to use the family as the basic unit of taxation in some cases and the individual in others. This will further complicate the taxation system, and if only for that reason, this is not a desirable policy option. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781698"> The government boasts of having already introduced pension income splitting. The tax cost of this initiative is already higher that originally forecast. At the end of the day, as a result of pension income splitting, Canada will lose $1.2 billion in tax revenues while the provinces overall stand to lose about $500 million. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781699"> This example gives us a pretty good idea of what income inequality would look like. Let us consider for a moment how this measure affects seniors. If we divide pensioners into two groups, one-half having the lowest incomes and the other half having the highest, we see that the half with the lowest incomes benefited from only 2% of the tax cuts as a result of pension income splitting. That means that the half with the highest incomes benefited from 98% of the tax cuts. What is more, the 10% of pensioners with the highest incomes benefited from 31% of the tax cuts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781700"> The example of pension income splitting illustrates the scope of the problem and how the income gap will widen, not only as a result of this measure, but also as a result of the Conservatives’ proposed initiative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781701"> Now then, will the government move forward with this initiative? It will be included in the next election platform. However, if we are to believe the current <Affiliation DbId="204553" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and certain MPs, it is clear the government appears intent on moving forward. Moreover, instead of addressing additional income inequality issues, it is starting to rebrand to economists, journalists, the media and society as a whole the totally unfair policy of income splitting, which has now acquired a bad reputation. It will rebrand it as an exceedingly fair policy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781702"> I am truly flabbergasted to see how blind this government is to such clear facts and figures. I am far less hopeful than my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170626" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation>, who spoke just before me, as to the will of the parties in the House to find some common ground for dealing with income inequality. It is clear that the Conservatives are turning a blind eye to this reality. For them, it is a matter of facilitating access to education and training. We are not opposed to that, but it will not be a cure-all. Initiatives have been taken in the past, and continue to be taken by this Conservative government and by various provincial governments, that increase the effects of income inequality. Some of the proposed initiatives, such as income splitting, will increase the problems, even exponentially.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781703"> When I talk about economists, it is quite interesting to see where these negative comments about income splitting are coming from. It is rare to see the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives and the C.D. Howe Institute agree, not only on the fact that this policy is harmful but also on the fact that it would have some financial ramifications. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3781704"> I have a question for my colleagues who always boast of their sound management. Do they really want to take action that will once again put the federal government in a deficit situation, for the sole reason of bringing in a tax break that will benefit only 15% of Canadian households? Would they not rather show good governance and start tackling urgent issues?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781705"> We do not have any problem whatsoever with tax cuts for middle-class families, for families that need a break. However, such measures must be reconciled with measures to reduce the debt, which, may I remind you, has ballooned by 60% since the Conservative government was elected in 2006. Steps will also have to be taken after that to rebuild public services that have been devastated in recent years, especially since 2006.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781706"> Consider R and D, the environment and immigration, to name a few areas. All of these services to Canadians have been drastically cut, jeopardizing in the process services for which Canadians pay taxes and to which ultimately they are entitled. I suspect that one of strategies of the Conservative government, and of Conservatives in general, is to ensure a mismatch between the taxes paid to different levels of government and the services that Canadians receive for their tax dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781707"> I know that a debate on immigration took place in the House until very late last night. I was astounded by a statistic I learned of during the 2013 holidays—if I am not mistaken— regarding a call centre in Montreal that was set up to respond to Canadians requiring a visa or experiencing immigration problems. The number of employees at the call centre was so drastically cut that 91% of telephone calls in December 2013 were lost in the system and never got through to an agent. In other words, only 9% of calls were answered by an agent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781708"> How about we talk about the cuts to science made by the Conservative government? I know what the ramifications of these cuts are because there are a lot of scientists in my riding. Some scientists work at the Maurice-Lamontagne Institute. Others work at the Institut des sciences de la mer, ISMER, at UQAR. Still others work in a number of private sector companies that come under the umbrella of the Technopole maritime du Québec. A hub of expertise has sprung up in Rimouski and the lower Saint Lawrence valley in marine biotechnologies and maritime technologies in general. The cuts made by the government to the Maurice-Lamontagne Institute have resulted in an exodus of scientists from the region. This has hurt not only the region's economy, but also Canada’s reputation in the sciences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781709"> Additionally, there were a number of measures imposed as part of the overhaul of the employment insurance system that are having a major impact on regions where the economy still relies heavily on seasonal employment. These measures are intended to diversify the economy, but that takes time. In reality, the measures imposed by the Conservative government are making the regions in question poorer. Ironically, the Conservatives’ slogan in 2011, at least in Quebec, was “Our regions in power”. Almost every measure imposed by the Conservative government has ended up hurting the regions and making them poorer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781710"> I know that this issue will be a core plank of our election platform in 2015 in the lead-up to the next election. If what we are seeking is good governance, every measure to do with budget surpluses should be divided between logical tax cuts that benefit a broad cross-section of society rather than simply 15% of people, as income splitting would do, paying down the debt and reinvesting in a number of public services that have suffered considerably as a result of this Conservative government’s cutbacks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781711"> This, therefore, is the principle of good governance that we espouse, and it corresponds to the good governance models of our New Democratic governments in the provinces. I hope that the government will listen to reason and scrap this ill-advised policy of income splitting in favour of adopting fiscal and economic policies that will benefit all Canadians and not just a small segment of the population.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3781715">I do want to focus my remarks and ask the member opposite to comment on pension income splitting. If I understood him correctly, he was in fact quite critical of the measure brought in by our government in 2006 to allow pensioners to split their income. In fact, he said this was sort of a foreshadowing of what would happen under income splitting generally. Pension income splitting has been a resounding success. I have certainly heard it across the country. Pensioners come up and say that they have been able to keep much more of their income in their pockets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781716"> I would just ask the member to clarify NDP policy on this. The NDP opposed it at the time, but does the NDP still oppose pension income splitting, and would it reverse that policy if it were given the opportunity?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3781718">His question is relevant, but this is not necessarily about whether we would support it or not. My argument about pension income splitting focused on program logistics. Generally speaking, pensioners do not have as much income. Therefore, this will impact their income differently than it will the income of the general population.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781719">If we look at the results, this program requires far more tax expenditures than initially forecast. There was no calibration at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781720">Then, if you take everyone who is retired and divide them into two groups—one group for those with a higher income and the other with a lower income compared to the median—it becomes clear that 98% of the tax breaks will go to the 50% of pensioners who have a higher income.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781721">Those who really need it, the people in the 50% with the lower income, will not benefit very much. It might lower their taxes by less than $20. Those who benefit are the retirees with a higher income.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3781735">Yes, I think the situation is a bone of contention, which has been widely reported in the media. The controversy did in fact start when Mr. Flaherty expressed serious reservations about whether income splitting was viable and appropriate. We then saw that the members of the Conservative caucus where very divided on it. There are some who are very much in favour of this measure. The voices supporting it are generally the ones of social Conservatives. That is because income splitting is an incentive. This measure is seen by a number of groups who are in favour of social conservatism in Canada as a measure that will encourage women to stay at home. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781736">Take, for example, people with incomes of $100,000 or $150,000. Whether we like it or not, income disparity in our society is still considerable. There are significantly more men than women with high incomes. Clearly, if women stay at home, income splitting will be possible, whereas if women work, the gains will not be nearly as great. That might explain why the social Conservatives are in favour of these measures and why the fiscal Conservatives are against them. The fiscal Conservatives, as we see here, want the government to eventually use the surplus to pay down the debt and reinvest in important public services. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781737">In that respect, I can indeed see a division within the Conservative caucus, and I look forward to seeing how our colleagues opposite will vote on this motion.</ParaText>

If we look at pension income splitting, that is true. It does not benefit people in my age group. If I look at my parents, they are both school teachers. They have pensions that are very similar. They do not benefit as much from the policy. However, there are many Canadians across this country who benefit from pension income splitting who are very positive on that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781740">I think it is incumbent upon the official opposition to be very clear with respect to that policy. Would it reverse the policy of pension income splitting that was put in place by this government in 2006?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781741">Frankly, if the NDP ever forms government, I could see the member as a possible minister of finance. He is going to have to make that decision. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781742">I think the NDP needs to be clear with Canadians as to where it stands. Does it support the pension income splitting that was put in place in 2006, and if not, would it seek to reverse that policy?</ParaText>

What we have here is a measure that benefits primarily those with the largest pensions, and I am sure he would acknowledge this. If the government believes that tax relief should truly benefit those who need it most, this measure is not as effective as it could be. A the very least, it needs to be calibrated differently.</ParaText>

                <Quote>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781750">There is no drastic increase in income inequality. Income inequality has not increased in Canada in recent years. On the contrary, income inequality has decreased in Canada in recent years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781751">The problem is that the motion is based on the NDP's political ideological. It is not based on data, facts or statistics, which clearly show that income inequality has decreased in Canada.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3781752">In fact, contrary to what the motion would suggest, we have seen a reduction, not an increase, in so-called income inequality in Canada. The truth is that in the past many years, the Canadian economy, notwithstanding the impact of the largest global recession since the 1930s, has done quite well, as a rising tide has lifted all boats.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781753">We see that Canadians are generally better off in terms of their income. Canadians overall are significantly better off in terms of their net worth and assets. The lowest-income Canadians are better off as well. In fact they are closer to the mean than they used to be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781754">Child poverty is at an all-time low in Canada. The number of people living below the low-income cutoff, often referred to as the poverty line, has diminished. The government has eliminated nearly one million people from the tax rolls altogether, so they do not have to pay taxes, by increasing exemptions and other progressive measures in the tax system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781755">The entire premise of the NDP motion is incorrect. In fact, families at all income levels had higher incomes in 2011 than prior to the recession, according to Statistics Canada. With robust income growth, the share of Canadians living in low-income families was at 8.8%, according to the most recent figures, the lowest level in three decades. Let me repeat that. The number of Canadians living below the low-income cutoff line is at its lowest level in 30 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781756">That is not my opinion. That is not a figment of my imagination. That is a fact based on data from Statistics Canada. I would invite my friends from the NDP to actually contend with the facts on this matter, rather than reciting stale and misleading talking points.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781757">That is not to say that we should be satisfied.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3781760">Indeed, the median real income of Canadians, and this is very important, according to the recent study conducted by the Luxembourg Income Study and <I>The New York Times</I>, hardly a Conservative house organ, indicated that for the first time in history, Canadian median family incomes have exceeded those of the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781761">The American dream was always considered the gold standard in terms of middle-class prosperity around the world. However, according to this recent exhaustive study of all the available data, the Canadian middle class is better off than its counterpart in any other major developed economy in the world, having exceeded that of the United States. This did not happen by coincidence or accident. It happened, of course, because of the hard work of Canadians but also because of the prudent economic policies of Canadian governments, and I would submit this government in particular, which has reduced enormously the tax burden on Canadian families. We have reduced the tax burden, through 160 separate tax relief measures, by an average of $3,400 for an average family of four per year. That is not cumulative. That is to say that year after year, the average Canadian family is paying $3,400 less in federal taxes than it did when our government came to office, and that happened because we made necessary but prudent decisions to better manage our spending and decided that taxpayers would come first. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781762">Here is the basic problem with the motion in front of us. The NDP's view is that government should come first and that we should feed the insatiable appetite of government bureaucracies and programs by taxing people more. That is what drives policies that lead to unemployment, stagnant incomes, and fewer economic opportunities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781763">Fundamentally what this government believes at its core is that hard-working families know better how to spend an extra dollar than politicians or bureaucrats do. New Democrats have a different view. It is a defensible view. It is a view they sometimes obscure at election time, but their fundamental view is that they know better, as politicians, how to spend that extra dollar than working moms and dads do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781764">Take for example the issue of day care. The NDP and its Liberal friends on the left believe that we should raise taxes on hard-working Canadian families, so that they have to work harder and their after-tax disposable income shrinks, so that we can take that tax revenue, coercively taken from those families, and cycle it through the enormously expensive bureaucracy of the Ottawa government and then send it to the bureaucracies in the provincial governments, which will then cycle it through various programs. In the case of Manitoba, I recall the failed child care policy of the former Liberal government. What did it end up doing? It raised government union wage rates in the child care sector. It did not actually add a single child care spot.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781765">Again, that is a defensible view. It is a view my friends on the other side will articulate. They believe that we should put more economic pressure on hard-working families, more stress, and reduce their take-home pay by increasing their taxes in order to cycle all of that money through two bureaucracies and send it back out in the form of a putative public benefit, when huge amounts of those resources have, in fact, been absorbed by administration and bureaucracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781766">Our approach is different. Our approach is to leave the money in the hands of mom and dad in the first place, because we believe that they are the best experts with respect to child care, not government bureaucracies or politicians. That is why we introduced the universal child care benefit that sends a $100 cheque per child under the age of six to every family, which then gets to decide how to spend that themselves, rather than politicians and bureaucrats making that decision for them. It is very simple.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781767">It is also why we raised, by the way, the basic personal exemption. One of the issues I am going to get to is so-called income splitting, what I call family tax fairness. Under the status quo and a Liberal unfair tax policy, it is unbelievable but true that they actually used to say that a spouse working outside the home was of greater value to our society and economy than a spouse working at home.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3781768">They reflected the perceived devaluation of dads and moms who work at home by having a lower spousal exemption in the tax code than the basic personal exemption. For a two-income family with one spouse out in the paid workforce and another at home in the unpaid workforce, guess what? The person in the paid workforce would get a higher basic personal exemption against their income taxes than the spouse at home in the unpaid workforce. What kind of weird mentality says that dads or moms who are at home taking care of their kids or their elder relatives are worth less for making what is for many of them a sacrificial decision for their families? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781769">We believe that they are serving the common good, that such dads and moms are making a choice that is best for their families, which we should respect and not penalize. We should respect the choices families make and not penalize them for making choices that they think are best for themselves. That is why this government eliminated that one dimension of family tax unfairness when we raised the basic spousal exemption to be equivalent to the basic personal exemption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781770"> These are some of the reasons we have seen an increase in average family income and net worth. In fact, the median net worth of Canadian families has increased by 45% in real inflation-adjusted terms since 2006. Canadian children from poor families have a higher probability of moving up the income scale than in such comparable countries as the U.S., U.K., France, or Sweden. That is to say, not only do we have fewer Canadian families and children living in poverty than before, and not only are we at a record low in child poverty in this country, but we have greater upward social mobility for those families. We actually do have the Canadian dream. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781771">This is what <I>The New York Times</I> was so astonished by when this study came out last month. The so-called American dream, the notion of upward mobility for low-income families, had become much more of a dream than a reality. However, here in Canada, it is a reality. We continue to have a society characterized by such upward social mobility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781772">The facts are that the middle class in Canada is doing better. There are fewer poor families and fewer poor children and less income inequality, regardless of what the opposition says.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3781773">I would like to talk about the second part of the NDP's motion, which states:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781774">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...and that the House express its opposition to the Conservative income splitting proposal which will make this problem worse and provide no benefit to 86% of Canadians.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="3781775">Once again, the premise of the motion is incorrect. The New Democrats are wrong. They are mistaken.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3781776">With the premise of this motion, the opposition is simply wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781777">I find it very interesting that in the political rhetoric and positioning of the NDP, those members always talk about working families. The late Jack Layton, whose memory we honour, always focused on kitchen-table economics. In the last election, he visited a lot of families around their kitchen tables. Yet the position of the NDP here today could not be clearer. It does not actually support the family as an economic unit. Those members actually think that some families should be actively discriminated against through unfair preferences in the tax code. We fundamentally disagree.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3781778">That is why, in our 2011 election platform, the Conservative Party of Canada committed that if we balanced the budget, we would, at the end of our mandate, introduce family tax fairness by allowing splitting of income between two-parent families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781779">As the<Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1"> Prime Minister</Affiliation> has done, I am pleased to reconfirm that it is absolutely our intention to keep that commitment that we made to Canadians in the last election to introduce family tax fairness, to end the discrimination against certain families, to end the unfairness. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781780">How do we do that? I would like to accept the rhetoric of the NDP position and turn it into policy substance. When New Democrats talk about kitchen table economics and the importance of supporting working families, we do not just do that rhetorically, we want to do that substantively. We do not want to do it as a political tactic or trick. We want to do it by amending the tax code to say that we will treat the family as an economic unit, because after all, it is an economic unit. Is that not the point? Dads and moms who arrange their affairs together as couples with kids or other dependents are making a choice to share their property, to share their income, to share the burdens of life. In so doing, they become the best social programs, the best schools, the best crime prevention programs in raising children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781781">There is no social program that produces stronger social outcomes than a strong family. Can we all agree on that? We should be honouring and respecting the often difficult and sacrificial choices that families make. That is what family tax fairness through income splitting seeks to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781782">What does this mean? Right now, perhaps a dad in a family decides to stay at home to take care of young, pre-school children, or perhaps elderly dependent parents who are living with the family, and we will see more and more of that with the aging of our society. His wife or his spouse goes out and works and makes, let us say, $75,000 a year, which is not much above the average income level in Canada. I do not know why New Democrats are laughing. It is a lot less than they make as MPs. If the wife is the income earner making $75,000 a year and dad is at home taking care of young kids or maybe elderly parents, they end of paying 30% more in taxes, $2,000 more in taxes than a family making the same amount of revenue with both parents in the paid workforce.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781783">What this so-called preference, what this discrimination, what this unfairness does is say that the work the dad puts in at home does not have any economic value. The government says it is worth nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781784">I am not just saying this. I will never forget being in the opposition as revenue or finance critic asking the Liberal government why they permitted this tax unfairness against such families. The then minister of state for finance, the hon. Jim Peterson, for whom I have great regard, committed the ultimate political gaffe. He accidentally told the truth. He actually said the government believed that stay-at-home parents were not working. I guess he had never met a stay-at-home dad or mom, because they work harder than most of us do every single day of the week and they deserve our recognition and our support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781785">That is why the Royal Commission on Taxation in 1966 recommended that the appropriate tax unit should be the family, as the income and expenditure of two individuals are not independent when they live together. That is why the Royal Commission on the Status of Women, 60 years ago, supported elective joint taxation, voluntary income splitting. It is why the U.K. and France and most other developed countries treat the family unit as an economic unit for purposes of taxation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781786">It is about time that we said we value families, we support the choices they make, and we will end the unfairness. Will the opposition join us in that?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3781787">Mr. Speaker, essentially the minister said that income inequality is not a problem. Let us look at the statistics from Statistics Canada. Median income from 1976 to just a couple of years ago grew by a staggering 0.2% for the middle class. In 2002, the average CEO in Canada earned 84 times what the average worker in that same company earned. Flash forward 10 years later, just a couple of years ago, that went up to 122 times the amount for the CEO as compared to the worker. In 1982, the top 1% earned 7% of all of Canada's income. Now that same group earns 12%. We have seen median wages stagnate over that same period, but the minister denies that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781788"> Let us get to income inequality, which his colleagues ignored. Let us talk about who does not benefit from my friend's myopic vision of the world. People who make under $44,000 a year do not benefit. Would a couple who make $44,000 each but are both in the same tax bracket benefit? Absolutely not. Single parents do not benefit. People who do not have kids do not benefit. People who are divorced do not benefit. Of all Canadians, 86% do not benefit from this $5-billion tax scheme.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781789">The Conservatives have the audacity to talk about fairness. What about the 86%?

If I were making $60,000 a year, like most public sector union members who are the core of the NDP's constituency, I would be terrified of this guy becoming the finance minister because he thinks they are wealthy. We know that means that the NDP would impose bigger taxes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781791">We heard the same thing from the leader of the Liberal Party. He said he would not impose taxes on the middle class. Then when he was asked to define the middle class, he said that it excludes people who have assets like seniors on fixed incomes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781792">The data is clear. In the past decade there has been shrinking income inequality, fewer children living under the low-income cut-off than ever in our history, and the lowest level of families under the LICO in 30 years.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3781797">When the OAS system was designed in the 1960s there were seven retirees for every beneficiary and the average life expectancy was age 65. By the time we raise OAS eligibility to age 67, there will be one beneficiary for every working Canadian. The average age of life expectancy is now 76 and is going higher. Therefore, the Liberal Party's opposition to the modest, gradual increase in the age of eligibility for OAS is a fundamental reflection of how this is no longer the Liberal Party of Paul Martin and how this is no longer a Liberal Party of sound economic management.</ParaText>

Rather than just demagoguing on this issue, it is incumbent on any party that aspires to be government to tell us how they would pay for the entitlements of baby boomers if we do not have an age of eligibility that reflects growing life expectancy 15 and 20 years from now.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3781801">Mr. Speaker, indeed, the universal child care benefit has been massively popular for exactly that reason. It helps parents to make that choice. Admittedly, it is at the margin. It is not going to make a fundamental difference, but it helps. It helps a whole lot more than taxing families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781802">By the way, regarding the plans of the opposition parties to create a so-called “universal government Ottawa knows best child care scheme”, according to the advocates of this so-called child care, 1% of GDP would cost at least $18 billion. Guess what? That money is not grown on trees. It is not printed by the Bank of Canada. That money would come out of the pockets of taxpayers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781803">Do members know what would happen? The opposition would end up raising the GST back. It would take away the child care benefit. It would remove income splitting for seniors. It has pretty much admitted that now, since it is against income splitting. It would raise taxes on families in order to give them a punitive benefit. Who would the big winners be? The big government unions.</ParaText>

A constituent of hers, a family in her riding, making $50,000 would save $500 in income taxes through family tax fairness. Only the NDP could consider someone with a $50,000 family income as very wealthy, which is code for “we have to raise their taxes so that they are not very, very wealthy anymore”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781809">That is why NDP tax-raising policies are always against the advantage of people who actually want to be in the middle class.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781810">Let us be clear. Family tax fairness is not about a preference for certain families or people at certain income levels. It is about eliminating discrimination. It is about fairness. It is about treating people equally. It is about treating the family as an economic unit. If the NDP says it supports kitchen table economics for working families, why will it not treat families as an economic unit in the tax code?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3781812"> The widening income gap, whether on a global, national or community scale, is clearly a social justice issue. However, it also poses a threat to our prosperity, our safety and even our health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781813"> As a number of studies have shown, in a more egalitarian society, the poor as well as the rich are healthier. Equality benefits everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781814"> High income inequality, globally and in Canada in particular, is a concern to many people. Yesterday, Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the IMF, addressed the issue and called it an obstacle to our country’s return to greater prosperity. It is a problem that therefore needs to be addressed, not only for the sake of social justice, but also for the sake of our collective well-being. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781815"> Unfortunately, Canada has been moving in the opposite direction for a number of years now. The gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen, as does the gap between the rich and the middle class and the gap between workers and the big bosses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781816"> There is a tendency to place much of the blame for this state of affairs on Conservative government policies. Some of the responsibility must indeed be borne by the Conservatives, but at the same time we need to realize that they are not entirely to blame. In fact, 94% of the increase seen in income inequality over the past 35 years occurred on the Liberals' watch. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781817"> However, I get the impression that the Conservatives felt they had not done enough to widen the gap. They decided to press the issue. They have proposed income splitting for couples with children under 18 years of age. Basically, this will benefit mainly the wealthier members of our society. Under the proposal, one spouse would be able to transfer up to $50,000 in income to the other spouse for tax purposes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781818"> To better understand the situation, consider the example of an MP with children and a spouse who does not work. I think all of us can identify in some respects with this example. This MP would be able to transfer $50,000 in income to his or her spouse. I imagine that some MPs would be delighted to be able to do that. The problem is that while this measure may be advantageous for MPs and high income earners, for the vast majority of Canadians, it will be of little or no benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781819"> Let me describe to you those who would not benefit in any way whatsoever. There is no benefit for people earning less that $44,000 a year. A couple earning more than $44,000, where both spouses have relatively similar incomes, regardless of what that income might be—$100,000, $200,000 or $300,000—will not see any benefits if they are more or less in the same income bracket. Income splitting will not benefit single persons, childless couples, couples with adult children, single mothers and fathers, and divorced parents. For the vast majority of other people, the benefits will be relatively minor. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781820"> According to figures released by the C.D. Howe Institute and the Broadbent Institute, income splitting would benefit only 10% to 15% of families, and obviously the wealthier families. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3781821"> I have nothing against tax cuts, but they should target the people who need them the most. If we take a closer look at the numbers, we see that this measure will actually benefit 5% of the wealthiest families, at the expense of taxpayers in general, because public funds are involved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781822"> The measure would cost the federal government $3 billion annually to implement and, according to the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, the price tag for the provinces would be about $2 billion. There are quite a few zeros in $5 billion. I wonder if this government has given any thought to what it else it could possibly do with such a large sum of money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781823"> I can think of many things it could do. For instance, it could help every single family, not just the wealthiest, find housing. In one part of my riding, 25% of households with children live in one-bedroom or studio apartments. Yes, in Canada. I am deeply shocked.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781824"> Could the government not earmark the tidy sum of $1 billion to help people in this situation? Could it not set aside a little more money for seniors' pensions or for infrastructure that is in need of repair? Is there not some way to help all families, not just a few? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781825"> Unfortunately, this government would rather focus on a small number of Canadians who are already among the wealthiest citizens. This government is Robin Hood in reverse. It continues to raise taxes and cut services to the middle class. It chips away at EI, raises the retirement age and delivers a fatal blow to Canada Post, all for the sake of providing some tax breaks to the wealthiest members of our society.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3781826">Indeed, I would call this government “Dooh Nibor”, which is Robin Hood backwards. It continues to take from middle-income citizens who have trouble making ends meet, through taxes and cuts to services, to give to the wealthiest. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3781827">This bill has even more harmful effects because it might discourage women from joining the workforce. I am not the only one to say so. The rather well-known C.D. Howe Institute also says so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781828">It says that income splitting would significantly increase the marginal effective tax rate for most spouses with a lower income, which would create an obstacle to employment or a return to work. This would reduce the work experience of married women, who unfortunately often have a lower income, which would make them more vulnerable. The Institute is of the opinion that income splitting would not achieve its self-proclaimed objective of equality if the objective is to support families with children and that this measure could actually benefit families with no children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781829">Among the harmful effects of this measures is a geographic imbalance, in that some provinces would benefit from it more than others. One of the provinces that would benefit less is Quebec, which this government has completely abandoned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781830">It was minister Flaherty who said, and rightly so, that this was not really a good idea. For all these reasons, I will stand with my NDP colleagues and strongly oppose this bill.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3781836">Mr. Speaker, I know the minister across the way wants to ask questions of me as the finance critic that the NDP would not in fact reverse income splitting for pensioners. I think he can put that conspiracy to the side.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781837">To my friend across the way, I rarely do this, but for this debate it is important to have illustrations and make things personal at times. The way that the Conservatives have constructed this scheme, many families, what we sometimes call traditional families—father, mother and kids—would not benefit from an income splitting scheme, if they happen to be in the same tax bracket, if the kids are too old. There are all of these exemptions. There are more exemptions than inclusions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781838">However, those who will benefit are those Canadians where one of the couple is making a great deal of money and the other is making much less. That is the way that this is set up. For me as a member of Parliament, we are well compensated, on average $160,000 or so; ministers make more, et cetera. In my circumstance, the way that this is described, I and my family could benefit by as much as $5,000 or $6,000. However, those families that the minister and the Conservatives seem to care about, who are earning $50,000 or $40,000, who may even apply for this and be compensated, would earn a couple of hundred dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781839">Why would families in the very highest tax brackets get as much as $5,000 or $6,000 of benefit from a program, when they arguably do not need it, where the middle-income families, whom the Conservatives seem to care about suddenly, would receive almost nothing? What is the equity in that? How is that going to fix the income disparity that we see in this country?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3781842">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise today and speak, in the strongest possible terms, in support of the motion by my colleague, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170843" Type="2">Skeena—Bulkley Valley</Affiliation>. It is a twofold motion; it would do two things. It would first signal the drastic increase in inequality in our country, and second, more specifically, it would address the Conservatives' proposed policy of income splitting. I would like to address both of those in the short time available to me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781843">I am pleased to learn today that the Liberal Party is going to be in support of this initiative. The Conservatives are obviously deeply divided on this. Today we got an Orwellian rebranding of the income splitting proposal. I understand we are now to term it the “family tax fairness initiative”, which has a very nice ring to it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781844">Let me be personal for just a moment. When I was running for election a year and a half ago to represent the people of Victoria, I ran into a retired schoolteacher on a doorstep in Oak Bay. She asked, “Do you feel it?” I asked what. She asked if I felt how Canada is changing; if I felt how we are no longer glued together as a community as we were; if I felt the increasing gap between the rich and poor. She asked if that is the kind of community we want our children to grow up in. I said no. That is one of the reasons I am so proudly speaking in support of my colleague.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781845">This retired schoolteacher got it right. We can literally feel the change, and I do not want my kids to grow up in that kind of country. I want the kind of country I benefited from when I grew up in a lower middle class family where all opportunities were available, rather than creating a permanent underclass of the poor, and a few very rich people. That is the kind of economy I fear we are going to experience in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781846"> I am not just saying that from a fearmongering perspective. On April 3, a <I>Globe and Mail</I> headline was “Canada’s 86 wealthiest have as much as the 11.4 million poorest”. That is shocking. It is shocking that 0.002% of the total population is getting richer and now has as much wealth accumulated as 11.4 million Canadians. The top 20% have half the income, but what is more telling is that the top 20% now have 70% of the wealth of our country. Most Canadians understand that the current government has abandoned the middle class and the poor, with little job security and high debt, and so many of our fellow citizens are living paycheque to paycheque.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781847">Statistics Canada also showed wealth gravitating to the top. While median income rose almost 80% since 1999 to $243,800 per family unit, the top 40% possessed 88.9% of total net worth, leaving the bottom 60% with a mere 11.1% of the pie. The poorest 20% of family units had more debts than assets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781848">The author of a report by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives concludes, “If one Canadian makes $100,000 a year selling a company (or shares) while another makes $100,000 a year working at a job, the worker will pay twice the tax of the business seller”. We are in desperate need of Carter 2 in this country for a review of our tax system, which is only contributing to this increasing inequity, which that schoolteacher told me she felt so tangibly and which we all know is going on around us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781849">However, what about the new income splitting proposal, which has so divided the Conservatives, which is now to be called the “family tax fairness project”. It amounts to a tax break for the most wealthy. It would cost the federal government $3 billion a year without providing benefits to a staggering 86% of our families. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170843" Type="2">Skeena—Bulkley Valley</Affiliation> got it right when he said that the Conservatives are clinging to a bad idea due to “hubris and pride”, as he termed it. I just wish they would do what the famous former premier of British Columbia, W.A.C. Bennett, said: take a sober second look.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3781863">Inequality is what we are here, in part, to talk about today, because it has been spiralling out of control. The top 1% of incomes are surging. The typical Canadian family has seen its income fall for the last 35 years. The gap is getting bigger and bigger. We all know that. We all feel that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781864">Billions of dollars have been cut to social transfers by successive Liberal and Conservative governments, which has made things worse by reducing access to social programs for low income families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781865">When we cut transfer payments to the provinces, they get deficits. They get debt, but the federal government gets to brag about a balanced budget.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3781878">Mr. Speaker, income inequality has always been an important issue for the Liberal Party. A couple of years ago, the Liberal Party critic introduced a private member's motion that was ultimately passed by the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781879">With regard to the motion that has been brought forward today, I take some exception to the NDP aiming all of the criticism to the Conservatives and the Liberals. The NDP needs to recognize that there is federal-provincial joint responsibility with regard to taxation issues. A third party should be included in terms of what is being asserted here. For example, from 1991 to 2001 the NDP was in power in B.C. That government took B.C.'s level of income inequality from fourth place across Canada to the worst in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781880">Would the member not at the very least acknowledge that it is not just one or two political parties that need to improve? Would he not include his own party? If we want to get ahead on this issue of income inequality, we need to deal with its core issue and how we could best enhance that. Our motion that passed in the House two years ago was an attempt to do that. A committee would have discussed the issue and come up with recommendations and ideas that would have had a tangible impact.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3781883">Mr. Speaker, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the memorial ceremony for the RCMP officers who were laid to rest today in Moncton very close to my riding. We always need to recognize and remember the sacrifice that our law enforcement officers are prepared to make each and every day to protect the greater society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781884">I am so pleased to be able to participate in this debate today. It gives me the opportunity to provide the House with clear facts regarding our government's record, which has raised the income of the middle class and reduced the tax burden on low and middle-income Canadians. That is why our government's top priorities remain creating jobs, economic growth and long-term prosperity, and we will not be supporting this NDP motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781885">Conservatives know that the best way to raise the income of Canadians and their families is through a strong and growing economy. This means ensuring that Canadians have the skills they need to fill well-paying jobs that a strong economy will generate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781886">We believe the private sector creates jobs, not governments. This is why the government has put in place appropriate policies to maximize the growth in job creation and reduce inequality by reducing taxes, increasing support for hard-working Canadian families, promoting trade investment, supporting key economic sectors, making education accessible and affordable, reducing barriers to labour market participation and being responsible fiscal managers of the Canadian economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781887">The proof is in the numbers. Since the depths of the global recession, Canada has demonstrated the strongest labour market performance of all G7 countries, with over one million net new jobs created since the pith of the economic recession in July 2009.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781888">Indeed, because of this strong economy, the Canadian standard of living is one of the highest in the world. Canada's low-income rate has been dropping. In fact, it is at the lowest it has ever been. This is something the NDP like to ignore, but it is a fact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781889">Since the beginning of 2006, the take-home income of Canadian families across the board, and that is in all income groups, has increased by 10% or more. According to a recent Statistics Canada study, the median net worth of Canadian families is almost 80% more than the 1999 median and when adjusted for inflation, it is up 44.5% from 2005. Our government has helped the average Canadian family of four save close to $3,400 per year by cutting taxes over 160 times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781890"> It is clear that our plan has been working and Canadians of low and middle incomes have seen real tangible improvements in their bank accounts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781891">It is not just Statistics Canada studies that are validating this approach. The Parliamentary Budget Officer in a recently released report entitled “Revenue and Distribution Analysis of Federal Tax Changes: 2005-2013”, identifies that middle and low-income earners have accrued the greatest financial benefit, specifically those in the 20 and 30 percentile of income earners, or those earning between $12,000 and $23,000. This group of households has accrued an average increase of 2.5% in after-tax income resulting from the major personal income changes since 2005.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781892"> This is because we understand how important it is to create the right environment for businesses to grow and create jobs. We recognize how vital it is to ensure that all Canadians have an equal opportunity to share in the benefits of a strong economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781893">Through our jobs, growth and long-term prosperity approach, our government has effectively taken action that has improved the lives of Canadians at all income levels. This is why I find the NDP's motion so puzzling. The facts and studies validate our approach to creating the conditions for jobs and growth. I would think even the NDP would look at the hard facts and come to the conclusion that many Canadians have, which is that Canadians are better off today than they were in 2005.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781894">The growing wealth of Canadians ought to be something that all parties can agree on, because each and every member wants to see less poverty and more Canadians with employment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781895">We are not saying that we are done. It is quite the opposite. We are saying that we are just getting started.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781896">Canada currently has one of the lowest poverty rates among seniors in the world. It is lower now than it was under the Liberals, at 5.2% in 2011. The number of Canadians living below the low income cut-off is now at its lowest level ever. There are nearly 1.4 million fewer Canadians living in poverty under our Conservative government than under the Liberals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781897"> Our government has removed one million Canadians from the tax rolls, including 380,000 seniors. Since we took office, there are 250,000 fewer children in poverty than under the previous government.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3781898">However, we are not satisfied. As the <Affiliation DbId="194774" Type="96">Minister of Employment and Social Development</Affiliation> has pointed out, over and over again, there are still far too many people without jobs in Canada and far too many jobs in Canada without Canadians to fill them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781899">Our government believes more can be done with the training dollars we spend to lead to guaranteed jobs, which will improve the lives of Canadians and reduce overall inequality. We also believe that the best way out of poverty is a well-paying job. We believe the best way to reduce inequality is to create more jobs, and this can be done by improving and transforming our skills training system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781900">Let me outline some of the measures to transform the skills training system that will help Canadians get these available jobs and help Canada create more and better jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781901"> As the economy has recovered, these skills mismatches along with labour and skill shortages have emerged in certain regions in certain sectors, highlighting the need to transform training and give employers a role in deciding where training dollars will go. This is why our government introduced the Canada job grant. The Canada job grant will encourage employers to invest more in skills and training and be involved in decisions to ensure that training leads to a guaranteed job at the end of that training.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781902">The minister has reached agreements with all provinces to deliver the Canada job grant through the Canada job fund. The government is also committed to improving other labour market transfers to ensure that funds are being used to help Canadians obtain the skills they need for jobs in high-demand fields.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781903">To this end, the government is renegotiating the labour market development agreements with provinces and territories. These are over $2 billion training funds that come directly from the EI account. Currently the human resources committee has been studying the renegotiation of these agreements, and as a member of that committee, I look forward to being able to recommend to the minister some ways that we could improve these agreements to better train unemployed Canadians for guaranteed jobs at the end of that training.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781904">Our government is also investing $11.8 million over two years and $3.3 million per year ongoing from that to launch an enhanced job-matching service. This will provide job seekers with modern and reliable tools to find jobs that match their skills, and to provide employers with better tools to look for qualified Canadians to fill available jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781905">Through a secure, authenticated process, registered job seekers and employers will automatically be matched on the basis of skills, knowledge and experience. This proposed enhanced job-matching service will build on the launch of a modernized and easy-to-use consolidated national job bank.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781906">Our government has also taken steps to reduce barriers to labour mobility across provinces and territories by helping regulated occupations develop nationally accepted standards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781907"> To reduce non-financial barriers to completing apprenticeship training and obtaining certification, budget 2014 introduced a flexibility and innovation in apprenticeship technical training pilot project, which will expand the use of innovative approaches to apprentice technical training.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781908">In addition, budget 2013 allocated $4 million over three years to continue to work with provinces and territories to harmonize the requirements for apprentices, as well as examine the use of practical tests as a method of assessment in targeted skill trades. Apprenticeship training is an important part of the post-secondary education system, and is a key provider for the skills and knowledge necessary for jobs and growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781909">To further assist Canadians with training for a career in the skilled trades, budget 2014 announced the Canada apprenticeship loan, which would expand the Canada student loan program to provide apprentices registered in the Red Seal trades with access to over $100 million in interest-free loans each year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781910">This action builds on the existing government initiatives to apprentices and employers to encourage apprenticeship training and stimulate employment in the skilled trades. The apprenticeship grants are designed to encourage more Canadians to pursue and complete apprenticeship programs in the Red Seal trades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781911">In budget 2014, the government committed to take steps to ensure that apprentices would be aware of the existing financial supports available to them, while they were on technical training programs through the EI fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781912">These are all measures that the government is taking to ensure taxpayers are well served by the federal training dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781913">Our government recognizes that there are often challenges for under-represented groups, such as youth, people with disabilities, aboriginal people and newcomers to Canada, in obtaining the support they require for jobs and growth. Encouraging the participation of under-represented groups in the job market continues to be an important priority for all of us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781914">Our government provides over $6.4 billion to the provinces to support skills development and higher education.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3781915">I have already touched on two of the transfers, the labour market development agreements and the Canada job fund. There are other transfers, such as the $3.75 billion for post-secondary education that comes from the Canada social transfer, or the labour market agreements for persons with disabilities, which provides $222 million to the provinces for the targeted initiative for older workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781916">In addition to the money that we transfer to the provinces to help under-represented groups, the federal government directly spends almost $1 billion on skills development and higher education. There is a youth employment strategy which invests $300 million to provide training, internships, work experience and education for young people. There is the apprenticeship incentive grant and the apprenticeship completion grant, which provide over $110 million to help apprentices. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781917">There is a skills and partnership fund, which partners with employers to provide training for guaranteed jobs mainly in the resource extraction industry. There is the aboriginal skills and employment training strategy, which provides $336 million to support aboriginal labour market participation. There is the opportunities fund for persons with disabilities, which is providing real job experience for Canadians with disabilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781918">It is very clear from what I have just outlined that our approach is working and we have been raising the incomes of Canadians and their families. We have targeted initiatives for many different Canadians, for many different jobs and much different training to ensure we provide fairness across the board. We are continuing to equip Canadians with the skills required to obtain and keep the well-paying jobs available today and in the future. We are continuing to make smart investments in programs that are having real results for under-represented groups.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781919">The Conservative government will continue to focus on jobs, growth and long-term prosperity and put in place the appropriate policies to reduce inequality. That is why I will not be supporting this motion. I would encourage my colleagues opposite to look at the facts and reject the motion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3781926">We have lowered taxes across the board. Small and larger businesses pay lower taxes and they are the economic drivers of our society. Today, we have a low corporate tax system that encourages foreign and domestic investment and that invites companies to come here, stay here and employ Canadians. It invites small and medium-sized businesses to expand and grow. Therefore, low taxes is one of the best ways to try to ignite our economy and continue to respond to what was the largest recession since the Great Depression.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781927">We are on the right track, we are moving forward and our low-tax plan is bearing fruit. I want to thank my hon. colleague for supporting those initiatives that will create a robust industry in Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3781928">Mr. Speaker, it is the same old story, day after day. Our colleagues across the way have no comprehension of the immense gap between the rich and the poor. Every week, approximately one million Canadians use food banks to feed single-parent families or families with two or three children. This is happening right across Canada, in every region, in both rural and urban communities, even here in downtown Ottawa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781929"> I wonder why the Conservatives deny the importance of a social fabric here in Canada. What will be achieved by consistently giving more to the rich and less to the poor? It will lead to still more poverty and a high crime rate. The food banks are practically empty because people are donating less and because more and more Canadians are using them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781930"> The members opposite continue to bury their heads in the sand. Could it be that they no longer even walk down the street in downtown Ottawa and see the endless lines at soup kitchens and food banks?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3781945">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak to this motion. I think it is one that clarifies the differences here in this House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781946">We have had the Liberal Leader saying that he thinks it is a decent idea. We have the Green Party, which has it in its party platform, and we have the Conservatives going on about everything else except the topic of this motion today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781947">I think there is a reason for that. If someone in this House said they had a great proposal, to write an average cheque of $7,128 to 147,000 of the richest families in the country, we would all think they were crazy. An average benefit of $7,000 to 147,000 of the richest; that is what this policy would do. That is why, on this side of the House, we are fundamentally against it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781948">When we look at the total expenditure of $5 billion, which is $3 billion federal and $1.9 billion provincial, we think about how we could spend $5 billion. How about a universal child care program that would actually help families who cannot find a place to put their kid in quality care? How about a national pharmacare program that would help seniors living in poverty and struggling with choices between keeping a roof over their heads or buying pharmaceutical drugs. There are lots of things we could do with $5 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781949">Instead, the Conservatives are saying let us write a cheque for $7,128 to 147,000 of the richest families. It is beyond belief that they would say that this is a policy about fairness and tax relief for families. This is about aiding their richest friends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781950">I am amazed that some of the Liberals have gone against what the federal Liberal leader said at the beginning. We do not often see that in the Liberal Party. However, I would like to hear from the federal Liberal leader about whether he still thinks it is a decent idea. It seems like an indecent proposal to me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781951">I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="170154" Type="2">York South—Weston</Affiliation>, though I do have a lot to say on this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781952">Who actually benefits from this? We talk about the 14% of families who will benefit. For people in my riding making under $44,000 a year, there is no benefit. For a couple who make above $44,000 a year but are both in the same tax bracket, there is no benefit. For single parents, there is no benefit. For couples with no kids, there is no benefit. For couples with kids who have grown up, there is no benefit. For parents who are divorced, my favourite in terms of irony, there is no benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781953">In my riding, we have a pretty high percentage. I think 86% might actually underestimate the people who would be excluded. When we go through that list, it is just about everybody who I talk to on a daily basis who would get nothing out of this federal income splitting program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781954">What we have seen is growing income inequality, and this measure would simply fuel that inequality. The incomes of the top 1% or 5% have been skyrocketing, while the average family struggles to make ends meet at the end of the month. The gap between the ultra-rich and the rest of us in Canada continues to grow. Liberal and Conservative governments have done nothing to attack this problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781955"> I would rather that we were discussing a proposal like a living wage. When I was on city council in Esquimalt, before I came here, we had a long debate about the failure of the minimum wage to provide an income that people could actually live on, that could support a family in dignity. Instead of talking about income splitting that benefits the rich, I wish the Conservatives were proposing to talk about a living wage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781956">It was the Liberals who eliminated the separate federal minimum wage, in 1996. Now we have a situation where minimum wages continue to erode. In real dollars, we are probably still somewhere below where we were in 1976 when it comes to the minimum wage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781957">Who earns that minimum wage? The people who would not be benefiting from income splitting for sure, 41% of whom are women and young people. In British Columbia, 32% of minimum wage earners are between the ages of 25 and 54, and 9% of them are aged 55 and over. We are not just talking about teenagers going to school and living in their parents' basement. We are talking about people trying to build a family for themselves, support themselves in dignity, and even support themselves when their retirement income fails. Remember, almost 10% of those aged 55 and over are still working at a minimum wage, and most of them are women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781958">What would a living wage do? A living wage is the idea that we would pay an amount that two parents, both working full time, with two children, could provide the basic necessities. It does not include paying back debt, savings, trips to Hawaii, which is what I suspect many of the people who would benefit from this income splitting would use this extra income for. Instead, let us pay them a wage that allows them to live in dignity.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3781959">In April 2014 in greater Victoria, which I represent, that required a wage of $18.93 an hour. The minimum wage is $10.25, so people who are on the minimum wage are living well below what it takes to live a life of dignity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781960">Whenever we talk about raising the minimum wage, there are those on the other side who talk about it as a job-killing proposal. If there is any job-killing proposal, it is the income-splitting proposal. That is because it would take money out of the economy in Canada and give it to people who will spend it abroad, either investing or travelling, whereas if we put money toward raising the minimum wage up to a living wage level, those people just might have enough to buy a pizza for their kids at the end of the month. They just might have enough money to make repairs on their house. They just might have enough money to do things that stimulate the local economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781961">When we are talking about income splitting, I cannot for the life of me see how any of that is going to put money back into job creation and small business in my riding. It is actually going to take money out of circulation, most probably money that will end up being invested abroad or spent abroad on things like travel, or else money that will be spent on luxuries. Most of those luxuries are not produced in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="170462" Type="2">Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781962">There was a statement in 2006 that I found very interesting. It was cited by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. This statement was signed by 650 economists, including five Nobel laureates. Let me quote a sentence from it:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781963">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...a modest increase in the minimum wage would improve the well-being of low-wage workers and would not have the adverse effects that critics have claimed.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781964">It would not have adverse effects, so if we are talking about spending $5 billion of tax money, let us put it into something that alleviates poverty rather than something that aids those who are already doing well in our society. Let us put it toward incentives to create jobs at the entry or basic level. Let us put it toward training programs. Let us put it toward child care, and then let us put our efforts in the House toward making sure that people actually get paid a living wage in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781965">Earlier one of the Liberal members talked about making this a non-partisan issue. I guess what he means is that the Greens, Liberals, and Conservatives agreeing would somehow make it a non-partisan issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781966">At the fundamental nature of politics is what kind of Canada we believe in. I find this proposal for income splitting not the kind of Canada that I believe in, not the kind of Canada I want to live in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781967">Some of the residents of my riding might benefit from such a proposal, but when they actually see its huge cost and the vast majority of its benefit going only to the wealthiest and most successful, even those people who might benefit in my riding would have cause to think about it again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781968">Why am I so sure of that? Because even the former federal minister of finance, Jim Flaherty, said he had serious concerns about this proposal. If the Conservatives were not prepared to listen to Jim Flaherty at that time, I am not sure who they will listen to, but hopefully they will get a chance to listen to Canadians. When it comes time for the next election, I hope they put forward policies like this one, policies that clearly state their agenda, which is a devotion to trickle-down economics. Their idea is that if we give money to those who are doing the best, somehow they will invest it or spend it in such a way that the other 86% of Canadians can eventually benefit from it. We all know that this kind of economics simply does not work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781969">It is interesting to look at the people who have talked about income splitting and expressed their doubts. They range from the C.D. Howe Institute on the right to the Broadbent Institute on the left. Both found that the proposal would, as we have argued on this side, cost the federal treasury $3 billion. Both found it would cost the provinces, yet the provinces have nothing to say about it, because Conservatives never talk to the provinces. It would cost them $1.9 billion out of their tax revenues. Where are they supposed to find that?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781970">Very interestingly, in terms of the percentage of people who would not benefit from this measure, both the C.D. Howe Institute and the Broadbent Institute found that between 86%, in the case of the C.D. Howe Institute, and 90%, in the case of the Broadbent Institute, of the population would not benefit from this income-splitting proposal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781971">I wish we were talking about a living wage for Canadians who go to work every day, work hard to put a roof over their heads and support their families, and maybe put a little away for their kids' education or for their retirement. This policy of income splitting does nothing to favour those people. It benefits only the 147,000 richest Canadian families, and it would give them, as I said, a cheque for an average of $7,128. I do not think anyone would really want to go back and talk to their constituents about what a great idea that is.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3781973"> We do not mind the concept of income splitting if there are adequate resources to make it possible without shrinking the services that we need in the Canadian government.

              <ParaText id="3781974">Members of the party at the convention changed from supporting a carbon tax that could be used to offset income splitting to moving to a carbon fee and dividend whereby every Canadian would receive the benefit of essentially translating pollution into support for lower incomes and all levels of income. That provision means that income splitting is no longer possible under our budget, because it is about a $5 billion cost. If we do not have something to offset that $5 billion cost, then it is simply not possible to do it. Therefore, we would be distributing the carbon fee and dividend throughout the economy, and we no longer support the income-splitting provision to which my hon. friend referred this afternoon.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3781983">I do agree with the member. The question here is how to make the economy grow. Do we make it grow by helping the people who have already succeeded, the people at the top? Do we make it grow by redistributing some of this money that the Conservatives obviously regard as excess, this $5 billion they want to give back to the richest families, or do we spend it at the other end on a national child care program, a national pharmacare program, job training programs and apprenticeships, things that would help the people who work hard every day? These are the people who go to work every day and are still not earning enough to support their families in dignity.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="170154" Type="2">Mr. Mike Sullivan (York South—Weston, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3781985">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to talk about this topic, as it is a very crucial topic for a lot of people in my riding. I say “crucial” not because they are looking forward to income splitting, but because most of them, if not all of them, would not gain a single cent out of this income-splitting proposal that the Conservatives are suggesting is a great thing for the average Canadian.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781986">The average family income in my riding is $30,000 less per year than the average for the rest of the country. Almost all of the people in my riding have incomes under the cut-off point at which income splitting would provide a benefit to them. We would have a situation in which those most in need, and I include my riding in that category, would have significantly fewer government services, because the Conservative government has been cutting back on services. They would have no additional income as they watch the cost of living and the cost of everyday items continuing to rise. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781987">For those individuals in my riding, those rising costs mean that they will continue to fall further and further behind. Some will fall into poverty. Some are already in poverty. They will certainly fall further and further behind, while some in the rest of the country, a very small portion, will actually do much better. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781988">We now have a situation in Canada in which the rich are getting richer fast. The various governments of the past 25 years have managed to create systems that are unfriendly to organized labour. Organized labour is one of the ways people improve their standard of living, but if the bosses who are making most of the money have governments that are unfriendly to organized labour, they do better, and the bosses are doing much, much better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781989">The top 1% of earners of this country paid a proportion of our taxes, and that proportion is shrinking. Since the Conservatives took over in 2006, the proportion of net taxes paid by Canadians to the federal government by the top 1% has shrunk relative to the rest. That means everybody else is paying more than the top 1%. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781990">This proposal by the government will make that situation worse, because those at the very top stand to gain by this income-splitting proposal, while those in the middle and at the bottom would gain little, if anything. As a result, the division between the rich and the poor in this country would get worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781991">In the city of Toronto, where I reside and where my riding is, a series of studies have been done by Professor Hulchanski on the city of Toronto. This professor has discovered that there has been a hollowing out of large sections of Toronto as a result of the abandonment of the manufacturing industry, something about which the current government has done little, if anything. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781992">With the abandoning of the manufacturing industry and the replacement of those jobs by retail and other service sector industries, the average income for the middle class in Toronto has shrunk dramatically, while the income of those who are doing well has grown. We have a hollowing out in the inner suburbs of the city of Toronto. About 30 or 35 years ago, these people were considered comfortable middle class. Now those people are on the edge of poverty, on the edge of homelessness, on the edge of not doing well at all. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781993">The proposal by the Conservative government does nothing to change this situation. It does nothing to affect the thousands upon thousands of Canadians who are near the bottom of the food chain or the thousands upon thousands of people in my riding who are recent immigrants to this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781994">One of the reasons there are a lot of recent immigrants in my riding is that the housing is relatively cheap compared to the rest of Toronto. My riding ends up populated with individuals who are barely scraping by. As a result of this proposal by the Conservative government, those individuals will gain absolutely nothing. Anybody making less than $44,000 a year will see no benefit, and the large majority of people in my riding make less than $44,000 a year. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3781995">The average income in my riding for families, which is the net income of everybody in the household, is something approaching $77,000. That includes those who are doing well, and there are some in the riding. For those who are doing poorly the average is $77,000. The average in Canada is a little over $100,000. We can see that we are already only at two-thirds of the income of the rest of Canada. To suggest a largesse of the current government to redistribute wealth by creating a system of income splitting would simply make the problem worse. It would simply create an untenable situation in which the wealthy in this country would get wealthier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781996">Perhaps it is a vote-getter for the base of the members opposite. Perhaps that is what is going on here. It is certainly not good policy, but if they believe that the rich should get richer and the poor should get poorer, and if that is who they are catering to when they are trying to get re-elected, unfortunately there are not enough of those people remaining in the city of Toronto to get them re-elected. I do not think the Conservatives are going to do very well in the next election. The people of Toronto understand full well that this proposal does not do anything for 86% of Canadian families. As for the 94%, the increase in income inequality, that is what the theory behind income splitting is. It is to redistribute wealth and maybe make income inequality less of a problem, but the effect of this is to continue the income inequality because those at the bottom will continue to be at the bottom. There is no benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781997">We would take $3 billion out of the federal treasury and $1.9 billion out of provincial treasuries and give that money to those people who are already well off. Maybe that would get them a few votes, and maybe that is the key demographic they are looking for, but it would not get the votes of the majority of the people in the city of Toronto, the majority of the people in my riding, and the majority of the people in Canada, 86% of whom will see little or no benefit to this very strange proposal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781998">Maybe there is an anti-feminist side to what is being proposed here because there are some members in the Conservative Party who believe that women should not be working, who believe that income splitting is the way to ensure that women do not enter the workforce. Already women only make 70% of what men make and as a result of income splitting, their incomes would be the drag on the family so it would be more likely that they would not enter the workforce. Those women, who tend to be the second earners in many families in Canada, would see that their contribution would be less, as a result of income splitting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3781999">We have situations where the government's proposal to income split would disadvantage the poorest, advantage the richest, and disadvantage the women in this country. Those are three philosophies that this party does not accept. We believe that if we are going to redistribute the wealth in this country, we should look after the poorest in this country first. We should look after seniors. We should look after women who make less than men. We should look after the middle-class people who have seen their earnings go off to the bosses and to the 1% of this country. We should look after the people who really need it first in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782000">The notion that we can take almost $5 billion in wealth and give it to the rich in this country is something that we are so opposed to. We are theoretically and philosophically opposed to taking money from everybody, because that is who pays taxes in this country, and giving the lion's share of it to those who make the most. It does not make sense. It is not something we should do. We will be opposed to that policy should it ever come forward.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3782034">Although the ride may have seemed like just one of a politician's professional activities, my involvement in the Baie-Comeau section of the event was primarily motivated by a desire to discreetly gather information and observations that might allow me to assess the cultural appropriateness of the approach used by those caring for a vulnerable clientele, 42% of which is made up of Innu and Naskapi young people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782035">As a result of conversations with Mr. Huard, the director of the Centre de protection et de réadaptation de la Côte-Nord, I come back to the House to report that the services are well tailored to the realities of a provincial clientele of young people, 117,000 of them each year, who most often come from dysfunctional social units. Having surreptitiously listened in on the discussions during our bike ride, I have no difficulty in concluding that the residents of the centre in Baie-Comeau enjoy outstanding guidance that is in clear contrast to the negligence that too often has marked their short lives. </ParaText>

That is why we contributed $1.2 billion to help developing countries do their part. We achieved all of this without imposing the NDP's $20-billion carbon tax on Canadians. Thanks to our actions, carbon emissions will go down close to 130 megatonnes from what they would have been under the Liberals.</ParaText>

Of those families who happen to qualify, who happen to fit into the narrow definition as proposed by the Conservatives, only a few of them will see the maximum benefit, and that would be those families and those individuals who happen to earn more than $150,000, like some members of Parliament. For average working families, if they are in the same tax bracket, if it is a single mom or single dad, if they do not have kids, or if the kids have moved out by 18, all of these Canadians, that is the 86% that we are talking about.</ParaText>

Canadian families, at all income levels, have seen increases of about 10% or more in real after-tax, after-transfer incomes across the board since 2006. The lowest-income Canadians have seen a 14% increase alone during that same time period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782290">Income inequality has not increased in Canada since 2006. In fact, it has decreased. Canadian families, at all income levels, have had higher incomes after taxes, after transfers, and after inflation, in 2011 and prior to the recession.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782291">Furthermore, the median net worth of Canadian families has increased by almost 45% in real terms since 2006.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782292">While the opposition continues to pose high-tax schemes that would actually increase income inequality and leave less money in the pockets of Canadians, our government is actually taking action and standing up for Canadian families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782293">Our Conservative government has been clear that one of the most effective ways to support Canadian families is by providing tax relief. It does not stop there. Our government has seen to it that the federal tax burden is at its lowest level in over 50 years. We have removed over one million low-income Canadians from the tax rolls completely. We have introduced nearly 180 tax relief measures since we took office in 2006, reducing taxes in every way the government collects them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782294">Let me list a few of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782295">We have reduced the GST from 7% to 5%. That is a 27% reduction in GST, putting more than $1,000 back into pockets of the average Canadian family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782296">We have introduced the landmark tax-free savings account, the most important personal savings vehicle since RRSPs. I must point out that more than nine million Canadians have since opened a tax-free savings account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782297">We have introduced the child tax credit, a credit on an amount of $2,255 for each child under the age of 18.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782298">We have introduced the universal child care benefit, offering families more choice in child care by providing up to $1,200 a year for each child under the age of six.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782299">The NDP members who stand today and claim that they know what is best for Canadians voted against every one of these measures. The opposition will continue to reject our efforts to keep taxes low. That is the reality we face. The opposition prefers that we adopt dangerous economic policies that would kill business investment and jobs, and hurt Canadian families by taking more of their hard-earned money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782300">We will not take economic lessons from the opposition. Let me remind the opposition that under our Conservative government, we have seen the benefits of Canada's economic action plan. Canada's economy has seen one of the best economic performances among all G7 countries in recent years, both during the global recession and throughout the recovery. This was due to strong economic leadership, fiscal discipline, long-term thinking, and tough decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782301">With that, I would like to take the rest of my time today to expand upon a few of the very important measures my colleagues on this side of the House listed earlier today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782302">To begin, let me take members back to budget 2007, when our government introduced the working income tax benefit, the WITB. The WITB fulfilled our government's commitment to help make work more rewarding for low-income Canadians already in the workforce. It increased the incentive for other low-income Canadians to enter the workforce, as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782303">Economic action plan 2009 went even further by effectively doubling the benefits provided under the WITB.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782304">Today, this initiative is making a real difference in the lives of Canadians. It has lowered the welfare wall so that low-income individuals now keep more of their earnings. In 2013, over $1.1 billion in WITB benefits were provided to individuals and families alone. Up to 1.5 million working individuals and families receive assistance through the WITB.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="20">(1520)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3782305">Recognizing that families are the cornerstone of our society, economic action plan 2011 took action to further reduce the tax burden on hard-working Canadian families. In doing so, we recognized that some families need additional support. For example, many Canadians have assumed added responsibilities by caring for infirm parents or other family members. Our government felt it was important to assist these family caregivers who make special sacrifices, often leaving the workforce temporarily and foregoing employment income.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782306">In support of these families who care for infirm dependents, economic action plan 2011 introduced the family caregiver tax credit, which came into effect in 2012. This 15% non-refundable credit on an amount of $2,058 in 2014 provides additional tax relief for caregivers of all types of infirm dependent family members, including for first-time spouses, common-law partners, and minor children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782307">To further help caregivers, economic action plan 2011 removed the $10,000 limit on the amount of eligible expenses a taxpayer can claim under the medical expense tax credit for a financially dependent relative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782308">Our government also recognizes that persons with disabilities specifically need assistance as well. Our support for them has been targeted and effective. This is evident through such programs as the enabling accessibility fund, which has funded over 13,000 community-based projects across Canada, totalling over $89 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782309">Even as recently as the measures in economic action plan 2014, our government has proposed to connect persons with disabilities with jobs by providing $15 million over three years to the ready, willing and able initiative of the Canadian Association for Community Living as well as $11.4 million over four years to support the expansion of vocational training programs for persons with autism spectrum disorder.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782310">That is not all. We also established the highly praised registered disability savings plan, or RDSP, based on the recommendations of the 2006 expert panel on financial security for children with severe disabilities. The RDSP is designed to help individuals with severe disabilities and their families save for their long-term financial security. Since its implementation in 2008, our government has made a number of improvements to the program. For example, to make sure that RDSP beneficiaries with a shortened life expectancy could access their savings, economic action plan 2011 provided them with more flexibility to withdraw their RDSP assets without requiring the repayment of Canada disability savings grants and Canada disability savings bonds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782311">In 2011, our government launched a review of the RDSP program to ensure that RDSPs were meeting the needs of Canadians with severe disabilities and their families. Based on the feedback received during the review, economic action plan 2011 announced a number measures to improve the RDSP. These measures provide greater access to RDSP savings for small withdrawals, give greater flexibility to make withdrawals from certain RDSPs, ensure that RDSP assets are used to support the beneficiary during his or her lifetime, enhance flexibility for parents who save in registered education savings plans for children with disabilities, introduce greater continuity for beneficiaries who cease to qualify for the disability tax credit under certain circumstances, and improve administration of the RDSP for financial institutions and beneficiaries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782312">Since becoming available in 2008, more than 81,000 RDSPs have been opened. Thanks to measures like the RDSP, our government is making sure that Canadians with disabilities get the support they need. A lot of credit should go to the late hon. Jim Flaherty, who championed this program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782313">Let me now say a few more words about the government's tax reductions for seniors and pensioners. Once again, on this subject I have plenty of material to draw from. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782314">Since 2006, our government has increased the age credit amount by $1,000 in 2006 and by another $1,000 in 2009. We have doubled the maximum amount of income eligible for the pension income credit to $2,000.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="25">(1525)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3782315">We have introduced pension income splitting for seniors and increased the age limit for maturing pensions and RRSPs to 71 years of age from 69 years of age, and much more. As a result of these actions, seniors and pensioners are receiving about $2.8 billion in additional annual tax relief. Overall, actions taken by this government have substantially increased the income seniors can earn before they are required to pay income tax. In 2014, a single senior can earn at least $20,050, and a senior couple at least $40,108, before paying any federal income tax at all. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782316">Seniors and those who support them may also take advantage of tax credits, such as the disability tax credit, the medical expense tax credit, and the caregiver credit as well as the family caregiver tax credit, which, as I mentioned, was introduced in economic action plan 2011 and came into effect in 2012.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782317">In the same year, our government enhanced the guaranteed income supplement, the GIS, for those seniors who rely almost exclusively on their old age security and the GIS and may therefore be at risk of experiencing financial difficulties. The measure provided a new top-up benefit of up to $600 annually for single seniors and $840 for couples and is improving the financial security of more than 680,000 seniors across Canada. This increase in economic action plan 2014 was the largest increase for the lowest-income GIS recipients in a generation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782318">That is not all. Our government, since 2006, has also lowered taxes in a number of other very important ways for families. It has increased the amount of income all Canadians can earn without paying federal income tax, increased the upper limit of the two lowest personal income tax brackets so that individuals can earn more income before being subject to higher tax rates, and reduced the lowest personal income tax rate to 15% from 16%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782319"> Our Conservative government has been ambitious in our low-tax agenda. It is aimed at creating a tax system that fuels job creation and economic growth in the economy, and as I mentioned previously, it allows Canadians to keep more of their hard-earned money. Tax reductions have also given individuals and families the flexibility to make choices that are right for them. While the opposition members argue that we are only helping higher-income Canadians, this could not be further from the truth. Low- and middle-income Canadians are receiving proportionately greater relief. Benefits for low- and middle-income Canadians delivered through the personal income tax system, and support for families with children, have also been increased and enhanced under our government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782320">Finally, let me add that new measures we have introduced recognize that the health of the Canadian economy ultimately depends on providing opportunities for a high quality of life for all Canadians. That is why economic action plan 2014 would continue to implement the government's plan for jobs and economic growth. It would connect Canadians with available jobs and help them acquire the skills that will get them hired or get them better jobs in the marketplace; foster job creation, innovation, and trade by keeping taxes low; reduce the tax-compliance burden; continue to provide Canadian businesses and investors with the market access they need to succeed in the global economy; and support families and communities by taking additional steps to protect Canadian consumers, keep taxes low for families, and improve the safety of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782321">To conclude, keeping taxes low is an important element of our economic action plan. It helps Canadians succeed in the global economy through the creation of high-quality jobs and greater opportunities for success. Economic action plan 2014 is the next chapter in our government's long-term plan to strengthen the Canadian economy in an uncertain world and to create jobs and growth while keeping taxes low for families and businesses and balancing the budget in 2015. It is clearly working. It is accomplishing what it is intended to do, and by returning to balanced budgets in 2015, it bodes well for not only the current generation of Canadians but for future generations as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782322"> Taken together, the measures our government has introduced since 2006 and those in economic action plan 2014 will continue to keep taxes low and help Canadians succeed in the global economy, creating jobs, growth, and long-term prosperity for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="30">(1530)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3782323">A recent analysis by <I>The New York Times</I> and the Luxembourg Income Study suggests that Canada's median income households today are the richest of 20 peer countries, including, for the first time ever, the United States. It also shows that Canada's median income households saw increases of about 20% in their take-home incomes between 2000 and 2010. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782324">Even the Parliamentary Budget Officer tells us that we have delivered $30 billion in tax relief, which is benefiting low- and middle-income Canadians the most. Again, this is leaving more money in the pockets of hard-working Canadians, and in 2014, that saving is to the tune of nearly $3,400 for an average Canadian family. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782325">Our record on tax relief is strong, and the results are speaking volumes. However, we have been clear that once the budget is balanced, our government is committed to even further, even greater, tax relief for Canadian families. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782326">I encourage the opposition, once and for all, to put aside its reckless high tax, tax-and-spend agenda and support our government's efforts to help all Canadians at all income levels. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3782328">Let us get down to business. The fact of the matter is that the middle class has been deeply in debt for many years. Under this government, household debt has increased and reached 165% of income. This is a very significant indicator of the poor financial health of Canadian households.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782329">However, the government keeps pushing for tax cuts, especially for corporations, which cost the treasury tens of billions of dollars. It dramatically increased the amount of dead money in companies' coffers, which did absolutely nothing to stimulate the Canadian economy. On the contrary, incomes are still stagnating. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3782331">Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague talks about household debt, and yes, household debt is a concern. The majority of that debt is in mortgages. That is an investment that will be going up in value over the years. With low interest rates, Canadians are able to afford that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782332">We have also been cautioning Canadians that interest rates will eventually go up, and they should be prepared for that scenario. When it comes to the actual net worth of Canadian families, Statistics Canada found that the median net worth of Canadian families has actually risen by almost 45% since 2005. This is a significant improvement in the wealth of Canadian families, who are benefiting from the policies of our Conservative government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782333">The proof is in the numbers. We have lowered taxes over 160 times, and the average Canadian family will have $3,400 more in its pockets this year than it would have had under the previous government. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3782335">The member just gave a great speech about the totality of the taxation reductions the government has given.

              <ParaText id="3782336">This is just another opportunity to lower taxes for Canadians. We have done it for seniors. We have done it for families. We have done it for children. We have done it for students. I know that students in Canada can now earn just over $20,000 without paying any federal tax. That takes individual policy changes.

              <ParaText id="3782338">Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague was absolutely correct. In fact, we have reduced taxes almost 180 times since this speech was written. This shows how quickly we are lowering taxes for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782339">To answer his question specifically, we have lowered taxes. The average Canadian family will have $3,400 more in their pockets at the end of 2014 as a result of our low-tax plan for Canadian families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782340">In addition, I should also point out that Canadian families at all income levels have seen increases of about 10% or more in their real after-tax, after-transfer income since 2006.

              <ParaText id="3782342">It is all very well to list 180 tax measures, even though some are still very marginal, but this does not address the heart of the matter. The indicators are very clear and the situation has deteriorated rather quickly. There has also been a dramatic increase in income inequality, and it has happened much more quickly in Canada than in the United States, regardless of what the studies might suggest.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3782358">Mr. Speaker, as a woman and the chair of the Standing Committee on the Status of Women, I am pleased to rise in the House today to support this NDP motion decrying the increase in income inequality in Canada under successive Conservative and Liberal governments and stating the NDP’s position on the Conservatives’ income splitting proposal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782359"> Pardon the pun, but there is a split between the perspectives of the Conservatives and the New Democrats. The Conservatives seem to want to return to the 1950s, as evidenced by the many retrograde initiatives they bring in. They are nostalgic for an era when the traditional family—as portrayed in the famous U.S. television series <I>Leave It To Beaver</I>—cast women in the role of housewife.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782360"> I was born in the 1950s, but I must admit that, as a woman, I am in not at all nostalgic for that period. Not only am I proud that, over the years, women have been liberated through numerous struggles, I am also proud of women’s participation in the labour force, their financial autonomy, and their political and economic leadership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782361"> However, we must not become complacent: although Canada ranked first in the area of gender equality according to the United Nations Human Development Report for the decade from 1990 to 2000, since 2001 Canada’s ranking has plummeted to 20th and 31st, respectively.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782362"> How is it that a progressive and modern nation like Canada could become a global laughingstock in the area of gender equality? Successive austerity budgets, starting in the mid-1990s, and recent fiscal policies have only widened the gap between the rich and the poor and deepened economic disparities between men and women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782363"> Even though about 70% of mothers with children under the age of five work, their employment rate is still far lower than that of fathers, according to Statistics Canada. In my opinion, it is our responsibility as parliamentarians to introduce policies to restore balance and establish working conditions that make it possible for parents—not only women—to balance work and family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782364"> In Quebec, the child care program has led to the creation of good jobs, and a 9% rise in mothers’ labour force participation. The program has also benefited the economy because every dollar invested has boosted the GDP by $2.30, according to a study by the Université de Sherbrooke.</ParaText>

In fact, the beauty of our federal system is the redistribution of wealth to reduce these gaps between the rich and the poor.

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782406">Everyone here seems to understand what income splitting for tax purposes means because we have been talking about this bill and thinking about this issue for weeks and months. However, for the average person in my riding and many others, who often struggles to do his or her own taxes, this notion might be somewhat abstract. I will therefore put my teacher's hat back on for a few minutes and try to give a simpler explanation of what income splitting is, so that everyone can follow the debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782407">Income splitting is a very simple accounting procedure that would allow spouses to transfer up to $50,000 between them for tax purposes. If this little shell game were adopted, one member of the couple would pay less taxes because he or she would be in a lower tax bracket. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782408">What is the purpose of this? It is to reduce the amount of taxes a couple or family pays. On paper, there seems to be little to criticize about this measure, since this tax arrangement would benefit families. However, it would not benefit all families, and that is where things start to go wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782409">This is what I would refer to as one of the Conservatives' so-called good ideas. Why is that? This idea is a promise that the Conservatives made in 2011, but that has still not been implemented, as I was saying earlier. It seems it will be in the next budget bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782410">Given how quick the government is to impose its ideology and force the House to quickly accept tax measures with little or no debate, the reason income splitting has not yet taken effect is probably that the Conservatives themselves are beginning to doubt that it is appropriate and effective and the Conservative caucus is far from unanimous on this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782411">Let us remember that the former finance minister—whose memory is honoured by many Canadians—had serious concerns about this proposal and suggested that members not support it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782412">Let us now think about who would benefit from this so-called good idea I was talking about. It would definitely not benefit all Canadians since its implementation would cost the federal government $3 billion and the provinces nearly $2 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782413">For years we have seen this government's incredible ability to offload expenditures onto the provinces in an attempt to help balance the budget. Once again, this so-called good idea does nothing for Canadians and it will upset any balanced budgets on the provincial side of things. It is hard to imagine that that is a good idea. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782414">The question is very simple. How will the <Affiliation DbId="204553" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> come up with an additional $3 billion? Will he take it from the employment insurance surplus or will he make more cuts to public services?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="00">(1600)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3782415">The question remains. We have already seen the damage this government's fiscal policy has caused. It would be quite sad to see the government make even more cuts to public services and misuse funds that have been earmarked for other purposes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782416">Who will benefit from this so-called good idea? Families, perhaps? Not even. Families with the greatest need are probably not the ones who will get the money. According to some reports, nearly 90% of families with children under 18 will not benefit significantly from income splitting. None of them. That is basically what that is saying. It means that this measure, while flashy and impressive, is missing the mark. It is counterproductive to make a law or policy that misses the mark, especially a fiscal one. A 2011 report by the C.D. Howe Institute, which is not known for being particularly leftist, made the exact same observations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782417">Could this measure help or benefit women? We in the NDP often analyze a legal or a budget provision through that prism, the prism of gender equality. With this income splitting measure, will women be able to move closer to pay equality? Well, no, it does not seem that the measure has hit the jackpot in that category either. Income splitting will also have undesirable consequences by discouraging women from entering, returning to, or even remaining in the labour force. The Conservatives' proposal will result in a major increase in the effective marginal tax rate for the spouse generating the lower income.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782418">The measure therefore will not benefit women and it will not benefit Canadians. We wonder whether perhaps it will benefit the regions. We recall the Conservatives' wonderful slogan, “Our region in power”. Do we have a measure that meets the needs of the regions? No, we do not. Mission unaccomplished, yet again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782419">The ink is hardly dry on a report from the Broadbent Institute that sheds some very interesting light on the matter. I would describe that light as having more to do with partisan politics than with the economy and taxes. The report points out that this proposed measure would do much less for some provinces and somewhat less for others. I will let my colleagues guess the picture it paints, but for the benefit of those who are watching, I will say that among families with children under 18 years of age at home—the Conservatives' main target group, by the way—those living in Alberta would benefit most from income splitting. What a coincidence. They would save an average of $1,359 in taxes, while those in Saskatchewan would save about $1,070. As we all know full well, there are 42 federal constituencies in those two provinces and they elected 40 Conservative members in 2011. Again, just a coincidence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782420">In the face of the Conservatives' so-called good ideas about taxes, the proper instinct is always to ask who benefits. As it turns out, it is Conservative Party voters once again. At the other end of the scale, families in Prince Edward Island and Quebec will save very little, if anything at all. In those provinces, as we know, nary a Conservative is to be seen.</ParaText>

However, we have said that, once we reach balance and start looking at possible surpluses, we will look for ways to give that money back to the very folks it belongs to. This is just another of some of the 181 ways, I guess we could say, that the Conservative government has found to reduce the tax burden on seniors, farmers, students, single parents, couples, and the list goes on.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3782439">It is a real honour and a pleasure to be talking about this subject here in this House today. Rising income inequality is one of the most striking and most important new characteristics of the 21st century economy. It is a way the world economy and, particularly, the economies of the western industrialized countries have changed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782440"> For all of us here in this House grappling with that transformation, it should be our absolute priority to understand it and work on ways to make this new economy work for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782441">I would like to start with some data points. According to the IMF, since 1980, the richest 1% increased their share of income in 24 out of 26 countries. That is a really significant data point, because very often debates about income inequality happen in a national context, as our debate is happening here, and we lose sight of the fact that this particular story is a global story. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782442">Of course there are national aspects, but overall the shape of what is happening is something that is happening particularly across the western industrialized countries. We must understand that in order to really understand what is going on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782443">This is happening in Canada as well. In 1980, the top 1% collected $8 out of every $100 earned in Canada. By 2010, that had surged 50% to $12 out of every $100. In the meantime, middle class incomes in this country have been stagnating.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782444">In 1980, middle class families reported income of $57,000, and 30 years later they were still at $57,000. This growing income divide—and as I said, an income divide that we are seeing growing across the western industrialized countries—is also translating into a growing wealth gap.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782445">I would like to cite one figure. This is based on some very important research that Oxfam has done, which is really important and something for us to all focus on. Oxfam calculated that if we took the richest 85 people in the world, their wealth is equal to the wealth of the bottom 50% of the whole world, 35 billion people. That is just 85 people, which is a lot fewer than it would take to fill this House. It would fill maybe a quarter of my side of the House. Let us think for one moment about what that says about our world today and about how the world economy is working.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782446">It is important when we are talking about this, and particularly when our conversation moves to talking about political solutions, to really reflect on and acknowledge the fact that this is a new phenomenon. The world economy today is working differently from the way it did, particularly in the post-war era, when I think many of our conceptions of how the world economy works, and certainly many of our political ideas, were formed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782447">In the post-war era, we had a Goldilocks economy. It was a time when there was very strong economic growth across the western industrialized world, and at the same time income inequality was actually decreasing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782448">Starting about 30 years ago, that changed. Even as the economy grew, we started to see income inequality surging: a growing share of the income going to the very top and incomes in the middle either stagnating or actually declining, depending on which measure and which timeframe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782449">There is a lot of debate about what is driving this phenomenon. Inevitably that debate becomes politically tinged. All of us who approach honestly what is happening will have to agree that there are three primary drivers. One of them is in fact political. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782450">The 30 years in which we have seen this surging income inequality across the west also coincided with the rise of neo-liberalism, what we might want to call the Thatcher-Reagan revolution. We saw a combination of weaker protections for trade unions, a culture that accepted higher compensation, particularly for executives—higher CEO compensation—a new philosophy of shareholder value in companies, lower taxes at the top, and crucially, deregulation of many industries.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3782451">Therefore there was this political element, and again that political element had national features, of course, but it was also something that happened across countries, particularly because we are living in an age when so many businesses operate internationally and there has been, in many cases, particularly on the taxation front, competition across jurisdictions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782452">However, there are also two other factors that are really important drivers of what is going on, and those are globalization and the technology revolution. For me, those two factors are the ones on which it is really important to focus; and it is important for all of us, particularly those who see rising income inequality as a huge problem, to acknowledge that these two drivers of rising income inequality are also very positive. That is the paradoxical nature of what is going on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782453">The technology revolution, bringing us so many pluses, is also a driver of increasing income inequality. The same is true of globalization. If we are blind to that paradoxical nature of what is happening, we are not going to be able to come up with good solutions. Particularly when it comes to the technology revolution, it is important for us to understand something. I will refer to one of my favourite books on the subject, <I>The Second Machine Age</I> by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee. They argue that there is no law in economics that provides that the technology revolution will lead to more jobs or evenly distributed rewards. That is really important to bear in mind. Changes in the economy, which are good in aggregate, may not be good for individuals, and it is going to be our job as legislators to find ways to strike that balance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782454">What can we do about this? I have talked about something that is big, that is new, and that is global. How can we cope with it? I would like to quickly talk about five ways in which we can approach it. The first is to do no harm, and that is why we in the Liberal Party are absolutely opposed to income splitting. At a time when there are powerful economic forces, many of them good, which are driving up income inequality, introducing changes to our own legislation, rather than pushing back against them, and increasing income inequality is absolute political and democratic malpractice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782455">The second absolutely important thing is to focus on equality of opportunity. A terrific Canadian economist, Miles Corak, has identified something that has been dubbed by his admirers <I>The Great Gatsby</I> curve, which shows that rising income inequality correlates with declining social mobility. We have to push back against that, particularly with investment in schools, families, and early childhood education.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782456">A third area that is absolutely essential is to be open to innovation, particularly innovation for people who might not have the opportunities and networks. One thing we are seeing is that old businesses are dying. That is part of the technology revolution and of globalization. We have to be the country where it is easiest for someone with a great idea to start a new business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782457">Finally, and this is really crucial, we have to understand that we operate in a globally connected economy. We are living at a time when capital is global, but politics and legislation very often are not. If we want to capture the wealth that is being accumulated in the world, we are going to have to come up with some global answers. I am going to quote Larry Summers, the former U.S. secretary of the treasury, and then Pope Francis. Larry Summers stated:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The share of corporate profits taken by tax authorities around the world is probably a little more than half of what it was 40 years ago. And the reason is a basic process of competition, a basic ability to move business activity or to use accounting tricks to move income to low-tax jurisdictions.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782459">Therefore, we are going to have to work together to push against that trend.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="20">(1620)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3782460">In conclusion, I would like to cite a higher authority on why this is so much of an issue and that is, as threatened, Pope Francis himself. He has said that increasing income inequality is the root of social evil. I really believe that. I hope that together in the House we can identify this as a major problem and work together to try to fix it for Canadians.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3782474">Mr. Speaker, it is my turn to take part in this debate. First, I will read the motion:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782475">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That, in the opinion of the House, the drastic increase in income inequality under recent Liberal and Conservative governments harms Canadian society; and that the House express its opposition to the Conservative income splitting proposal which will make this problem worse and provide no benefit to 86% of Canadians.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782476">I will not get into how the NDP wrote this motion because, as usual, it is off the mark. The Liberals want to help the middle class so that it can have a better future. Income splitting is at the very heart of this motion. It is important to know how to draft a motion and set partisanship aside when the measure is this important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782477">The increase in income inequality is a significant source of concern in almost all developed countries, and governments of all stripes, including provincial New Democrat governments, need to do more to fight it. The Liberals are against income splitting as proposed by the Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782478"> In their 2011 election platform, the Conservatives promised to implement income splitting, but that promise was conditional on the government being able to balance the budget in 2015.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782479"> The Conservatives are getting ready to do that in 2015, since that will be an election year, but it will be the first time, given that they squandered the surplus that we Liberals had left when they came to power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782480"> Their proposal is clear: allow couples with children under 18 to split their income, up to $50,000, for income tax purposes. According to their platform, that measure would cost the public purse $2.5 billion, at the federal level alone, not to mention what it would cost the provincial governments, if they go along with it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782481"> How does income splitting work? I will explain, for the people of Bourassa, why we are debating this today, so they understand the meaning of income splitting. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782482"> It is simple. Take the example of two spouses who earn $100,000 and $20,000 per year. Together, they pay $15,993 in federal income tax. By splitting their income, that is, transferring up to $50,000 from one spouse to the other, so they declare $60,000 each, they will save $1,807. However, this does not provide any benefit for a couple in Bourassa, for example, who together earn $50,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782483"> The Conservatives have taken the idea of income splitting even further. In fact, in the budget they presented, they gave the example of a couple with two children: Bernard and Laurence, who earn $48,000 and $72,000 respectively. Even with those incomes, that couple will get no benefit from income splitting, however.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782484"> It is therefore clear that they want to implement income splitting in order to help the wealthiest Canadians. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3782485"> That is the Conservatives’ approach. In fact, there is a very clear example that tells us that if, in a family, one spouse earns $327,000 or more, the equivalent of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>’s salary, and the other earns only $3,000 or does not work, that couple will get $6,500 per year with income splitting. There is the proof. It is clear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782486">During the election campaign, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had said that income splitting should be one of our main priorities. However, as we have now seen, income splitting does nothing to benefit the middle class. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782487"> In fact, the study by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives confirms that when the budget is balanced, this promise will absolutely have the opposite effect: 10% of taxpayers will cash in and 50% of the poorest Canadians will get virtually no benefit. According to that study, families with income of $50,000 or less will save only $50. There is the proof.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782488">As well, the C.D. Howe Institute and the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives report that some 85% of households will not benefit from this measure at all. According to <I>La Presse</I>, since this measure is aimed only at the wealthiest Canadians with children under 18, that means there are a lot of people who will not benefit from income splitting. They include single people, couples without children and single-parent families. There is nothing for families with adult children, even if they live with the parents. There is nothing for families in which both children earn relatively similar incomes, which is most often the case in Quebec. Lastly, there is nothing for parents who earn less than $42,000 per year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782489">In Canada, the middle class has not had any real wage increase in over 30 years, in spite of the fact that the economy has more than doubled in size. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782490"> To summarize, with this measure, the rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer. There is nothing for single people or single-parent families. In a word, there is nothing for the middle class.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782491">It must be said that this measure also affects women to a certain extent, because all too often women have lower incomes in couples. That is what a study by the research chair in taxation and public finance at the Université de Sherbrooke tells us. The labour force participation rate of women with children is higher in Quebec, at about 82%, compared to 78% for all of Canada. The income gap between men and women is not as wide in Quebec as it is in other provinces like Alberta, where men make on average twice as much as women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782492">To conclude, it is quite natural for this measure to be controversial, even among the Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782493">I would like to quote the late Jim Flaherty:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782494">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">It benefits some parts of the Canadian population a lot. And other parts of the Canadian population virtually not at all. And I like to think I'm analytical as finance minister, so I will, when we discuss it eventually in cabinet, in caucus, I will present my analysis to my colleagues.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782495">Unfortunately, I feel that he is one of the only people who could have talked some sense into the Conservatives. We, on this side of the House, are against this measure, because we want it to support the middle class instead of giving the equivalent of $5 billion to the wealthiest Canadians.</ParaText>

I said that the wording of the motion was fine because it says that the drastic increase in income inequality under recent Liberal and Conservative government harms Canadian society. Income splitting, as presented, is not good. In other provinces, people know the NDP's position. They know that the NDP is part of that inequality. That is not the issue.</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782516">Income splitting would have no benefit for 86% of Canadians, but it would be a benefit to 14% of Canadians. What 14% of the Canadian population would that be? It would be the wealthiest, the best off, those in the highest income level. Members probably already knew that, because income splitting is a plan pitched by the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Conservatives, and the Conservative Party is all about big business, big money and big tax breaks for the wealthy. There is a big gap between the have and the have-not, a gap that is growing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782517">I will stop right there and shift gears. Let me talk about the 86% of the population that would not benefit from income splitting in my riding of St. John's South—Mount Pearl, in Newfoundland and Labrador. They are everyday Newfoundlanders and Labradorians. They are policemen, firefighters, teachers, nurses, government workers, waiters, fishermen, small business owners, single moms, single dads, construction workers, hairdressers, and so on. Members get the picture. Most ordinary people would not benefit from income splitting. They are the people that the Conservative government has forgotten, or left further and further behind or has no interest in helping.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782518">That does not go for all levels of government. There is hope out there. Take St. John's city council, for example. It is going where the Conservative government refuses to tread.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782519">While the Conservative government will not have anything to do with the national housing strategy and voted against a New Democrat proposal for just that and the Liberals, under Paul Martin, killed their national housing strategy, the city council in St. John's adopted an affordable housing plan this week that promises 500 homes by 2017.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782520">The plan targets rental housing, home ownership, energy efficiency and age-friendly homes. The plan is about affordability for “the people in the middle”, as one councillor put it. Again, they are the people, the Canadians, that the Conservative government has forgotten. They are the people in the middle. Well done, St. John's city council. It is so fabulous. It is so inspiring to see a level of government picking up where the Conservatives so desperately fail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782521">Who exactly is left completely left out of the Conservatives' income splitting plan? People making under $44,000 a year would receive no benefit. A couple that makes above $44,000 a year but where both people are in the same tax bracket would receive no benefit. Single people, couples with children and couples with kids who are grown up would receive no benefit. Parents who are divorced would receive no benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782522">Someone must benefit. Income splitting would cost the federal government $3 billion a year. That figure is from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. Who exactly would benefit from that $3 billion? It is none other than the best friends of the Conservatives. It is the wealthy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782523">Income inequality in our country is spiralling out of control. The incomes of the top 1% are surging, while the average Canadian family has seen its income free fall over the last 35 years. About 94% of the increases in the inequality over the last 35 years occurred under federal Liberal governments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782524">The latest Liberal leader paints himself as a champion of the middle class. He infers it in half of the questions he asks in the House during question period. We heard it today during question period.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3782525">However, the current Liberal leader cannot relate to the middle class, because he had nothing to do with the middle class. He could no more relate to the middle class than the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> could relate to a fisherman on the northeast coast of Newfoundland, or a housekeeper at the Delta Hotel in St. John's, or a farmer in the Goulds, or a waitress in Quidi Vitty, or a fisherman in Petty Harbour, or a street cleaner in Mount Pearl. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> cannot relate to those people, keeping in mind that he has turned his back on Newfoundland and Labrador.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782526">Income splitting will cost the Canadian treasury $3 billion, which will stay in the pockets of the wealthiest. At the same time, we are asking middle- and lower-income earners to pay more than their share. The Conservative government has done nothing to address or reduce growing inequality. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782527">This country is desperate for affordable child care, like the seven-dollar-a-day Quebec model. This country is crying out for pharmacare so that people do not have to make a desperate choice between food and medication.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3782529">The current Conservative government is failing our seniors, who do not have enough money to live on. It is failing students who are entering the workforce with massive anchors of debt. It is failing fishermen. I cannot leave them out. They are being squeezed out of an industry by a government that favours big business licence holders. Fishermen have had to choose between not paying federal licence fees and not paying bank loans. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782530">The current government is failing the middle class, yet it has the time to draw up tax schemes that only help the wealthiest 40% of Canadians. With so much to do, and I am not talking about pipelines, it is clear where the current Conservative government's priorities lie. Its priorities do not lie with ordinary people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782531">As the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives put it: “Income splitting creates a tax loophole big enough to drive a Rolls Royce through. It’s pitched as a program for the middle class but in reality it’s an expensive tax gift for the rich”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782532">The Broadbent Institute said, “It would increase inequality and is skewed heavily toward a Mad Men-style family with a high-income earner and a stay-at-home spouse.... Income splitting fails the fairness test”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782533">I will bring this back to the beginning. The motion reads: “That, in the opinion of the House, the drastic increase in income inequality under recent Liberal and Conservative governments harms Canadian society....”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782534">The words that stick with me are “harms Canadian society”. I have a message for the Conservative government, and the message is this: seniors matter, veterans matter, workers matter, students matter, middle- and lower-income earners matter, the environment matters, our fishermen matter, the east coast matters, and the 86% of Canadians who do not benefit from income splitting also matter. </ParaText>

First is that 86% of Canadians do not qualify for income splitting. Remember that number. Second, only 14% do. What 14% are they? They are the wealthiest people in Canada. We have 86% and 14%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782540">The other thing I want to point out is that the late Jim Flaherty also had his doubts about income splitting. If I have this correct, he spoke out against it before he, unfortunately, passed away. Maybe the Conservative government can learn from how Mr. Flaherty saw the light before he passed.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3782541">Mr. Speaker, the Liberal Party has indicated that we will be supporting the motion. The members goes to great lengths to portray how bad the Liberals are, then he focuses his attention on the current federal leader of the Liberal Party. One begins to think that the NDP is very nervous about the Liberal Party. Viewers should be aware that this is just as much an attack on the Liberal Party as it is raising an issue on the floor of the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782542">Citizens of Canada are aware of the inequalities and the need to address some of those inequalities. The leader of the Liberal Party has addressed that issue and will continue to push hard for the middle class.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782543">I take exception when the member makes reference to the leader of the Liberal Party. I question whether he is attempting to pass judgment when he says that someone cannot identify with the middle class. In fact, what I have witnessed is that the leader of the Liberal Party, no matter where he goes in our great country of Canada, is well received and respected by many as someone who identifies with the middle class. There is not a politician in this chamber who has been fighting harder for the middle class than the leader of the Liberal Party. I wonder if he might want to comment.</ParaText>

I will read the motion:</ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That, in the opinion of the House, the drastic increase in income inequality under recent Liberal and Conservative governments harms Canadian society; and that the House express its opposition to the Conservative income splitting proposal which will make this problem worse and provide no benefit to 86% of Canadians.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782548">This is of great interest to my constituents in Parkdale--High Park, because we have a very diverse community in the city of Toronto. We have very low-income people in the community. We have tenants. We have homeowners. There are people with varying incomes, single families. and non-traditional families. There are people who work in a wide diversity of occupations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782549">I would ask Canadians, through the House, especially members of my community of Parkdale--High Park, this. If they were to ask their government to invest $3 billion every single year on their behalf, how would they want it invested? They might ask for better housing. They might ask that every Canadian have a decent place to live. So many families would say to invest in a quality national child care system, like in most modern democracies around the world. Let us invest in our children first. Would that not be a wonderful thing for the majority of Canadian families to take advantage of?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782550">We have a baby explosion in my riding. Urban legend says that my riding has one of the highest rates of newborns. I do not know if that is true, but there are a lot of young families. I hear from so many parents that if they can even find child care, it costs them practically a second mortgage to pay for that service, because it is so expensive for parents across the country, except in the province of Quebec. While it is not perfect, Quebec certainly has a far better, far more affordable, accessible child care system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782551">Many of our community members might ask why we do not fulfill the dream of that great social democrat, Tommy Douglas. Tommy Douglas brought us medicare, and Canadians who have to stay in a hospital in this country thank their lucky stars that they have our medicare system and that they do not have to mortgage their houses or go into deep debt to have a hospital stay.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782552">Tommy Douglas had a bigger vision. He wanted not only acute care covered through our medicare system but also a pharmacare system. He wanted us to be able to afford the medications we need when we need them and not have to go into debt or choose between paying the rent and paying for the drugs we need. He also envisioned a home care system so that people with disabilities and seniors could stay in their own homes and have the care they need. He envisioned long-term care so that if people had to go into long-term care, they would not have a situation, as we do in the province of Ontario, where time and time again there are scandals about some of the most vulnerable people in our society, our seniors, people with serious disabilities, being exploited and not getting the care they need in private home settings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782553">We might want to fulfill his dream of a dental care program so that every person in this country, every child, every senior, had access to good quality dental care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782554">These would be some of the wonderful ideas Canadians could suggest for investing $3 billion a year.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3782555">Instead, the government would take $3 billion a year of Canadians' hard-earned tax dollars, taxes that everyone pays, and spend it on the wealthiest 14% of Canadians. Even in that wealthiest 14% of Canadians, two-thirds of the wealthiest would get maybe $500 a year, if they were lucky. They would get a little bit, but many of the people in the other third would get $5,000 or more back from our tax dollars. This is taking from everybody, especially the middle class, and giving to the very richest. It is opposite of Robin Hood, and it is simply bad economic policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782556">It is not just New Democrats who are saying it is bad economic policy. At the C.D. Howe Institute, the most credible economists in Canada today are speaking out against this measure. Even my hon. former colleague, former minister of finance Jim Flaherty, expressed his concern that this was not a good way to spend our tax dollars. I notice that even our colleagues in the Liberal Party have belatedly come on board and said they also do not think it is good policy. We are glad to see that change of heart on their behalf, because this plan leaves out nine out of 10 Canadian families. It is simply bad economic policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782557">Let us take a look at who is completely left out. Anybody who makes less than $44,000 a year is left out. If a couple make above that but are both in the same tax bracket, they are left out. Single people, couples with no kids, couples with kids who are over the age of 18, and people who are divorced are all left out. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782558">I want to say too that this proposal, this Conservative plan, especially when combined with the completely and indefensibly inadequate child care system in this country, would also encourage many women to just stay home. I think that is why many of my Conservative colleagues are so in favour of it. They have heard from REAL Women, the social conservative women's organization, which has said that it likes this kind of tax policy because it encourages the traditional family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782559">I am a big fan of the TV show <I>Modern Family</I>, because when I go out in my community of <Affiliation DbId="170382" Type="2">Parkdale—High Park</Affiliation>, it is more like <I>Modern Family</I>. However, this policy is more like <I>Leave it to Beaver</I>. That might have been a swell period after the war, and I am sure some of my colleagues across the aisle have fond memories of it, but some equate it to the <I>Mad Men</I> era, and Don Draper would love this policy. Don Draper would be able to claim the full amount under this proposal. He would love this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782560"> It is not proposing something that makes good use of our tax dollars or something that makes sense to the vast majority of Canadians and fits with the modern reality. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782561">This motion also points to increased inequality in Canada. We saw it skyrocket in the 1990s under our colleagues, the Liberals, when they made the biggest social spending cuts in the history of our country and cut the national housing program, the national minimum wage, and, sadly, many other programs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782562">What New Democrats want is a fairer, shared prosperity for all Canadians. We want to improve services. We would put $3 billion to work for the benefit of all Canadians. Whether living in my community or by the Humber River or in Parkdale or High Park or Roncesvalles, all families would benefit from those improved social services. They would not have to be Don Draper or the Cleaver family from the 1950s. We would enact modern policy to benefit all Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3782577">The most effective approach to raising the incomes of Canadians and their families is by creating jobs and economic growth. The facts support it and the results show it. John Chambers, the CEO of technology giant Cisco Systems, just said last year, “The easiest place in the world to do business is Canada. Their prime minister gets it. They make it easy for me to invest and do acquisitions there; they have a great education program and they have a great immigration policy”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782578">Through economic action plan 2014, our government has set out a plan for safeguarding Canada's economy by helping Canadians get the information, skills, and experience they need for the jobs of today and tomorrow. The number of Canadians living below the low-income cut-off is now at its lowest level ever. As a result of our government's actions, today the Canadian economy is remarkably strong, setting the conditions for Canadians and their families to succeed and enjoy a high quality of life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782579">According to the <I>Bloomberg News</I>, Canada is the best country in the G20 for business. Canada also leads the G7 for tax competitiveness. The winner: Canadians from all walks of life. The average Canadian family pays $3,200 less in tax each year under our government. According to a recent PBO report, it is the low-middle-income Canadians who are benefiting the most from our tax cuts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782580">There is more good news. Canada now leads the G7 in job creation, with over a million net new jobs created since July 2009. There are over 1.4 million fewer Canadians living in poverty under our government than under previous governments. We have one of the strongest fiscal positions in the industrialized world. We are getting our fiscal house in order and we are going to balance the federal budget by 2015. With the help of Canadians, we will continue to build on our successes and focus on the drivers of growth and job creation—innovation, investment, education, skills, and communities—underpinned by our commitment to lower taxes and return to a balanced budget in 2015.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782581">However, while we as Canadians have many reasons to be proud of our country, we must also recognize that there is much more work to be done. Our government recognizes that there are often challenges for under-represented groups in obtaining the support they require for jobs and growth. Those groups include persons with disabilities, aboriginal peoples, and youth. Encouraging their participation in the job market continues to be an important priority for us. As a parliamentarian, I have advocated strongly for reforms and improvements to help more Canadians with disabilities find employment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782582">This is important not only to promote their social inclusion and improve their quality of life; it is also important because we know that people with disabilities actually form one of the largest untapped talent pools in all of Canada. There are approximately 800,000 working-age Canadians with disabilities who are readily employable and have yet to find a job. Almost half of them have a post-secondary education, so it is clear that their education, skills, and talents are not being maximized, nor are these individuals getting a fair chance to find fulfilling careers. Eliminating the stigmas and removing barriers is key to seeing Canadians with disabilities succeed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782583">As a matter of fact, no government has done more than this government to support Canadians with disabilities. That is in large part due to the late minister of finance, the Hon. Jim Flaherty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782584"> Former Minister Flaherty was a major supporter of my recent motion calling for reforms to help people with disabilities find work, and he personally spearheaded real, concrete action in this policy area. Last year, for example, we announced a $2 million investment to support the creation of a Canadian employers' disability forum. Established by Canadian business leaders under the name “Canadian Business SenseAbility”, the forum will facilitate education, training, and the sharing of resources and best practices among Canadian businesses. We also made permanent the enabling accessibility fund and announced $40 million in ongoing funding for the opportunities fund in 2013.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3782586">Last year, we extended the labour market agreements for persons with disabilities. We are introducing a new generation of agreements with the provinces and territories this year. Our goal is to better meet the employment needs of businesses and the employment prospects of persons with disabilities. To further ensure the inclusion of persons with disabilities in the labour force, our 2014 budget proposed to connect Canadians with disabilities with jobs by providing $15 million over three years to the Canadian Association for Community Living's ready, willing and able initiative.</ParaText>

Improving economic opportunities for aboriginal people remains a priority for our government. At the federal level, we are taking action to help aboriginal people gain skills and work experience. We are doing that through investments and partnerships with the private sector. This includes three key activities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782594">First, nearly $250 million is being invested over five years to improve the on-reserve income assistance program to help ensure aboriginal youth can access the skills and training they need to secure employment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782595">Second, our government is investing $1.6 billion over five years in the aboriginal skills and employment training strategy. This is an integrated approach to aboriginal labour market programming that links training to labour market demand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782596">Third, the skills and partnership fund helps respond to the changing needs and priorities of the labour market, while providing opportunities for aboriginal people to fully participate in Canada's economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782597">In addition, economic action plan 2014 will help aboriginal people build a better future for themselves and their families. This includes $1.25 billion in support of the first nations control of first nations education act, $323.4 million over two years to continue to implement the first nations water and waste water action plan, and $303 million annually in support of first nations housing needs on reserves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782598">To paraphrase the <Affiliation DbId="194774" Type="96">Minister of Employment and Social Development</Affiliation>, the paradox of our time is too many people without jobs and too many jobs without people. One person said recently at our human resources committee that the key will be matching talent to task. Many unemployed Canadians do not have the right skills for the jobs available. It is particularly challenging for young people who do not have the skills or the work experience. That is why we need to do a better job of making a compelling case to more young Canadians to consider a future in the skilled trades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782599">For too long, we have settled for this beige, one-size-fits-all approach to youth employment, which has essentially been to tell kids to stay in school for as long as they can while in many ways frowning on vocational schools and apprenticeship training.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782600">The Government of Canada is helping Canadian youth get the skills employers are looking for with the Canada job grant, the apprenticeship incentive grant, the apprenticeship completion grant, the Canada apprentice loan, and through help from certain tax credits, such as tuition, education, and textbook tax credits.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3782607">Often for people who are in business, as I was in my previous life before I came to the House of Commons, income splitting was a common thing that went hand in hand with owning one's own business. A husband and wife were able to contribute to the business and split their incomes. In situations with persons, let us say, who are unable to work, this is of even greater benefit. These people are typically at the low and middle-income levels. I totally support our government moving forward on income splitting. I see a benefit for those families in situations where one of the potential earners cannot find work. The income can be split from one to the other and greatly benefit those in the low- to middle-income levels.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3782610">First, Mr. Speaker, let me say more broadly that the numbers presented are very skewed toward the situations that have been characterized by the opposition as somehow being a tax break for the rich.

              <ParaText id="3782611">I look at families of different natures in my riding, some of whom I have met through volunteer work in my life, and this will be a huge boon for them. This will give people the ability to have more disposable income than they ever thought they would have. Income splitting at all levels is a good thing. It would give people, especially at the lower and middle tiers, tax breaks that prior to this never existed. If we were to ask seniors right now what they think of income splitting, they will say over and over again it is one of the best things that ever happened. Now we are extending it to the rest of Canada and it is going to affect a much broader range than the numbers the member suggested.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3782612">Mr. Speaker, I am very delighted to join the debate here this afternoon. I have to start by looking at the motion that was put before us. I think there is a flaw in that very first sentence. The first sentence says, “That, in the opinion of the House, the drastic increase in income inequality...” and it went on to talk about recent governments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782613">I was on the finance committee. We did a pretty extensive study and we had a lot of complicated testimony. The motion starts off with a very flawed premise. I need to look at some of the statistics. I will be speaking to some of the statistics from StatsCan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782614">I heard the speech from the member for <Affiliation DbId="199815" Type="2">Toronto Centre</Affiliation>, but I think she left that issue off in the mid-1990s and was not reflecting what has been happening more recently. Again, we have some data that is very important that we need to consider.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782615">First, the share of the population in Canada below the low-income tax cut-off phase in 1995 was over 15% and more recently, around 2008, we are under 9%. Significant numbers of people were taken off the tax rolls. Indeed one million people, including over 300,000 seniors, have now been removed from the tax rolls.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782616">Another statistic is on median family income, including government transfers. It was steadily worse before 1998 and it has become steadily better ever since then.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782617">We can go into hourly average wages by gender. I know we still have some work to do in this area, but again, if we look at the graph starting in 1985 where there was a huge and significant difference, we see those graphs coming together where there is a lot less inequity in terms of wages by gender.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782618">An important thing is the share of market income by quintile. Again there was a noticeable increase in the share going to the top 20% before 1998, but there has been very little change since then. That is an important measure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782619">On share of income after tax transfers, again, there are relative income gains by quintile. We had another person who talked to us about mobility, the ability for Canadians born in low-income families to move into other income opportunities. Canada has very strong measures in terms. If one is born in poverty, one does not necessarily stay there for one's whole life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782620">These are all measured by StatsCan. Income share of the top 1% again reflects some pretty important numbers. It was at an all-time high in the 1930s and is significantly down. There was a bit of a burst, but now we are stabilizing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782621">I think we have to start by looking at the premise of the question. Income inequality is an important issue, absolutely, but it is wrong to suggest that this is a situation that we all have to be fearful about. The numbers show that since the 1990s we have had some pretty good measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782622">I would hasten to add that we should look at who has been in government for the last number of years. It has a large part to do with some of the policies implemented by the Conservative government. Again, one million people off the tax rolls is a hugely important number. There have been 180 tax reductions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782623">What the opposition members have not talked about is the report by the Parliamentary Budget Officer who said in total the cumulative changes have reduced federal taxes by $30 billion, or 12%. The low- and middle-income earners have benefited more in relative terms than the higher income earners. That is really important information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782624">We can look at what the NDP policies would be. The members went to the United States on an anti-trade mission to talk down our ability for the Keystone pipeline. We hear them argue against every trade agreement that comes before the House. They are anti-trade and anti-jobs. I could go on and on about the carbon tax they want to implement and the higher corporate rate for taxes. We would not have a problem with inequality if they were ever to make government, what we would have a problem with is everyone being in the low-income area because there would be no opportunities in Canada, so there would be no opportunity for inequality.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3782625">The other thing I found a bit disturbing is some of the talk I have heard today about women. I am really surprised that it is coming from the NDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782626">We have choices in Canada. When my children were young, I took on a part-time job by choice. It was not that I was being suppressed; it was the fact that I truly wanted that time and opportunity to be with my children, so I took a wage reduction and went into part-time work. At that time, my husband worked a little harder to see us through. We were not rich by any means. Certainly, I did not see that it impacted my ability to be fulfilled or my career opportunities. I made a choice in terms of my children at that time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782627">Men make these choices also. There are times when it is women physicians, surgeons, dentists, businessmen, and women in the trades. Increasingly, this is a choice that parents will make, and it could just as well be the husband who is staying home; and increasingly it is the husband. Therefore, it is absolute nonsense for the NDP opposition to suggest that this is something that is taking us back to the <I>Leave it to Beaver</I> times and that it denigrates women. Whether it is the male or the female, this provides the family unit the opportunity to decide how it will work and combine careers, because as we all know, it is tough when two parents are working. It is very busy, and if there is any opportunity to help the parents in terms of what they are doing and how they are doing it, we are a government that is proud to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782628">We believe that the most effective approach to raising the incomes of Canadians and their families is to grow the economy through reducing taxes, increasing support for hard-working Canadians, promoting trade and investment, supporting key economic sectors, making education accessible and affordable, reducing barriers to labour market participation, and being strong fiscal managers. The motion that the NDP has put forward is just plain wrong and ill-conceived. As a result of our government's approach, Canadians enjoy one of the highest standards of living in the world. The low income rate in Canada has been declining and now sits at an all-time low. We talked about how that changed. We can look at the graphs. Those are not made-up numbers; they are available from Statistics Canada because they are important numbers. Because of these facts, Canada's economy has demonstrated a remarkable capacity to create jobs, setting the conditions for Canadians and their families to be successful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782629">We often talk about our labour market performance in the G7, with more than a million net new jobs created since the recession. We still have a way to go. We recognize that we have a fragile economy and we have to watch what is happening, but we believe that families are the building blocks of our society and are critical to Canada and our long-term prosperity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782630">Since 2006, we have provided significant tax relief for Canadian families, and economic action plan 2014 continues on that track by keeping taxes low. These tax reductions give parents greater flexibility to make the choices that are right for them and help build a solid foundation for future economic growth, more jobs, and a higher standard of living for them and their children. Canadians at all levels of income are benefiting from the tax relief measures introduced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782631">
                <I>The New York Times</I> recently wrote that Canadian median incomes are the highest in the world. Middle income Canadians receive proportionately greater relief than the one million low income Canadians who have been removed from the tax rolls.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782632">There are many things that we have done, whether it is the Canada child tax benefit, the national child benefit supplement, the disability benefit, or the child tax credit. Of these investments, two-thirds go to the low income and modest income families with children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782633">Unfortunately, I do not have enough time to share with the opposition all the measures that create fabrics, such as the working income tax disability. They are a basket of tax measures that are targeted, that help different groups in our society in Canada to be the prosperous families and communities in the prosperous Canada that we so truly enjoy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3782639">Mr. Speaker, I would like to come back to the issue of income splitting and the inequality it creates.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782640">I know that the government made a promise in 2011. It was looking way ahead and saying that if it was in a position to balance the budget by 2015, it would bring in this income splitting. It would be very embarrassing for the government to backtrack, having made that solemn promise in the last election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782641">However, the evidence shows that income splitting in the way it has been proposed here, as it was promised back in 2011, would only benefit 14% of Canadians. The other 86% would not benefit in any way whatsoever. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782642">The government held the previous finance minister in very high esteem, and he himself recognized and said very clearly that he was definitely having second thoughts about income splitting. That was with very good reason, because he understood the consequences of it. Given that, does the government not recognize that moving ahead with income splitting the way it promised in 2011 is not the right thing to do for the majority of Canadians, and that it would, in fact, add to income inequality?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3782646">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak here today. I have a prepared speech, but listening to the debate we have had here in the House has made me think about how many people who sit in this House would actually benefit from this income splitting proposal from the Conservatives. I would argue it would be a lot of us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782647">I think about my own financial situation, and I would benefit from this. However, as a member of the House of Commons, my salary of $160,000 is ample. My wife's salary is a little less than that. It is also on public record. I am against this proposal because I think I am adequately compensated for the work I do. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782648">Everyone here in the House is really within the top 1% or 2% of Canadians in terms of earnings. Therefore, how could I in good conscience vote for something that would put an extra $5,000 in my pocket? I cannot. This is what is really disturbing me about this debate. Parliamentarians, we in the House of Commons, are here to be responsible with public money. We are not here to line our own pockets. That is what this income splitting would essentially do. I would estimate that probably half the members in the House of Commons would directly benefit from this tax proposal. That is really alarming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782649">Sometimes this is what is wrong with this place. We have really lost touch with what is going on in the general public. We have a high unemployment rate. Our economy is not scheduled to grow at the same rate as other economies around the world. I will talk about it in a minute, but we have this kind of massive inequality starting to grow between the people who are the top earners, like us in the House of Commons, and folks outside the House of Commons. Therefore, I think these types of measures are a mistake. We should be looking at ways to bring Canadians, who are not as fortunate as us to earn this kind of money, the help they need to move into the middle class or stay in the middle class. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782650">Again, I think this is really abhorrent and any Canadians watching this debate would be quite upset. They would be saying, “There they go again giving themselves a big chunk of money”. That is what is most disturbing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3782652"> Although we are talking about income splitting, at the core of this issue is income inequality in Canada. The Conference Board of Canada has said that income inequality is really looking at how income is distributed within a country. Inequality means that it is being distributed unevenly. Really, this is a principle of equity we are looking at. If there is a large income inequality within a country, as we see elsewhere around the world and increasingly in Canada, there will be problems. In some extreme cases there could be instability, which of course none of us wants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782653"> A common way of assessing inequality, used by most economists, is the Gini coefficient, which is a way of measuring this dispersal of income. A zero on the Gini index would indicate exact equality. That means everyone makes exactly the same amount. A score of 1 would mean that one person has all the money and everyone else has none. We have this scale between 1 and 0. Without taxation and social transfers like our health care systems, welfare systems, and EI systems, Canada's Gini score would be .44, which is classified as very unequal. However, with tax transfers the score drops to .32, putting us in a situation where we are unequal, but not as bad as some places.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782654">To put this in perspective, in South Africa, the Gini score is .63, which is the worst among most countries. Sweden is the best at .22. Canada is not as bad as South Africa, where we see extreme inequality, but of course we are not nearly as good as the Nordic countries in terms of redistributing wealth. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782655">According to the Conference Board of Canada, again, not an NDP publication but one we like to refer to when it gets it right, Canada gets a C. We rank 12th out of 17 peer countries. In fact, the real problem is that inequality in Canada has increased over the years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782656">Whatever we are hearing from the other side, it is really an undeniable fact that the richest group of Canadians has increased its share of total national income, while the poorest and middle income groups have lost share. Really, over this period of both Liberal and Conservative governments, our Gini coefficient has grown from .28 to .32. Again, it does not sound like a lot, but when we think about how many thousands of Canadians are affected, we see it is actually a very troubling trend.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3782657">One question is, what fanciful tax measures can we put in place? However, the real question is, what problems should we be addressing?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782658"> We do see some GDP growth, but it has slowed over the years. We have an economy that is sluggish but growing. However, our real problem is how we reduce this inequality. The Conservative idea of income splitting will do nothing to lessen the gap in inequality. In fact, it would increase inequality, which is a big problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782659">To put it plainly, the income splitting plan amounts to a tax break for the most wealthy, which will cost the federal government about $3 billion without providing any benefit to 86% of Canadian families. We have to remember that it is not just 14% of random families that would benefit, but 14% of the richest families would benefit from this, which troubles economists.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782660">I had the great privilege teaching at Simon Fraser's School of Public Policy. The professor who had an office beside mine was Rhys Kesselman, a Canada Research Chair in Public Finance. It was a great department. I am a raging lefty with the NDP, but we had a lot more centre-right colleagues to bounce ideas off. This was one of the ideas, along with the HST, carbon taxes or whatever else we would discuss. The great thing about academia is that one can throw ideas around.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782661">Professor Kesselman is largely credited for inventing the Conservatives' tax-free savings account policy. This is a man whose work they are not unfamiliar with on the other side. In fact, he supported greatly the HST within British Columbia, which did not go down so well. He is a very thoughtful man and the author of a C.D. Howe Institute report on income splitting. His report entitled, “Income Splitting for Two-Parent Families: Who Gains, Who Doesn't, and at What Cost?”, finds, similar to other reports, that 85% of households would gain nothing from this and a further 6% would gain less than $500.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782662">We are not just talking about 86% who would not be gaining. We are getting closer to 91% of Canadians who would not benefit from it. Therefore, it would be a very small segment of the population that would benefit. The richest 9% of Canada, like us in the House of Commons, would benefit from income splitting.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3782687">Canadians need a break financially. My constituents tell me this often. They work hard and they try their very best, but at the end of the month they still struggle to pay their bills, or afford adequate child care, or afford the rent and sometimes to put food on the table and clothes on their kids' backs.

              <ParaText id="3782690">The reality is that the Conservative income splitting scheme will not put even $1 back into the pockets of most of the people who I represent. In fact, 62% of Manitobans will not benefit from income splitting one bit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782691">Income splitting would not be a gift from the Conservative government to taxpayers. It would be a gift to their wealthy friends. It would cost Canadians billions of dollars to implement the income splitting plan and every Canadian would be paying for it while the same could not be said about the benefits. The question that New Democrats are asking is, how is this possibly fair? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782692">The New Democrats know that we can build a robust economy that will bring shared prosperity to all Canadians. Income splitting reveals, yet again, that the Conservatives only want to give tax breaks to their wealthiest of friends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782693">As the critic for status of women and as the member of Parliament for Churchill, I would call the Conservative income splitting plan nothing more than a smoke screen. It would not help lower income families, single parents or the majority of first nations and Métis people across our country. Not only would it not help the majority of women, it would have the potential to damage gender equality in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782694">I will discuss the many ways that income splitting has the potential to hurt the status of women in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782695">First, income splitting would not help single parents or single people. We know that many single parents, particularly many who live in poverty, are women. In some ways, income splitting would reward married people and punish single people, divorced couples, lone parent families and intergenerational families, meaning families that raise their children with the help of grandparents and other relatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782696">In my experience in my visits across my constituency, I meet many kinds of loving, supportive families. The last thing that non-nuclear families need is the federal government promoting a thinly veiled moral bias against them in the form of bad policy and regressive taxes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782697">This tax break effectively tells people that only if they are married and only if they are in a marriage where one spouse earns considerably less than the other, do they deserve a tax break.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782698">Many days in the House we wonder, given the policies put forward by the government, if we are going back to the 1950s or the 1850s. In the case of the income splitting proposal, the Conservative government is putting forward the classic vision of the 1950s family, one that might be modelled on June and Ward Cleaver. Earlier in the House I heard talk of Don Draper. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782699">The reality is that Canadians have moved on from the 1950s. It is 2014. The reality of the Canadian family is not that of the 1950s. We should be looking at what we need to do to support today's Canadian families rather than imposing a moralistic view of how the government sees families now.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="00">(1800)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3782700">Furthermore, 88% of lone-parent families are headed by women, and women, on average, earn 19% less than men, so when we talk about who benefits from income splitting, we are not only talking about wealthy people, we are often talking about men who are wealthy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782701">As I mentioned, income splitting will cost the Canadian public $3 billion each year and will deliver no benefit whatsoever to 85% of Canadians. This is a kind of reverse taxation system, where the large majority will pay their taxes into the pockets of the wealthy minority. As well, it would cost our provinces a further $1.9 billion every year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782702">I have one major question for the government. What else could we possibly be spending that money on? For starters, there could be a national child care strategy that would see every child in Canada receive high-quality, affordable care that could be established for a fraction of what the government wants to spend on income splitting. A truly national early learning program would cost $5 billion over four years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782703">Child care is currently costing the average family between $900 and $1,200 a month, a debilitating cost that too many Canadian families in this day and age cannot afford.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782704">Let us think of what it would be like to put most of that money into the pockets of Canadian families. Let us think of what it would mean for women to truly have the choice to continue their careers and care for their children as they saw fit, without economic duress being a contributing factor. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782705">I raise this example, because income splitting is not a take it or leave it program. With its price tag, it is either/or. We could either have our government spend our money on income splitting for the wealthiest, or we could have a national child care program, university tuition subsidies, a national housing strategy, or increased health transfers. Indeed, for the price of income splitting, we could have a bit of all of these things, and each one of these factors would contribute vastly to people's individual finances, their family's well-being, and the strength of our economy as a whole.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782706">We know that increasing women's equal participation in the labour force has a multiplier effect on the economy that would increase our GDP by billions of dollars. Child care is not only the right thing to do to give parents choices but is the economically smart thing to do for our communities and our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782707">Income splitting would hurt the status of women in other ways the Conservatives do not want us to know about. When higher income earners, mostly men, transfer a larger portion of income to a spouse, it makes it look as if the lower-income person is actually earning more than they are. Statistically, as I noted earlier, in Canada, due to the gender wage gap, this would likely be the female spouse. Income splitting would work to artificially inflate a woman's income. This would give us a false sense of data. We would lose sight of the persistent challenge women have in this country: earning equal wages. It would get even worse. When a couple broke up, it would seem as though one spouse earned more than they did throughout the partnership. This could have an effect on how much alimony or child support they would earn and could also have an effect on their child tax benefit once they were single. I can see this placing thousands of women in financially precarious situations, brought to them entirely by the government's plan for income splitting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782708">For these reasons and more, I am proud to stand alongside my New Democrat colleagues in opposition to the government's plan for income splitting. We want our taxes to work toward the collective good and for the health and prosperity of all Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782709">Conservatives, it is clear, want a system that benefits the few, not the many, and I believe that Canadians understand fundamentally how unfair that is.</ParaText>

This is an idea that they understand is fundamentally unfair, and I can guarantee that if they tell Canadians they could spend $3 billion on something that would benefit them, they sure would not be mentioning income splitting.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3782716">Mr. Speaker, in a previous question I asked someone on the government side, I mentioned the fact that 14% of people stood to make some kind of gain from the income-splitting promise the government made way back in 2011 but that 86% of Canadians would not benefit in any way whatsoever. I have to say that I was floored by her comment, and I would like to hear what my hon. colleague has to say about it. That member on the government side actually asked what was the matter with defending the 14% of Canadians who would actually benefit from this and whether I had anything against that 14%.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3782718">Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for that question, and I look forward to reading <I>Hansard</I> to see that insightful comment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782719">What we are seeing from the Conservative government is a real misreading of what matters to Canadians, but we cannot just leave it there. I made the comment in my speech that this is fundamentally about a vision of Canada they adhere to every single day. It is a vision where a few wealthy people, who also happen to be some of the Conservatives' friends, benefit. It is a vision where women in our country are worse off. It is a vision of leaving people at the margins and not investing in the kinds of programs that would benefit them and their communities across the country, no matter their income level, no matter where they live or who they are. It is a fundamentally unfair vision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782720">I share the concern of so many Canadians that our country is becoming more and more unequal. I would say that this is a warning sign. We know that as countries become more unequal, things become more difficult for people who live in these countries, if we look at health indicators and indicators of well-being.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782721">We have work to do here to turn the tide. Sadly, the Conservative government is keen on creating a more unequal Canada, whether in terms of gender equality or in terms of income inequality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782722"> I am proud to stand with the NDP, not just to fight against that inequality but to propose ways we can take our Canada back, our country back, and build a better country for all.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3782723">Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the very hard-working member for <Affiliation DbId="170270" Type="2">Mississauga—Erindale</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="194837" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782724">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond to the motion proposed by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170843" Type="2">Skeena—Bulkley Valley</Affiliation>. Today I would like to reassure the hon. member that our government's top priority is what matters most to Canadians, jobs and economic growth, while ensuring that all Canadians have the opportunity to share in the benefits of a strong economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782725">Just a few years after the worldwide economic crisis, the strength of the Canadian economy today demonstrates that our approach is working. I have seen first-hand how our low-tax plan is benefiting the businesses, families, and communities in my own riding of <Affiliation DbId="170479" Type="2">York Centre</Affiliation>. We have created jobs, kept the economy growing, and, I am pleased to note, will be returning to balanced budgets in 2015.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782726">Since we introduced the economic action plan to respond to the global recession, Canada has recovered more than all of the output and all of the jobs lost during the recession. Real GDP is significantly above pre-recession levels, which is the best performance in the G7. Canada has weathered the economic storm, and the world has noticed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782727">Both the IMF and the OECD expect Canada to be among the strongest-growing economies in the G7 over this year and next, with the strong fundamentals in place to perform well for the next 50 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782728"> For the sixth year in a row, the World Economic Forum has rated Canada's banking system the world's soundest, and KPMG's “Competitive Alternatives 2014” study ranked Canada the most competitive mature market country for business. Moody's, Fitch, and Standard &amp; Poor's have all reaffirmed their top ratings for Canada, and it is expected that Canada will maintain its AAA rating in the year ahead. Canada has leapt from sixth to second place in Bloomberg's ranking of the most attractive countries for business to grow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782729">Here is an important fact. Did members know that our government is also recognized internationally for increasing the wealth of middle-class earners? According to a major study conducted by <I>The New York Times</I>, Canada now has the richest middle class in the world. For the first time in history, Canadian middle-class families are better off than those in the United States. The study found that median after-tax income in Canada has never been higher and was higher than any of the other countries surveyed, including France, Australia, and the United Kingdom.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782730">Even if the Liberal leader chooses to ignore the obvious, the facts are clear, and the evidence is overwhelming. Canadian families are better off today under our Conservative government than they were under the previous Liberal governments. Today middle-income earners have more money in their pockets, where it belongs. Millions of Canadians who elected this strong, stable, national Conservative majority government did not just make a smart political choice; they made an informed financial decision, and that decision is paying off.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782731">According to Statistics Canada, Canadian families in all income groups have seen increases of about 10% or more in their take-home pay since our government took power. Statistics Canada data also shows how Canadians' wealth has increased dramatically under the leadership of our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. The median net worth of Canadian families has increased by a whopping 44% since 2005. This increase has been led by the middle class.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782732">Why are middle-class income earners doing so well under our Conservative government? One of the biggest reasons is our historic tax relief.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782733">As we all know, the man we know as the world's greatest finance minister, the late Jim Flaherty, delivered historic tax relief for all Canadians. In fact, under his steady hand, our government cut taxes for Canadians 180 times, so the federal tax burden is now the lowest it has been in over 50 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782734">The Parliamentary Budget Officer reports that we delivered $30 billion in tax relief, benefiting low- and middle-income Canadians the most. The average family of four will pay nearly $3,400 less in taxes in 2014.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782735">To the NDP members and the Liberals who scoff at this, for some middle-income families that could mean car payments for an entire year. That is right. We have made life more affordable for middle-income families, and the opposition parties have fought us tooth and nail on every proposal our government has put forward to put more money in the hands of middle-income families.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3782736">I remember the Liberal leader telling Canadians that budgets just balance themselves. I guess no tough choices, no discipline, and no savings are required for the Liberal leader. Instead, he believes in reckless spending and higher taxes that would eliminate jobs, stall our economic growth, and make it harder for families to get by.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782737">We have done the exact opposite. Since day one we have helped families and kept taxes low. Not only did we lower taxes for families but we cut taxes in each and every way the government collects them, whether personal, consumption, or excise and business taxes. Our tax relief included a reduction in the GST from 7% to 5%. It increased the amount that all Canadians can earn without paying federal income tax and reduced the lowest personal income tax rate to 15% from 16%. The TFSA represents the most important savings vehicle since the introduction of the RRSP. Due to popular demand, we even increased the amounts Canadians can save with their TFSA. More than nine million Canadians have taken advantage of opening up a TFSA account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782738">I am also pleased to note that last month the finance minister successfully secured commitments from Canada's largest banks to offer no-cost accounts for financially vulnerable Canadians. No-cost accounts will be available to youth, students, seniors qualifying for the GIS, and registered disability savings plan beneficiaries. This fulfills a 2013 Speech from the Throne commitment to expand no-cost basic banking services and to end pay-to-pay policies. This will benefit seven million Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782739">We have supported financially vulnerable Canadians. We have undertaken unprecedented action to benefit Canadian seniors. We have cut taxes for seniors and pensioners by over $2 billion annually. We introduced pension income splitting and pooled registered pension plans, and launched consultations on a new target benefit pension plan. Our actions have helped remove over 380,000 seniors from the tax rolls. In 2014, a single senior can earn at least $20,000, and a senior couple at least $40,000 before paying any federal income tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782740">Our government has also introduced a number of other targeted tax reduction measures. For example, we have helped families with children by introducing the child tax credit, the children's fitness tax credit, and the children's art tax credit. We have introduced the registered disability savings plan to help individuals with severe disabilities and their families save for long-term financial security. We have provided additional annual targeted tax relief for seniors and pensioners by increasing the age credit and pension income credit amounts, and raising the age limit for maturing savings and registered pension plans and registered retirement savings plans. We have introduced a public transit tax credit to encourage public transit use.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782741">At the same time, we have increased and enhanced benefits for Canadian families by introducing the universal child care benefit, introducing and enhancing the working income tax benefit, increasing the amount of income families can earn before the national child benefit supplement is fully phased out and before the Canada child tax benefit base benefit begins to be phased out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782742">What do all of these measures have in common? The opposition voted against every single one of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782743">As I have said, Canadians at all income levels are benefiting from tax relief introduced by our government with low and middle-income Canadians receiving proportionately greater relief. More than one million low-income Canadians have been fully removed from the tax rolls as a result of tax relief provided by our government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782744">Our recent budgets have built upon our record of supporting families and communities while establishing a path for returning to balanced budgets. Successive economic action plans have supported Canadian families by keeping taxes low, better recognizing the costs of adopting a child, helping to lower the prices of consumer goods, and better protecting financial consumers. The economic action plan continues on this track.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782745">From Detroit to Greece, the dire consequences of ongoing and growing deficits are clear. This is one of the reasons why our government has reduced taxes, to keep more money in the pockets of Canadians. We are committed to reducing the tax burden on Canadians in our forthcoming budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782746">Let me conclude by saying that I am optimistic about our prospects as a nation. The Canadian economy continues to expand, enjoying one of the strongest job creation records in the G7 over the period of the recovery. Over a million more Canadians are working now than during the depths of the recession, with the overwhelming majority of jobs being full time, high wage, and in the private sector.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="20">(1820)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3782747">While our jobs and growth performance is encouraging, we still have work to do. I am confident that economic action plan 2014 is the way to go. If we hold to the course we have chosen, our future looks bright.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3782779">Mr. Speaker, I am dealing with an opposed item, the opposed item being the estimates necessary to carry on the business of the Senate. It is the funding for the Senate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782780">This is an item the New Democratic Party opposes every year. Every year the NDP causes us to have to deal with the issue of whether or not the other place ought to receive any funding. The NDP's argument, as one can see from the debates in previous years on this matter, is to argue that the Senate has no legitimacy. That argument will be summed up with more finesse by one of my hon. colleagues on the New Democratic benches in time, but it goes something like this: the Senate has no place, as an appointed upper House, in a modern federation like Canada. We would be better off with a unicameral Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782781"> I expect NDP members would point to a number of other jurisdictions that have unicameral Parliaments, such as New Zealand or the various provinces, some of which did in fact have legislative councils, upper Houses, of their own in the 19th century. These were abolished in the course of the 19th century in Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Manitoba, and then in the course of the 20th century in Quebec. No other province has one. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782782"> That would be the essential argument they are making. The New Democrats would also argue that no change to the way the Senate is structured can make this body better than the situation we would have if we had a unicameral Parliament. That is the essential argument. It is a defensible argument, although I do not share in it myself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782783"> The trouble with this argument today is that we are facing a somewhat different set of ground rules than we were in the past. This argument was presented in the past with the symbolism of saying that the Senate is a morally bankrupt place and therefore we ought not to fund it. We all understand that in the end the funding will go through and the estimates will be approved, but we are making a statement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782784">That is a statement that no longer has very much moral resonance, and I would urge the New Democrats to perhaps refrain from opposing this item in future years. I will present my argument as to why this should be the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782785">What is different from previous years is that this year we have an answer to a series of questions that were posed to the Supreme Court last year regarding different ways of reforming the Senate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782786">Building on the fact that there was a consensus among Canadians that the Senate ought not to be an appointed body into the future, the government put forward a series of six specific questions to the Supreme Court of Canada, asking about different options for changing the Constitution in order to change the structure of the Senate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782787">These included a question regarding limits of tenure on senators: instead of being appointed to age 75, could senators be appointed for some limited term of perhaps eight, nine, or ten years? Six years is actually the standard we see in both the United States and Australia, and I would argue it is essentially the gold standard worldwide, but it had not been considered in Canada. We were looking at a longer term.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782788">Limitations on the terms of senators was a question that was asked in several different ways. What amending formula would apply to this kind of limit or that kind of limit on senators? What if it only applied to senators appointed in the future, or only to senators who had been appointed after the current government came to power or who had signed declarations indicating a willingness to step down?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782789">Second, the Supreme Court was asked about consultative elections. What if the federal government were to sponsor consultative elections, meaning a kind of plebiscite among the people of the province as to who ought to be appointed on their behalf to represent them in the Senate?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782790">Third, what about a federally sponsored framework under which provincial governments could enact their own legislation, which would be used for these consultative votes on who should be appointed to the Senate?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782791">Then there was a question that related to the repeal of property qualifications to be appointed to the Senate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782792">Finally, the Supreme Court was asked about just abolishing the Senate. Could it be done under federal powers? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782793"> The Supreme Court responded to all these questions.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3782794">To explain what happens next, it is important to remind people that there is more than one amending formula for the Constitution of Canada. In this respect, we are not like the other great federations of the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782795">The amendment formula for the U.S.A. is that if three-quarters of Congress and two-thirds of the state legislatures support a resolution to amend the Constitution, then that amendment will take place. The Australian system is that if there is a majority in a referendum in a majority of the states, then there can be a change to the Constitution. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782796">The Swiss also have a consistent referendum system. A majority of cantons must approve it, as well as a national majority. Similarly, Germany is also a federation, as is Austria. They too have systems that have one amending formula. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782797">However, in Canada there are five amending formulae. We have a system under which the federal government can unilaterally amend the Constitution, section 43 of the Constitution. Section 44 says that an amendment can apply to a single province. I am not working this through in the order in which they are stated. Section 38, the so-called general amending formula, says that certain aspects of the Constitution can be amended with the support of seven provinces having 50% of the population of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782798">Another formula, the unanimity formula laid out in section 41 of the Constitution, says that for certain kinds of amendments, every province must give its consent. When I say “every province”, what I mean is every provincial legislature, so in practice a section 41 amendment has to be supported by all 10 provincial legislatures as well as the Parliament of Canada. For the 7/50 formula, seven provinces with 50% of the population must consent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782799">It is not always clear which amending formula applies to which aspect of the Constitution. There are a number of areas that are unclear, none more so than the Senate. What the Supreme Court did in its ruling earlier this spring was lay out which of the amending formulas applied. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782800">The Supreme Court's opinion, right or wrong, is binding upon us. It turned out that the Supreme Court said that federally sponsored elections or federally administered elections, which is to say those conducted under provincial legislation that fits into the federal framework or those directly administered by the federal government, cannot be permitted. They are unconstitutional. The Senate cannot be democratized unless there is first a constitutional amendment that is approved by seven provinces and half the population of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782801">With regard to limitations on the terms of senators, it said that a limitation cannot be placed on a senator and that if a senator has signed a declaration in advance indicating a willingness to step down, that declaration is of no binding force or effect unless there is first an amendment that is approved by seven provinces with half of Canada's population. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782802">With regard to the question of repeal of property qualifications, right now there is a requirement that a person must own $4,000 of real estate, a more significant amount in 1867 than it is today, in the province he or she is representing, or a leasehold to that value. The Supreme Court said that requirement can be abolished, but unilaterally. The federal government can actually pass an amendment in Parliament that will strike down that provision, but not with regard to Quebec. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782803">In Quebec, there is a provision that one must own $4,000 of real estate in the electoral district that a person is representing in the Senate. One of the quirks of the way the Senate is set up is that senators from Quebec represent districts that were outlined in the census of 1861 for the legislative assembly of the United Province of Canada, and those 24 districts were frozen in place at that time and continue to be represented. There are all kinds of oddities involved in this issue. Quebec was geographically smaller than it is today, so northern Quebec is not represented by anybody. The northern two-thirds of Quebec has no representation at all. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="40">(1840)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3782804">The districts bear no resemblance to population patterns in Quebec today. Rural districts have almost no population, vis-à-vis the Island of Montreal, which has dozens of federal ridings but, if I am not mistaken, just two districts. That is an accurate reflection of the population of Quebec in mid-19th century, but not today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782805">If we wanted to get rid of that and say that people just have to be a resident of Quebec and that they do not have to own real estate in that particular district, we could not initiate that amendment. We could initiate it, but we could not follow through. The Quebec National Assembly must also approve it. We could not do something as simple as that unilaterally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782806">Finally, the Supreme Court spoke on the issue of the abolition of the Senate. This is the proposal favoured by the New Democrats. What the Supreme Court said was that in order to abolish the Senate, an amendment approved by all ten provincial legislatures and both Houses in the Parliament of Canada is required.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782807"> What we are talking about here is zero funding, but taking away the funding for this institution demonstrates nothing anymore. The Senate is unreformed because the Supreme Court has said that we cannot reform it. We really cannot abolish the Senate unless we get the consent of every single provincial legislature.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782808">However, it is more complicated than that. In 1996, in the wake of the Quebec independence referendum that got a “yes” vote 49.3%, if memory serves, the Chrétien government introduced a piece of legislation known colloquially as the regional veto act. I am going to take a moment to read the relevant parts of this very small act. It is “An Act respecting constitutional amendments”, and it was assented to on February 2, 1996. It says:</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782810">There we are. We have to have a majority in all of the regions before we can even introduce an amendment. This is significant because it means that we cannot initiate a proposal. A minister of the crown cannot stand up and propose to abolish the Senate or amend the Senate by making it more democratic, limiting terms, or getting rid of property qualifications unless the measure has first been approved by the government of a province. We are no longer able to initiate constitutional amendments under this legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782811">We could try repealing this legislation and then proposing an amendment to the Constitution regarding the Senate. However, right now that ability does not exist. While I understand the sincerity of the New Democratic Party members in their desire to remove the Senate, an institution that they regard as atavistic, the fact is that we are not in a position to make that change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782812">Ironically, they are in a position to make that change. No minister of the crown may make this change, but the member who proposed the opposition motion, for example, could, if he wished, propose a resolution to this effect. We could then see the start of some process, I guess.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782813">If they are sincere about some kind of change to the Constitution of Canada, it is time for them to start demonstrating it by putting something forward. Alternatively, they have friends in provincial legislatures. If they feel it is something that should be started at a provincial legislature and then carried on through a different legislature to adopt the proposal to change or amend the Constitution regarding the Senate, they could do that.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="45">(1845)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3782814">The point is that the ball is in the NDP's court. It is not enough any more to repeat what I think has unfortunately become a mantra—the mantra being that the Senate should be abolished—and now when anybody suggests anything about legitimizing that body any other way, they kind of stick their fingers in their ears, start saying, “I can't hear you; I can't hear you”, and discussion ends. New Democrats have picked as their alternative, as the one they are so closely aligned with, the single method that is the hardest to achieve. The fact is that all of these methods of changing and democratizing the Senate, making it a more modern institution, have all been blocked by the Supreme Court.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782815">Was the court right in what it did? Was it wrong in what it did? I am not one of those legal positivists who believes that every time the court rules, the court is automatically right because the judges are my betters and know better than I do in all respects. The fact is that they have the final say. Therefore, their word is law and we have to accommodate ourselves to that reality. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782816">The New Democrats have to accommodate themselves to that reality too, and it would seem most inappropriate, indeed, to withhold funding from an institution that we are not constitutionally entitled to change, on the basis that we think that institution is out of sync with modernity. It would be far more appropriate to try to find a way of helping to modernize that institution, and I look forward to any comments they may have as to how they would go about doing that.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3782817">Mr. Speaker, I have listened with fascination to my hon. colleague. He presents a very interesting point. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782818">The point he made, though, that the Senate is unreformed as a result of the Supreme Court ruling, is correct. The question is: Is it unreformable? I am afraid he might have missed the point of the issue of finances tonight. We, in the democratically elected House of Commons, have brought forward numerous mechanisms to ensure accountability to the taxpayers of this country, such as spending limits, limits on flights, accountability, conflict of interest rules, which the Senate decides it is above. It writes its own rules. It worked under the gentleman's code, which we see has resulted in numerous police investigations, and we do not know the end of it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782819">Regardless of the larger constitutional question we face with the Senate, the fact is that it does not seem to believe it is financially accountable to the Canadian people. Senators give themselves credit cards to travel with, to make purchases and then argue about it later. It has created a culture not just of entitlement but, I would argue, of corruption that does not exist in the House of Commons because we are accountable to the Canadian people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782820">Would he not agree that how we hold the Senate to financial accountability is a discussion that needs to happen here in the democratically elected House? Would he not agree that, if the Senate is going to continue as this anachronism in the 21st century, there should at least be some comparable measures or standards, even if they are similar to what the elected House has, in terms of conflict of interest rules, spending rules, and justification of spending, it would be an important first step and it is within the mandate of this House?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3782821">Mr. Speaker, I thought my hon. colleague raised quite a good point. There is the question of the internal reform of that House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782822">I must say I disagree with one unstated component of his observation, which is that lack of financial transparency and accountability is an inherent feature of an unelected House. The moat-cleaning scandal in the British House of Commons demonstrates quite effectively that elected people can be quite outrageous in their use of taxpayers' funds when there is not proper accounting. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782823">As to the point about the need for better transparency and accounting, I certainly agree that is true. My sense is that the Senate is working in that direction. Of course, it opened itself up to a very thorough audit, which is now going through all senators' expenses. I must say that seeing what is going on there is a good lesson to all of us that we ought to be very careful to adhere not merely to the highest standards that currently exist but to standards that might in the future be applied retroactively in the court of public opinion, so that even if one has not formally broken the rules, if one has violated what common sense would dictate ought to have been within the rules, one will face consequences in public opinion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782824">Certainly, the general observation that the upper House could use some internal reform is a proposition that is very reasonable.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3782825">Mr. Speaker, as always, it is a great honour to stand in the House representing the people of Timmins—James Bay. The motion before us tonight is on the funding of the Senate. I will not go through the issues of the constitutionality of the Senate in light of the Supreme Court ruling because I do not know if that necessarily needs to be the issue before us tonight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782826">We are talking about whether or not this body, which was appointed through political favours and choices without any check or balance or any mandate from the Canadian people, has a fundamental accountability to the citizens and taxpayers of this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782827">In the 21st century, I have a very hard time with the idea that an institution is above reform, that an institution cannot be reformed. To paraphrase G.K. Chesterton, the only thing worse than being priest-ridden was squire-ridden. I would say the only thing worse than being squire-ridden is being crony-ridden. This is what we have within this institution. It is an institution that sets its own rules, where people cannot be fired. That is a recipe for corruption and abuse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782828">This is not to say that there are angels in the House of Commons, certainly not. I would be the last one to say angels even set foot in this room, except perhaps the member for <Affiliation DbId="170324" Type="2">Sherbrooke</Affiliation>, who I am certain is very angelic at all the best of times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782829">We have a mechanism within our impure democracy and in our impure democratic system that people can be removed if they abuse the public trust, because they have to go back and get that mandate from the voters, but that does not exist within the Senate. So the issue is how we, as the elected House representing the people, chosen by the people of Canada to represent their interests, are somehow to be subservient to another class of people who are above the interests of the Canadian people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782830">This is the time of year when there is all manner of school groups and tourists visiting Ottawa, and they hear the tourist guides who tell them the wonderful story of the Senate. They say that when John A. Macdonald created the House of Commons, he had to create the Senate to protect the minorities, which is why we have a Senate that protects the interests of women, first nations, and people of colour. I hear that from the tourist guides, but that is not what John A. Macdonald had in mind as all. He was not worried about first nation people and women when he set up the Senate. Those were not the minorities he was talking about. He said there will always be more common people than rich people, so we need to protect their interests. Hence the Senate was born.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782831">Since we did not have the long history of the squire system and the knight system and the duke system, we had to do something of our own and that was to pick cronies. People who flipped pancakes at political fundraisers and did the glad-handing for the parties were appointed to the Senate and they were appointed for life. It was supposed to be a chamber of sober second thought, but it has not worked out that way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782832">The Supreme Court at this point is telling us that this institution is still politically untouchable for overall reform, but it does not say anything about the fundamental need to establish an ethical and financial code of conduct within the Senate to make it accountable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782833">I have heard from members on the government side that the idea of cutting the funding is absurd and it would be a fundamental attack on the institution. Let them look at the Westminster tradition where members of the House of Lords get paid if they show up; they get a per diem. In the House of Lords it is an honorary position. If we voted for that it would not change the constitutional requirements of the Senate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782834">That is the background of the issues. I would like to speak about the fundamental lack of accountability. There are not many things on which I would say I have ever agreed with Conservatives in my entire life. I could count on one hand if I held down three fingers. However, the one thing on which I agreed with the Conservatives initially, before they went off the rails and lost their light in the path of darkness, was the issue of the Federal Accountability Act to try to bring an end of the years of cronyism and corruption that existed under the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="55">(1855)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3782835">At that time, when the Federal Accountability Act was first brought forward, there was talk with the members on the government side about the need to establish one set of conflict of interest guidelines that would keep both the House of Commons and the Senate under the same set of standards, but the Senate refused that. The Senate said no; it would not be held accountable to the same standard as the members of Parliament are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782836">We have Senate conflict of interest rules, with a Senate Ethics Officer, and I have $100 for anybody who knows her name. They are like the Maytag repairmen; they never get out to check on ethical abuse. That is because they need permission. Senate ethics officers need permission from the senators before they can launch an investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782837">Again, there is the lack of accountability mechanisms. Within the Senate, senators are able to sit on the boards of all manner of corporations. We see them sitting on the boards of telecommunications companies, banks, individual financial institutions, and pharmaceutical companies, and yet these are the people who are reviewing legislation and initiating studies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782838">Why buy a lowly politician, a lowly MP, or a lowly parliamentary secretary, when corporations can just appoint a senator to their board and nobody pays attention?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782839">The senators, God love them, will say they only do these things in the interest of the Canadian people.

              <ParaText id="3782847">I was looking into this issue of the lack of accountability of the Senate and the kind of corruption that has ensued. Most Canadians do not know how the finances are done. In the House of Commons, we have to purchase something and then submit the bill to the House of Commons. It will look at the bill and decide whether or not it gets paid. If it decides it was not within parliamentary business, the bill does not get paid.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3782858">Right now Mike Duffy is being investigated for fraud, but I would refer members back to the RCMP investigation into Raymond Lavigne, who was found guilty of fraud and kicked out of the Liberal caucus in 2006. He hung on in the Senate until 2011 before he finally decided it was time for him to go. He left because if he was convicted, he would lose his pension, and so he left voluntarily. Now Senator Lavigne has been put in the hoosegow. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782859">If we look at the issues surrounding the Lavigne case of fraud, the RCMP raised all the red flags, which are being raised today, about the lack of financial accountability, the fact that Mr. Lavigne could call all the financial shots himself, even while he was committing fraud. There were no oversight mechanisms. This was known in 2006 and in 2011, but nothing was done about it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782860">Eric Berntson was found guilty of fraud in 2001. He resigned two years after being convicted. Michel Cogger was convicted of influence peddling. He resigned in 2000, two years after being convicted. We have the infamous Andy Thompson who became a senator and promptly moved to Mexico. He showed up 12 times in 7 years to make an appearance and let people know he was still a senator, while he lived on the beaches of Mexico. Hazen Argue was charged with fraud, theft and breach of trust.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782861">Now this is not to say that senators are more naturally corrupt than elected members. The issue is that we have accountability mechanisms put in place to stop issues of corruption whereas the Senate has steadfastly refused.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782862">The motion before us tonight is important because it is a question of whether the $90-some million that is given to the Senate every year has any strings attached to it, that there is any accountability mechanism. My colleagues on the other side will jump up and down and howl at the most impoverished station in how they spend money, but we will give money to that Senate, no strings attached, when we know there is absolute corruption that has gone on, and when it refuses to set any standards of accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782863">Mike Duffy received a $90,000 secret cheque from the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s chief of staff. What happened with that is fascinating, because under the Parliament of Canada Act, section 16, to offer money to a sitting senator is a crime. It is an indictable offence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782864">If we look at the ITO by Corporal Horton of the RCMP, the question that came up again and again was that this was a quid pro quo, and the quid pro quo was to whitewash the audit into Duffy's defrauding of the Canadian people. It is a very serious charge, because the people who sat on that audit committee, Senators Tkachuk, Stewart Olsen and Gerstein, were made aware, according to the RCMP, of this deal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782865">There were times in the investigation into Wallin and Brazeau when they were not even saying whether they were going to make the audit public. I find that staggering. The audit was about whether taxpayer money was used illegally to defraud people or to put favours to political senators, and that was not necessarily going to be made public from within the secretive institution known as the Senate in an attempt to whitewash it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782866">We know that when the original audit came out, there was no wrongdoing, but there was political pressure. They had to go back in and miraculously, with the same audit, found all manner of problems. Suddenly, Brazeau, Wallin and Duffy were made to walk the plank politically. This gets us back to the original problem. When we have a system that does not have accountability mechanisms, these things happen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782867">This is not to say that there not good people over in the Senate. None of them have a democratic mandate, but that is not to say that they are not fundamentally accountable to Canadians at the end of the day, even if they cannot be fired, even if they can sit there until they are 75 and even whether they show up or go off to live in Mexico and come by once a year to pick up a cheque. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782868">Senators are still fundamentally accountable to the Canadian people, but the accountability does not come from them. We have seen their refusal to establish the conflict of interest guidelines that we have. We have seen their refusal to deal with the obvious lobbying issues in terms of senators sitting on corporate boards. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="05">(1905)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3782869">That accountability mechanism must come through the House of Commons. This is our job. Whether we agree on the Senate and whether we agree on abolition, we all have a common duty here to represent the hard-working people back home. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782870">In my region of Timmins—James Bay, people are frustrated. They work really hard for what they have. I have seen more people working two jobs. I still cannot get over meeting a 68-year-old miner at the Tim Hortons in South Porcupine who told me he was going back to work underground because he could not live on his pension.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782871">The government is telling our seniors that they are going to work until they are 67 now before they can collect that pension. That is okay if they choose to do that, but, again, if they come from a region where people do really hard work and they get worn out by the time they are 65, working until they are 67 is very difficult when their CPP is a maximum of $12,000 a year if they do not have a pension. These people are paying for the largesse for the senators.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782872">There is another mechanism that we have in Parliament. We are limited in terms of our travel. There is travel for committee work and for parliamentary work. However, the limits to choose where senators go and how they go does not seem to exist within the Senate. It is like a perpetual holiday, whatever they want to study, wherever they want to go. There is always the famous story of the senators who felt they needed to go to Mexico in January to study poverty. I would invite them to Fort Albany in January, they could have seen poverty there. However, no, they were on the beaches in Mexico in January at taxpayer expense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782873">I am asking the folks back home and I am asking my colleagues in the Conservative Party this. There needs to be a wake-up call to this institution because it has shown itself fundamentally defiant in the basic nature of reform. The senators think they are going to ride out this scandal. They have thrown Mike Duffy under the bus. They have tossed Patrick Brazeau overboard. Pamela Wallin has gone for the high jump. However, they will circle the wagons on the rest of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782874">We will see, six years after Raymond Lavigne went to jail for fraud, that all the red flags that were raised about the spending mechanisms in the upper chamber will have been ignored. We can see from the Auditor General's report that all the red flags about their lack of basic controls on financial spending were ignored, which has led to this. This group of people believe it will ride this out again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782875">We can put up our hands and say that the Supreme Court told us it is not reformable, but the Supreme Court said nothing about holding it to account. The day we say that people who were chosen to sit for life above the Canadian people do not have any accountability to Canadian taxpayers would be a pretty sad day for Canada and for Canadian democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782876">I ask my hon. colleagues to think about this. I know they think this is brought forward every year and they see this as an issue that is somehow a joke to them, but I do not think it is a joke. The issue of accountability in the Senate is fundamentally an issue of representing and showing respect for people who pay the taxes for what we do here. People who are working very hard and getting very little back see the largesse that is happening in the Senate, with their credit cards, their flights. They see the fact that they are sitting on boards and doing all manner of business when they should be doing government business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782877"> To the financial issues, we can have that discussion. If senators are only working here one-third of the time, then their flights should be a lot more limited than ours. We have to go home on the weekends to represent our constituencies because our constituents expect to see us. They do not expect to see the senators. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782878">Again, now that Frank Mahovlich is retired and Roméo Dallaire is gone, let us do another Trivial Pursuit question for folks back home. How many senators can they name? Excluding the ones that are under investigation for corruption, they cannot name them because the senators do not see themselves as accountable to those folks. They are accountable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782879">Tonight, let us put this out there. We need to start this discussion. If it is not about the abolition of the Senate, if it is not about changing the term limits of the Senate, it can be about establishing some conflict of interest guidelines, establishing some rules on lobbying and establishing really clear limits on this crowd of senators, who have been blowing through taxpayer money since John A. Macdonald, so they will finally be held financially accountable to the people of Canada.</ParaText>

Could he be very clear and indicate that for us to make many of the changes the NDP has been proposing for years, it would require the support of the provinces? Surely to goodness, the member knows that. However, he still wants to give the impression that he and the NDP have the power to reform the Senate without working with the provinces in a very tangible fashion.

              <ParaText id="3782903">We have given the crowd in the so-called upper chamber 150 years to reform themselves. They refused. When the Accountability Act was brought in, they said that they were exempt from it.

They believe that they are above us.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3782911">Mr. Speaker, the issue here is regarding the votes in funding the institutions that we have in this country, such as the Senate in this particular case, and denying the funds. I questioned the member earlier about the money surrounding the support staff because that is a pertinent question. The vote we are having denies the funding of that institution. That includes not just the senators, but the support staff as well. I am not sure the member understood the gist of my question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782912">What was said about the behaviour of many of the senators, in many cases, yes, nefarious in many of these instances and I agree with his outrage in many cases. Is the Senate in a situation right now where it is becoming more accountable? Yes, it is, but we all are as parliamentarians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782913">The complaint was that some senators were out campaigning on public funds. Imagine that. That is a violation of the money that we are receiving here from taxpayers to do our jobs. We cannot take this money and go out and campaign. My hon. colleague who just spoke was in Labrador during the byelection. Perhaps he could explain to us how that was paid for. And several other members from the NDP were there. Were the flights and meals covered by the party itself? Just asking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782914">I would also like to talk about the Senate and the Supreme Court decision, but one of the things that disturbs me beyond the question that is being asked about the funding of the Senate itself is regarding the fundamental concept of the sober second thought, the original concept of the Senate way back when. I know my colleague from the NDP talked about it. It was originally set up to protect the rich. If we go to the <I>Debates</I>, yes, a lot of these upper-middle-class people comprised the Senate, but really it was about sober second thought and the binding of regions in a very large country. The regions being Ontario, Quebec, and the three Maritime provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782915"> When we started with the Constitution there had been several amendments to the Constitution pertaining to many aspects of Parliament. How do we change the Constitution in the future? My Conservative friend from Ontario earlier talked about a concept of what is contained within the Constitution Act, 1982, sections 38 to 44, which talks about how we can change the Constitution pertaining to the Senate. Do we have an elected Senate or do we have an abolished Senate? I use those two examples for very good reason.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782916">The Conservatives want to have an elected Senate. I am sorry if I am paraphrasing too much. The NDP members want to abolish the Senate, which I do not think I am paraphrasing, I think that is about it. Fundamentally what the Supreme Court said was in order to do this, according to the Constitution and the federation that we are in, we need permission of the legislatures of each of the provinces in this country, along with Parliament's okay.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782917">Earlier I talked about the NDP members getting rid of the Senate and that was not true. I was mistaken. They go way back. They talked about it from the very beginning even when they were the CCF. What I take issue with is that the concept of bringing the provinces into this conversation about getting rid of the Senate never took place. Where is the work to be done in order to abolish the Senate? I joked that for many members of the NDP it became a Twitter campaign, “let's abolish the Senate #disingenuous”, but the problem is the work was not done. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="25">(1925)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3782918">I do not know of any conversation that the federal party has had with provinces to decide how to deal with the Senate, not just abolishing it but electing it, appointing it, nine-year terms, 13-year terms, all the concepts that were upheld by the Supreme Court in its recent decision. People were shocked and said they could not believe the Supreme Court would say that all provinces were needed to abolish the Senate. I am not a constitutional lawyer and I am not surprised that is what it said. Nobody was. Yet it became a campaign in doing something that is just not possible to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782919">Let us put aside the element of sober second thought and whether this is fundamental to our country. Provinces got rid of their senates, other countries get rid of their upper chambers, that is true, but in order to have that conversation in this country, it seems to me that the two parties never opened that conversation, never opened the idea of conversing about getting rid of the Senate or electing the Senate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782920">Every now and then there would be a musing from a province about what it wanted to do. The premier of Saskatchewan wanted to abolish the Senate. Why did he say that? I do not know. Certainly the NDP never asked. He just came out with it and volunteered the information. Other provinces had the same reservations. Other provinces wanted an elected Senate, but nobody was really engaged in that conversation whatsoever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782921">Let me return to what the Supreme Court said. For fundamental changes in the Constitution, how we change the Constitution, one says that we need seven out of 10 provinces that represent over 50% of the population. Ergo, we come into the idea of an elected Senate, or a consulted one, like how the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> consults with the public. What the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> wanted to happen was to allow the provinces to run these elections. I did not see any first ministers conference by the current <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, stating, “Oh, by the way, this is what we want you to do”. Therefore, it was more of a conversation of, “We think this is a good idea, now come on you people, get on with it”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782922">When the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> talks about starting a conversation with the provinces, he does not start conversations with provinces. He starts arguments with provinces. In this case, with the NDP, it is an ignored argument. It is an ignored conversation. It is one thing if they were able to do it, if they were able to unilaterally make the changes of getting rid of the Senate and not bother talking to the provinces. That is one thing. Someone could call that being very brazen, to say the least, very arrogant, but they cannot even do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782923">For years, was it not incumbent upon a federal party such as the NDP to even ask how it could do it? We always use the expression the ends justify the means. This end was not going to happen because the means would not justify it to happen. It is almost like the Constitution did not exist. It was like an imaginary piece of paper that hung on the wall like some kind of glorified magna carta that people looked at as some kind of map and said, “This is what we used to be”. The Constitution is not what we used to be, the Constitution is what we are. It is a living, breathing document that we use to govern our country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782924">Ergo, in 1982, we received the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for that very reason. It was not just an add-on to say this is a nice thing to say, it was an add-on because the courts could use it, and we as legislators must adhere to it, which was illustrated by a few of their decisions recently, certainly in the past two years. That is why I say #disingenuous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782925">Certainly somebody in the party had to say at some point, “We can't do this”. Therefore, what do we do? Now we are going to say, “Let's make sure the Senate does not get money in order to operate”. What the hell is that going to do? Seriously. It gets to the point where it is like if we lose the game, we take our ball and go home, except we do not even go home, we just side on the sidelines and pout with ball in hand. “Fine. We are not going to give you the ball. We're going to sit here, but we're not going to give you the ball”.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3782926">Sometimes debate in this House elevates itself to a level where it becomes informative. Then there is the debate that degrades itself into becoming absolutely ridiculous. It is the theatre of the absurd. If we want to make a statement, the statement was already said by them. Again, I acknowledge the fact that it is not a recent thing for the NDP/CCF. It goes way back. However, the question was always “what” as opposed to “how”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782927">They knock our party for not having ideas on certain issues. This is the longest non-idea issue they have ever had. It absolutely is bereft of any road map, of any GPS, of anything. We are going to do this just because. I am going to take a long walk on a short wharf just because. I am not going to tell people how I am going to do it. It is just going to happen. It becomes this argument they put up every now and then based on the lowest common denominator.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782928"> They brought out the names of the people who cheated the Senate in the worst kind of way, and I agree with them that it was the worst kind of way. What happened was a dereliction of duty, to put it mildly, but it was also something that was an absolute disgrace for the Canadian taxpayer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782929">Recently there have been actions by all parties. Some people get in trouble and get ejected from caucus. That happens. It has happened recently to them. Would I disband the NDP? No. However, for some reason, they can take the lowest common denominator and extrapolate it to a solution, which is to just get rid of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782930"> They say it has no democratic value whatsoever, but actually, their idea of abolishing the Senate flies in the face of democratic values. If we abolish the Senate, a vote has to take place, not just in this legislature but also in 10 legislatures across this country. Each legislature of course has a mandate from the people. If the elected people of, say, the greatest province, Newfoundland and Labrador, bias accepted—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3782933">Mr. Speaker, let us say the people of Newfoundland and Labrador, through their elected representatives, the members of the House of Assembly, vote to keep the Senate. What would be the answer from the NDP? It would be “sorry, too bad; unilaterally we do not care about your vote”. Let us assume that they want to do a referendum. Now we are talking. If that is what they want to do, to me that is the only thing I can see the NDP doing. My question is this. Would they have a referendum across the nation, like the Charlottetown Accord? According to the Supreme Court in its recent decision, they need unanimity to get rid of the Senate, unanimity of all provinces. Therefore, they have to have a referendum in each and every province.</ParaText>

The Supreme Court, in its decision, said that there is a fundamental way to do it so that the federation is involved in the decision. The one thing that has to be done is that all the provinces have to agree to get rid of the Senate. Instead, what we got was that they could not do it, and therefore we should just give up on the argument. Let us just not bother.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3782965">Mr. Speaker, I have been following this wonderful debate, and it is a very stimulating conversation. It brings a couple of thoughts to mind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782966">One understands that Canadians are not satisfied with the Senate as it is today, but we have to deal with what we have, what we are facing, and what exists within the machinery of government. We know that the Senate has the capacity to hold hearings on bills and make amendments to bills. That will not change. That cannot change without a constitutional conference and a constitutional amendment. If it is to fulfill the role of sober second thought, one has to assume that the Senate has to have research resources at its disposal so that it can come to proper conclusions about amendments the senators want to make to bills and so on. If the research budget of the Senate is cut, how would it be possible for senators to make the most informed decisions vis-à-vis legislation?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3782967">Mr. Speaker, from the very origins of the debate about why the Senate exists, it is, as he points out, for that sober second thought. In order to provide that, and this is going to sound really bad, one has to be sober. Now, by “sober”, I mean “learned”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782968">One has to be sober and learned. What else is needed? One has to have $4,000 in property. I know that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782969">Fundamentally, he is right in the sense that the Senate does have that function of sober second thought, as prescribed by the Constitution. The fundamental principles were that it has to provide sober second thought and it also has to reflect the regions senators come from. There is a regional balance that the Senate has attained. All this is done through the monies they are given in doing that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782970">Let me just end with this. The other day, a Vancouver NDP member praised Michael Kirby for his work. Members will never guess where his work was carried out. It was the Senate. He did a report on health care in this country that was adored by all Canadians, including health practitioners and health boards. He did it in the Senate. They even praised it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3782979">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity tonight to speak to the proposal by the member for <Affiliation DbId="170429" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation> to oppose Vote No. 1—Parliament, to provide the program expenditures to the Senate in the amount of $57,532,359 in the main estimates.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782980">My remarks, I should say off the top, should in no way be confused as a ringing endorsement of the status quo in the Senate. Our government has consistently tried to reform the Senate while always recognizing the important role the Senate plays in our parliamentary system. That recognition is in direct opposition to the views of the sponsor of this motion, whose party would like to summarily abolish the institution. That is what the motion of the member for <Affiliation DbId="170429" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation> would effectively do by depriving the Senate of the resources it needs to function.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782981">Our government has always believed that while the Senate plays an important role in our parliamentary system, it needs to be improved to better serve Canadians in the way it was originally conceived.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782982">A review of our government's record since taking office in 2006 demonstrates not only our government's commitment to Senate reform but also our flexibility in accommodating different views about Senate reform.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782983">Legislation was first introduced in the 39th Parliament in April 2006 to limit Senate tenure to a period of eight years. Bill <Document DbId="2331924" Type="3">S-4</Document> at the time proposed to amend section 29 of the Constitution Act of 1867 to limit Senate tenure to a renewable term of eight years and to remove mandatory retirement at 75 years for new senators coming in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782984">Also in the 39th Parliament in 2006, our government introduced Bill <Document DbId="2590486" Type="3">C-43, the Senate appointment consultations act</Document>. That was a bill that would have provided for a national consultation process through which Canadians would be consulted on their choice of candidates for appointment to the Senate. That was obviously modelled after efforts made in my home province of Alberta, where we had undertaken any number of these consultations in the past and where we had senators who were essentially elected by the people of Alberta. It was modelled after that particular idea, the innovative approach taken by my home province of Alberta. Unfortunately, as with the term limits bill, the opposition parties refused to support these important reforms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782985">In the second session of the 39th Parliament in 2007, our government introduced Bill <Document DbId="3095159" Type="3">C-19, an act to amend the Constitution Act, 1867 (Senate tenure)</Document>, here in the House of Commons. Bill C-19 proposed to limit Senate tenure to a period of eight years, the same as the bill we introduced in the Senate a year earlier. However, there were a couple of important modifications.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782986">First, while Bill <Document DbId="2331924" Type="3">S-4</Document> did not expressly forbid the possibility of renewable terms, Bill <Document DbId="3095159" Type="3">C-19</Document> did in fact expressly provide for a non-renewable term.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782987">Second, Bill <Document DbId="3095159" Type="3">C-19</Document> contained the provision to permit a Senate term to be completed after an interruption. An example would be a term interrupted by a resignation. Despite these changes and our government's determined effort to bring change to an institution that had remained largely unchanged since 1867, the time of our Confederation, the opposition parties steadfastly refused to support our legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782988">Then, of course, our government was re-elected in 2008 with a mandate to reform the Senate, and we went to work on that. In the 40th parliament in 2009, our government introduced Bill <Document DbId="3927825" Type="3">S-7, an act to amend the Constitution Act, 1867 (Senate term limits)</Document>. It was introduced in the Senate, and it included two key changes.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="55">(1955)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3782989">The first was the idea of eight-year term limits. That limit would apply to all senators appointed after October 14, 2008, with the eight-year terms beginning from the time that the bill received royal assent. Then, of course, the retirement age of 75 years would be maintained for all senators. Once again, even this modest but important reform was opposed by the opposition parties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782990">In 2010, our government introduced Bill <Document DbId="4467885" Type="3">S-8</Document>, the senatorial selection act. It was a bill to encourage the provinces and territories to implement their own democratic processes for the selection of Senate nominees. It would have democratized the Senate and provided an opportunity for the provinces and territories to implement the processes to enable that to happen. This act included a voluntary framework that set out a basis for provinces to consult with voters on appointments to the Senate going forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782991">We all know what happened there: the opposition parties refused to support that reform too. Is anyone sensing any kind of pattern here?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782992">That year our government also reintroduced the Senate term limits bill, Bill <Document DbId="4383361" Type="3">C-10</Document>. That bill died on the order paper upon the dissolution of Parliament. Can we guess why? It was due to a lack of will for reform from the opposition parties once again. They refused to support any idea of reform in the Senate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782993">Canadians gave another mandate to our government in the election of May 2011 to again make changes to the Senate. A month and a half later, on June 21, 2011, our government introduced Bill <Document DbId="5093616" Type="3">C-7</Document>, the Senate reform act. Members can probably imagine where this is going. Bill C-7 would have implemented a nine-year non-renewable term for senators. That goes back to the point I raised earlier about being flexible and accommodating. Some concerns had been raised about the eight years, so we went for a nine-year non-renewable term.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782994">As well, that bill would have once again enabled a voluntary framework for the provinces to implement Senate appointment consultations. Processes were put in place for that. As with all the other times, the opposition parties still would not change their minds. They refused to support meaningful Senate reform.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782995">Throughout all of those debates on the Senate, time and time again our commitment to reform was crystal clear, as was our recognition of the value of the Senate in our parliamentary system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782996">Our commitment to reform was also demonstrated by a reference to the Supreme Court of Canada on Senate reform that our government launched in an effort to clarify questions about the constitutionality of legislation that we brought forward. While we were obviously disappointed by the court's decision, it is unfortunately one that all governments will have to respect going forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782997">However, the court's opinion does not in any way change our view that improvements to the Senate are needed, nor does it change our view about the value the Senate can play in our bicameral legislative system. My hope certainly remains that reform will be accomplished at some point in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782998">In the meantime, there are other ways of improving the operation of the Senate, as demonstrated by the measures that the Senate itself has initiated to improve transparency and accountability with regard to its expenses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3782999">The Senate plays a key role in the review of legislation. My Liberal colleague across the way can debate what sober second thought means, but he was right that this idea of sober second thought is a learned opinion of second thought. That is something the Senate provides, and it has resulted in improvements to legislation in the past.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="00">(2000)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3783000">The Senate also plays an important role in its committees in the investigation of issues of importance to Canadians. Certainly, the committees, as has been mentioned already in the debate this evening, have produced comprehensive reports. They have produced many, in fact, that have proven to be of tremendous value to the debate and to learning and understanding here in Parliament and throughout Canada. The Kirby report on mental health was an example of that. There was a study done by the national finance committee in the Senate on the price gap between Canada and the U.S. Again, the national finance committee looked studied the elimination of the penny. I could go on and on, citing reports that have been helpful and that have come from the Senate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783001">There is no doubt that, while the Senate is one of our key institutions here in Parliament, it has been hampered in its role by the lack of accountability that we have seen. There is no question. This lack of accountability has, in turn, been created by the lack of a democratic basis to the system of appointments. Despite the best efforts of most senators and the good work that does get done, some have questioned the legitimacy of the Senate because it lacks that democratic basis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783002">As I said earlier, I personally do not question the work of the Senate. However, clearly the events of the past year or so have fairly resulted in some damage to its reputation. While we agree about the need for improved accountability, and there is no question that it is needed, we do not believe that the solution is to remove the Senate altogether from our parliamentary system. Rather than destroy the institution and the valuable role it does and can play, we continue to believe that it can be improved and that it can continue to function as one of our key institutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783003">Clearly, the recent decision by the Supreme Court on the Senate reform reference has changed the outlook considerably on the reform front. However, improvements can still occur, and the Senate itself has been a leader in that regard over the past year. The Senate has an important role to play in making the improvements. That it has the responsibility to regulate its own affairs is the prime reason for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783004">I would draw to members' attention section 33 of the Constitution Act of 1867, which says:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783005">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left">If any Question arises respecting the Qualification of a Senator or a Vacancy in the Senate the same shall be heard...by the Senate.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783006">The Senate has made some progress in dealing with the issues it has faced in this area of financial accountability and transparency. Much of the progress has been the result of the investigations carried out by the Senate Standing Committee on Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration. As a result of that committee's recommendations, the Senate has adopted new administrative rules to render the reporting system more transparent and to tighten the requirements that senators must meet in filing their expense claims. Some senators have been required to reimburse the Senate for expenses that were considered to be improperly claimed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783007">The Senate has also asked the Auditor General to conduct an audit of Senate expenses, which will take place in the months ahead. The Senate has also acted by suspending several senators without pay or without access to Senate resources. It seems as if the Senate is taking these matters into its own hands, as it should. Our government has encouraged the Senate to address these issues, and it supports the progress that has already been made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783008">Since 2006, our government has made a number of attempts to reform the Senate, as I have outlined throughout my remarks here this evening, and as I have indicated, the opposition parties have continued to stand in our way every single time. We as a government continue to believe that providing a democratic basis for the Senate would be a vast improvement and that it would in turn improve accountability.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="05">(2005)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3783009">Our reform efforts, of course, culminated with the introduction of Bill <Document DbId="5093616" Type="3">C-7, the Senate reform act</Document>, in the last Parliament. Bill C-7 would have introduced non-renewable terms of nine years and provided for a voluntary framework, which provinces and territories could use as a basis to consult their populations on their preferences for Senate nominees, again, as I have indicated, much like what has been done in my home province of Alberta many times. It has produced some great senators, some senators with democratic legitimacy and accountability. The ideas in Bill C-7 were real and concrete measures to reform the Senate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783010">Unfortunately, our efforts to move those important reforms forward came to an end with the release of the Supreme Court's decision on the Senate reform reference. The fact that in that reference we included a question on abolition was not in any way an indication that our government favoured abolition as an instrument. Our first choice has always been the introduction of reforms that would enhance the Senate's democratic legitimacy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783011">The Senate certainly has an important role to play in our system. I believe that abolition would remove an important player in the parliamentary system and would leave a huge hole in the legislative process, and for no good reason. Those who know even a little about our system of government, just a bit, know that the Senate has an important role to play in our system, despite what opposition parties may have tried to claim. The Senate's role in the legislative review process is invaluable to our system. We need to continue to provide the Senate with the resources it needs to function effectively.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783012">Of course, we expect the Senate to treat those funds with respect. There have been a number of rule changes designed to ensure that is what is happening. However, we cannot simply remove the entire allocation to the Senate. As I said, we have brought forward a number of suggestions and bills, both in the Senate and in this place, seeking to provide the reform, to create the democratic legitimacy, and to create the accountability that we believe is necessary in the Senate. As I have said, every single time, time and time again, those measures and those attempts to make the reform were blocked by the opposition parties. They would not support anything we tried to do in terms of reform. We brought forward a number of different proposals. We were willing to be flexible, we were willing to be accommodating, we tried different approaches, and we did everything we could to see that reform come to fruition, but the opposition parties refused to allow reform to happen, every single time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783013">As I have indicated, we understand that there have been some issues with regard to expenses and whatnot in the Senate over the last year or so. There is a need to address those issues and create better accountability. As I have said tonight, there have certainly been efforts undertaken in the Senate itself to try to accomplish those things, and we continue to encourage and support that. We know that reform is something that needs to happen some time in the future. Hopefully, we will get some recognition of that from the opposition parties at some point in time. We can keep trying and hoping, but what we cannot do is simply remove the entire allocation from the Senate and pretend it never existed, and that is what is being proposed here tonight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783014">I cannot support the proposal by the member for <Affiliation DbId="170429" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation> to oppose this allocation of the resources to the Senate, which is clearly a thinly disguised attempt to abolish an institution that fills an important function in our legislative process.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3783022">Mr. Speaker, I find it unfortunate that the member chose to very selectively listen to the comments I made. I made a number of comments, and what I did was very clearly lay out exactly what has transpired since our government has taken office. We have always believed there is a need to reform the Senate. We believe it has an important role to play in Parliament, but there does need to be reform in the Senate. I have outlined throughout my remarks this evening all of the attempts we have made to try to create that reform, to create a democratic process that is a voluntary one for the provinces and territories to be able to choose their senators.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783023">We have made attempts to put in term limits and there were a variety of reforms, but guess what? We have been unable to make those changes because the opposition parties have failed to support any of those changes. It is unfortunate that the member stands and tries to cast aspersions on our idea of reforming the Senate and how important we believe that reform is, because members opposite have blocked every single attempt we made to try to create those reforms. The fault lies squarely over there.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3783024">Mr. Speaker, actually the member is wrong. It is not because the NDP does not support the Conservative government's reforms; it is because the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has failed to understand that in order to have the types of reforms the member is talking about, unfortunately from the Prime Minister's perspective, that obligates him to work with the provinces. He would have to get the provinces onside. The Prime Minister can stand on his pedestal and say whatever he wants, but until he recognizes that he needs to meet with all of the premiers and get them onside and maybe even do some consultation with Canadians, his position is not that much more tangible that what the NDP members are proposing to do.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3783026">Mr. Speaker, I find it highly rich to hear a Liberal member stand in the House of Commons and talk about Senate reform. His leader's contribution to the idea of reforming the Senate is to take all the Liberal senators and turn them into Senate Liberals in some kind of publicity stunt. That is all it really was. Then on top of that, the member's idea to try to further reform the Senate going forward is to appoint people to appoint the senators. That seems a lot more democratic. I am sure that would make the Senate far more democratic. If his leader were to appoint some people who would then appoint senators, I think that would make it much more democratic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783027">I think it should be made clear that the sarcasm was evident in those comments. I do not know if the member thinks, like his colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170172" Type="2">Scarborough—Guildwood</Affiliation>, that it was a bozo eruption from his leader or if that was a legitimate proposal, but certainly appointing people to appoint senators would not do anything to create more democratic legitimacy in the Senate; that is for sure.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3783030">If I understand the form and substance of the motion correctly, the NDP is asking us to shut down the House of legislation, which would allow bills, such as the one proposed by the member for <Affiliation DbId="170184" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> that passed this House, to stall and completely shut down the entire legislative process in this country.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3783042">Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to speak to the main estimates this evening and specifically to the Senate appropriations. Before I go into more detail about the subject at hand, I have to say that I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="170131" Type="2">Brome—Missisquoi</Affiliation>, an outstanding member whose riding is near Sherbrooke.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783043">My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170184" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> already mentioned one of the important points I wanted to raise: the difference between voted and statutory appropriations. Both Conservative and Liberal members have a hard time telling the difference between the two. There is a fundamental difference between appropriations voted here in the House and statutory appropriations. As my colleague said, the government allocates $58 million for voted appropriations—I rounded the number, obviously—and $34 million for statutory appropriations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783044">I just wanted to set the record straight before getting started. The few people who spoke before me seemed to have a hard time telling the difference between these two kinds of appropriations, a difference that is nevertheless very clear when we look at the voting process for appropriations in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783045">The Senate will cost $92.5 million, which is more than in past years. The main estimates list the previous year's spending and the forecast spending. From 2012-13 to 2013-14, Senate spending increased by about $3.8 million, or nearly $4 million. In contrast to all of the government departments and agencies that are tightening their belts at the behest of the Conservative government, the Senate has been increasing its budget year after year. The Treasury Board is asking all government departments and agencies to cut spending, but the Senate is making no effort to spend less. It is a shame that the Senate is once again taking advantage of this money to make expenditures that could be described as hard to justify. Later on, I can comment further on everything that has been going on in the Senate recently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783046">Before I begin, I would like to put some numbers in perspective. What does $92.5 million represent? It represents the taxes paid by 8,000 families who are footing the bill for the Senate. Another significant fact I would like to point out is that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> promised he would not appoint any unelected senators. That was back in March 2004. How many senators have been appointed since then? More than 57. If my math is right, the total is now 60.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783047">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> also said that an appointed Senate is a relic of the 19th century. However, senators are still being appointed. As I said, the Prime Minister appoints senators every year. It is interesting to look at who is being appointed. A former campaign strategist, a former president of the Conservative Party, party fundraisers and failed Conservative candidates have all been appointed. There are very recent examples of this, dating back to just 2011. Conservative candidates who did not win the election were then appointed to the Senate. That is quite the gift. It seems that Conservative candidates who lose an election can get a gift from the Prime Minister and be appointed to the Senate, where they can remain until they are 75 and pocket all the money that comes with that, obviously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783048">Meanwhile, the third party and the government are trying to sell us nice ideas about how the Senate is a place for sober thought and reflection. I believe the Supreme Court ruling referred to a chamber of “sober second thought”.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="25">(2025)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3783049">For the last little while, members have been trying to convince us that the Senate engages in sober second thought, when most of the senators, who have been appointed by either a Liberal or a Conservative prime minister, are people who have close ties with the party and obey their prime minister. That is therefore not true. No one can convince me this evening that the Senate is a chamber of sober second thought. I think those are the words the Supreme Court used. In reality, senators are controlled by the Prime Minister's Office, whether the prime minister is Liberal or Conservative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783050">Here is another interesting statistic about appointed senators. To whom are they accountable? I do not think they are accountable to the public. In fact, 51 of the 57 senators appointed by the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> made donations to the Conservative Party. I would like to believe that this is just a coincidence, but I have my doubts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783051">This brings me to the topic of the people to whom senators are accountable once they are appointed and they arrive in the other chamber, where they can remain until they are 75. To whom are they accountable? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783052">It is a valid question. We may ask to whom they are accountable if, for example, a senator is involved in misconduct, has acted badly or has incurred inappropriate expenses. I do not think I have to go on at length about senators' expenses. Everyone watching at home knows what I am talking about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783053">Senators are paid by taxpayers, and it takes 8,000 Canadian families to pay the Senate's bills. To whom are senators accountable, then? They are accountable only to the prime minister who appointed them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783054">That really is true. In theory, one could argue that it is not the case, that they are free to think and act as they want and that they are not accountable to the prime minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783055">However, in fact, senators are accountable to the Prime Minister's Office only. We saw that during the Senate scandal. The Prime Minister's Office exercises immense control over the senators, including the leader of the Senate, who, if I am not mistaken, meets regularly with the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. We have also seen how certain tactics that were used in the upper house were directly linked to instructions from the Prime Minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783056">Do not try to convince me that the Senate is a chamber of sober second thought. Only one person controls it all: the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the people in his office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783057">Do not try to tell me I should believe the Conservatives, either, when they talk of reforming the Senate. They have been promising to reform it for more than 10 years. The hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170554" Type="2">Wild Rose</Affiliation> said that it was the opposition's fault that the matter has been dragging on for 10 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783058">The only person to blame is the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, because, in his vision of Senate reform, his only intention was to avoid talking to the provinces. The only thing in his mind was to get his reform through without having to talk to the provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783059">As a result, the only person to blame if there has been no Senate reform for 10 years is the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. He promised reform, though. He never wanted to consult the provinces. He always wanted to do it all by himself without ever consulting, and the Supreme Court told him that things do not work that way.</ParaText>

Why are we paying $90 million per year for an institution made up of unelected members who are accountable to nobody?</ParaText>

Senators are completely unaccountable. They represent only the party that appointed them. They do not represent their regions or even the Canadian people.</ParaText>

That bill would have reduced greenhouse gas emissions to below 1990 levels. That was a much more ambitious target than the one the government announced at the Copenhagen summit. The bill was passed by elected representatives in the House of Commons and killed by the Senate.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3783091">We are not the only ones who want to abolish it. Manitoba and Quebec got rid of their senates many years ago. Their unicameral legislatures work just fine.

I remind members that Saskatchewan has a Conservative premier.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3783094">The Liberals voted against this motion. Then, in the fall, we moved a motion to make the Senate more accountable to Canadians. The NDP was optimistic that the old parties would reassess how they use the Senate and support our motion. Our measures would have prevented senators from participating in partisan activities and using taxpayers' money to participate in activities that are not directly related to their parliamentary work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783095">The outcome of the vote on that motion shows that they are all talk and that transparency and accountability are not really that important to them. It was particularly disappointing to see the Liberals join forces with the Conservatives to defeat this motion. The Conservatives and the Liberals keep swearing that they really want to change things, but as I said, they vote for the status quo at every opportunity.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3783110">Mr. Speaker, normally I am happy to have the opportunity to participate in a debate, but not today. Today, in this case, I will be rising to oppose a motion denying the allocation of resources for the Senate. In other words, I will not be supporting the motion that opposes funding for the Senate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783111">I expect that was the point by the member opposite in creating this motion, because the member knows the role of the Senate in our Constitution. Once a bill leaves this place, it must pass through the other place before it ultimately can receive royal assent. In essence, the member opposite is suggesting to shut down the ability to pass laws, to amend laws and to change legislation, because without the Senate, the way our Constitution is structured, that would be the final result.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783112">I suppose that a do nothing approach is favourable to the NDP. After all, if nothing were to change, the New Democratic Party would not have to oppose everything. I have problems with that, and I would like to provide an example for the chamber as to why that is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783113">Recently, in this place, we debated Bill <Document DbId="6365510" Type="3">C-17</Document>, otherwise known as Vanessa's law, a long overdue, much needed bill that would better protect Canadians from dangerous drugs by ensuring that our democratically elected <Affiliation DbId="194628" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> and Health Canada could have the power to recall dangerous drugs and not just the huge pharmaceutical corporations, as is the current case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783114">One of my weekly member of Parliament reports was focused on Vanessa's law. I am pleased to share with the House that the response from my constituents was overwhelmingly in support of the bill. Even my local NDP and Liberal friends were strongly supportive of the bill. Yet, as we know, the NDP in the House supported Vanessa's law as well, even if they filibustered the debate in debating how they agreed with it. I suspect when the New Democrats heard from their constituents back home, they heard much the same message that I heard. That is likely why they did an about-face in sending that bill forward late last week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783115"> Imagine if bills like Vanessa's law could not ultimately become law because they could not pass through the other place. This is the kind of nonsense the NDP is proposing in this motion today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783116">I am not naive to the fact that there are many Canadians who are strongly opposed to the Senate. The problem is that the NDP likes to pretend that it has a magic wand and can simply wish the Senate away. Our own Supreme Court has confirmed that simply is not the case. The NDP knows this and yet it continues to play a political game that we can simply make the Senate disappear when, in fact, we cannot.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783117">If the NDP truly wants a constitutional debate on the Senate, it should simply say so. Let us be clear that there are many non-partisan support staff that make that Senate run, no different than the assistance we here receive and benefit from in this place. The NDP members, with this motion, in effect, is suggesting that none of them get paid, or perhaps they are suggesting that they possibly work for free. Is the member for <Affiliation DbId="170429" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation> also proposing to hand out pink slips to all the support staff in the Senate?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783118">If there were lawsuits from de-funding the Senate, would the member for <Affiliation DbId="170429" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation> ask his friends in the union movement to cover the costs of those lawsuits, as he did his own? I suspect not. This is the same NDP that has no problem using tax dollars in NDP satellite offices, the same NDP that is happy to use taxpayer-funded staff in these satellite offices, but apparently does not think there should be taxpayer-funded staff in the Senate. This just does not reconcile.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3783119">The Canadian Senate, rightly or wrongly, was conceived as an institution to provide sober second thought in legislative scrutiny. It was also conceived as an institution to provide regional representation, as evidenced by the regional divisions of the Senate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783120">Disagreement with the Senate is nothing new to Canadians and, I would suggest, has been occurring since July 1, 1867, and has continued ever since. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783121">As I am sure all members are well aware, a plethora of Senate reform proposals have been put forward over a number of decades. In most cases, proposals have called for an injection of democratic legitimacy into the appointment process, as well as the changes to the distribution of senators among the provinces, and also changes to the power of the Senate itself. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783122">One of these reform initiatives was the triple-E Senate proposal that came out of Alberta during the 1980s. Triple-E stands for elected, equal and effective. This should not be confused with the Liberal leader's vision of a triple-E Senate, which is a Senate of the elites, by the elites and for the elites. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783123">The original triple-E proposal laid the basis for many of the proposals that ensued in the years that followed and found its way into constitutional discussions that took place during the 1980s and 1990s, the most notable being the Meech Lake constitutional accord and the Charlottetown constitutional accord. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783124">The Charlottetown accord would have resulted in a fundamentally changed Senate. The Senate would have been elected with an equal number of senators per province, with some limitations on the power of the Senate to avoid deadlock. The rejection of the Charlottetown accord in the 1992 referendum significantly reduced the prospects for fundamental constitutional reform for many years, and serious discussion of the Senate largely disappeared from the national debate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783125">As members will know, not long after the 2006 election, when our government first introduced Bill S-4 in the Senate, the bill would have limited senators' tenure to a renewable term of eight years. Bill S-4 gathered a great deal of support and was endorsed by the Senate Special Committee on Senate Reform, as well as by a number of constitutional experts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783126">Let us not forget that it was the opposition parties that united in their refusal to support meaningful Senate reform, as was proposed in Bill S-4. This led to the introduction of Bill C-7, the Senate reform act, in 2011. Bill C-7 would have implemented a nine year, non-renewable term for senators, as well as a voluntary framework for provinces to implement Senate appointment consultation processes of their own. However, that was not to be, and now we must all live with and respect the decision of the Supreme Court in this matter. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783127">The court said that Senate abolition would require the support of Parliament and the legislative assemblies of each province. In doing so, it has given the Senate the highest level of protection that can be achieved under our amending procedures. I would point out for the member for Winnipeg Centre that his proposal to effectively abolish the Senate by withdrawing its funding would not conform to the court's decision in its Senate reform reference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783128">I would also like to point out that it is unlikely that all of the provinces agree with the position of the member for <Affiliation DbId="170429" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation>. I would further submit that one thing most of the provinces do appear to agree on is that the Senate is not the top priority of provincial concern. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783129">I would like to make this clear. I am not looking to defend the institution that we call the other place. That is not the role of members of the House. However, we now have a reference to the Supreme Court of Canada on Senate reform and the release of the court's opinion this spring. It remains to be seen what the ultimate impact of the court's opinion will be on the future for reform.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783130"> However, the subject of this potential constitutional debate is not one that any member of this place should take lightly. The reality is that the member for <Affiliation DbId="170429" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation> is trying to do an end run around with his motion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783131">I understand the NDP's frustration, and at times I am certain we all wish we had a magic wand to make our challenges magically go away. However, what the member for <Affiliation DbId="170429" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation> has proposed, as we know, is not how this issue will be resolved. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3783132">Before I close, I would like to share a few personal thoughts on this issue. Since I have come to this place, I have worked with senators. I have worked with senators on the Senate-House of Commons Standing Joint Committee for the Scrutiny of Regulations. I worked with the Senate on the passage of my private member's bill on the interprovincial movement of wine. This work seldom is covered by the media. However, I can state first-hand that it is important work and that the Senate takes a different perspective on these issues. I mention this because we all know that there are a handful of members from the other place who have become household names for a variety of different but not flattering reasons. However, there are also many good people who do good work on behalf of Canadians in the other place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783133">Many of us may not like the historic structure of the other place and the role it plays in our governance. However, dislike of an institution we disagree with does not alleviate our constitutional obligations to work with that institution. Regardless of what the NDP thinks, the Senate is part of the process of how we pass laws.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783134">I need not remind the NDP that we are legislators. To deny or otherwise disable part of the very process involved with changing legislation would in effect compromise the work we do on behalf of Canadians. If the NDP seeks to disable our ability to pass, amend, or change laws as legislators, then perhaps it is time it ceased to be the opposition. I frequently hear the NDP members propose private member's bills, suggest amendments, and even propose to change laws, should they ever form the government. None of that can happen without bills passing through the Senate. It is in our constitution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783135"> Either the New Democratic Party is kidding Canadians, or perhaps it is just kidding itself. Either way, like the Senate or not, those who came long before us did a very good job of ensuring that the other place is very much part of how we pass bills into law. To undermine this process undermines the work we do as legislators, and I cannot and will not support this motion presented by the NDP tonight. I certainly will be happy to vote in favour of the estimates put forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783136">I support the motion put forward by the government so that it can have supply, but I stand opposed to the notion by the NDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783137">I would like to thank all members of the House for taking the time to hear my comments this evening. I appreciate and look forward to their questions.</ParaText>

There is a reason why every time I have spoken in this House on issues concerning the Senate I have referred to it as institutional arthritis, because that is essentially what the Senate is at this point.</ParaText>

One of the toughest parts is that we all come here with notions about how things should be and how we would change things, but then we find out that not everyone in this place agrees with us. Therefore, we have to have a process to deal with the issues of the day. Our constitution says, and the Supreme Court backs it up, that we have two houses for a reason. Despite perhaps an individual member's wishes, we need to acknowledge that it is part of our constitution, that it is part of the lawful process we are here to do, and that we need to take ideas, translate them into bills, debate those issues, and see those things come forward by getting enough people to say yes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783142">My bill on the interprovincial shipment of wine started back in 1928 as a prohibition era idea that many of us here opposed.

However, I have to say that when it comes to the issue of the Senate, certainly the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was very vocal about his concern about change in the Senate. Yet after eight years of Conservative rule, the government has brought no changes at all to the Senate. It was our leader, actually, who made more significant change in one morning in the Senate than we have seen from the Prime Minister himself, other than appointing 54 senators since he came to office.</ParaText>

They will call themselves Senate Liberals. The Liberals basically said that they were going to have free elections for their own leadership, their whip position, and the House leader, and it was the same individuals. Of the change she speaks of, I do not know what she actually means, because as far as I can see, that is just more talk.</ParaText>

This Prime Minister in this place said during question period a week or two after the ruling from the Supreme Court came out that if the provinces have ideas on whether the Senate should be reformed or whether it should be abolished, to carry those motions forward forthwith.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783148">While the member may be content with the ideas her leader has put forward, the fact that he did not even consult with his own caucus before ejecting them seems to say more about how his approach to reforming his own party is all talk, and in fact, no consultation.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3783160">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise for a very few moments to debate this particular motion. I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170315" Type="2">Nanaimo—Cowichan</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783161">I am pleased to wade in here to have this discussion. The motion that is before us is about the estimates, and it is about the Senate. The mover of the motion, our first speaker, talked about the whole question of accountability and approving a line item of $92 million to the Senate, where there is no accountability for how that money will be spent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783162">In reality, and let me clarify this, members on both the government side and the Liberal benches have been extraordinarily upset that we are going to cut off all the money to Senate, which will not be able to operate anymore and some of the staff may be laid off. They have been very concerned about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783163">Let me assure members that what we are talking about is the discretionary part of that particular budget line, which is nearly $58 million, and the $34 million, nearly $35 million represents statutory forecasts, in other words the amount of money that has been deemed necessary to keep the lights on and the staff working, and so on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783164">I know that members opposite and adjacent have been very upset by the fact that we may be proposing to vote on a motion that would lay staff off. I would love to hear what working people across this country think about the faux concern that they have heard tonight from government members and Liberal members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783165">That is the first point, the concern that we would cut off money and that the Senate would not be able to operate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783166">The second concern, of course, is that if we close the doors to the Senate, then we would not be able to do anything. We would not be able to pass any legislation. We would not be able to do any business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783167">It used to be the case in this country that 10 provinces had a Senate or two Houses. They got rid of them, and they still operate. The provinces still do business. My province of Nova Scotia got rid of its Senate in 1928, and it is still working. It is still governing. It is still doing business. It is still passing legislation. It is still raising taxes and still spending money on behalf of the people who have elected the Senate members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783168">Let us be clear, I understand what the nub of the problem is here. The Liberals and the Conservatives have had this other institution over there that they have stuffed chockablock full of partisans for 150 years, who have gone across this country from coast to coast to coast on the taxpayers' dime performing partisan activities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783169">It is not that some of them have not done good work or that some of these committees have not done some good work from time to time, when they have been able to find time, when there are no elections or fundraising events or snowstorms in P.E.I. or something of the like happening. They have done some work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783170">It is not about the individuals, and that is what gets confusing sometimes. It is about a few of them. It is about the ones who seem to use the money they get, the allowances, and the credit cards they get, as if it is their own money to do with what they will, before they finally get caught. It is those ones who end up getting chased around by the authorities, the police, and others. That is a bit personal. Those are the people we are talking about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783171">We are saying to the government and to the Liberals that we can hold the Senate accountable. That is what this motion is all about. It is about accountability.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="15">(2115)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3783172">Why do we not, as a group, stand up, suck it up a little bit, and start playing hardball with the Senate, start demanding some accountability? The government has not been able to do it in the 10 years it has been proposing to make the Senate accountable. It has not been able to do anything. Let us agree tonight, all of us here in this chamber, to do it once and for all. We will defeat this motion so that all of a sudden, tomorrow morning, the senators will realize they will not get $57 million until they start coming up with some accountability measures that have teeth and that Canadians can trust, and most important, members in this House who are responsible for paying those bills will have some confidence that once and for all, the activities that go on in that chamber will be held accountable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783173">We will get to the other part. Members suggest that it is impossible to actually deal with Senate reform or abolishment, but it is not. Canadians are ready for it. Provinces are ready for it. We hear about it wherever we go in the country. People are fed up with the fact that we have a chamber where men and women have been appointed simply because of the favours they did for a particular prime minister or for the water cans they carry for a political party. That is not good enough. Canadians are demanding more. They are demanding more because the government and the former government have been asking Canadians to tighten their belts and to do with less.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783174">I talked to a woman today in Dartmouth who is having a hard time finding housing for her and her two children because of the cuts the government has made in the availability of affordable housing across this country. We have tried, my colleagues on this side have tried to force the government to bring forward a national housing strategy, to no avail. The woman, on behalf of her children, wants to see us holding the Senate accountable for at least $57 million of the $92 million that we are supposed to approve tonight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783175">A number of people have been in my office in the past two months who have had to wait upwards of 40 days to get their claims paid through EI. They have asked me why it is that the Senate, which is unelected and unaccountable, can be allowed to spend $92 million without any explanation, without being held accountable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783176">I am here to say, and my colleagues are suggesting in their debate and in their support for this motion today, that we have the opportunity to hold this institution accountable tonight, right here, on behalf of my constituents, on behalf of Canadians across the country who are asking us to be accountable for the money that we allocate. We have the opportunity to do that today. Let us do it today. Let us vote to hold the Senate accountable and then let us move on to get rid of the Senate, because we can operate. Canadians are asking us to make sure that the decisions that are made by the Government of Canada in fact are accountable and are made by people who are duly elected.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3783185">Recently this year there has been a very strict accountability of the finances, a very close examination of the Senate. We know the Senate has a long and wonderful history where it is known as the chamber of sober second thought. We know that there are a lot of wonderful senators who work extremely hard and play within the rules. Since some of this has happened in the Senate and it has been revealed that some individuals allegedly have misused funds, this very strong accountability of the money has been put in place.

              <ParaText id="3783190">It is all about accountability, and as I listened to the various comments, questions, and speeches, I have found it interesting that by and large members other than the NDP have not wanted to talk about the issues of accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783191">I was fortunate to be elected back in 2004, so I have been in this august place for 10 years now, but we so rarely get an opportunity in this House to discuss the issues around accountability in the Senate. There is simply very little mechanism for us to do this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783192">I want to applaud the member for <Affiliation DbId="170429" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation> for consistently raising this issue year after year. He has been tireless in attempting to get this place to talk about accountability issues with the Senate. It is tonight that we get this very brief period of time to shine the light on the lack of accountability in the Senate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783193">I was interested to hear the member opposite ask the question about the very strict accountability that was put in place in December. We eagerly await, at least on this side of the House, the Auditor General's report on expenditures in the Senate. We eagerly await that detail and the recommendations for the kinds of measures that need to be put in place to ensure accountability in the Senate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783194">The other issue that has come up consistently this evening is the fact that people are talking about the Supreme Court decision and the fact that the government proposal in its piece of legislation was not deemed as meeting the requirements under the Constitution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783195"> Certainly, I do not think any of us here is questioning the wisdom of the Supreme Court position with regard to reform of the Senate. However, there are still other mechanisms that we could put forward to talk about making the Senate more accountable. The NDP has certainly made some recommendations about the reformation of the Senate that do not require constitutional change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783196">The member for <Affiliation DbId="170184" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> mentioned that one of the things we could do is prohibit the senators from taxpayer-funded partisan work. The senators would no longer participate in party caucuses or do fundraising, organizing, or public advocacy on behalf of a political party, using Senate resources. That seems like a really good plan. We do not require the provinces' consent to make that particular reform. In fact, the leaders of the Conservative and Liberal parties, who are the only parties here who have Senate appointments, could actually work with their senators right now to institute that policy this very minute.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783197">Second, we could end taxpayer-sponsored travel that is not directly related to senators' legislative work. This sounds like a reasonable accountability measure. Certainly here in the House we have rigorous reporting requirements in terms of how we report our expenses with regard to flights: what we were doing, where we were going. There is no reason why the Senate cannot have that same kind of rigorous approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783198">Third, we could establish a single ethics code and a single ethics commissioner for all parliamentarians. Again, that would make absolutely perfect sense. I mean, there are standards that parliamentarians in the House of Commons have. We have to fill out detailed forms with regard to other activities we may be engaged in. The Ethics Commissioner reviews the forms to ensure we are fulfilling our requirements and responsibilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783199"> We have seen very rare occasions, fortunately, in this House where members of the government have had to stand up and apologize because their conflict of interest form perhaps did not reveal the details that were required. However, again, we have a rigorous process here, and members by and large abide by that process. It would seem a good process to put in place with regard to the Senate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783200">I have heard talk about the sober second thought. If only that were true. Since 2011, there have been very few bills that have been amended in the Senate. Where bills have been amended in the Senate, it was because the government gave it marching orders. It was because the government blew something on a bill and then told the Senate what amendments it had to do because they were required. However, in terms of independent review of legislation, that sober second thought that people keep talking about simply has not happened. We have a Senate that is heavily stacked on a partisan basis, and that is the kind of review that is brought to those pieces of legislation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="25">(2125)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3783201">We have had unprecedented numbers of bills originating in the Senate. One would think, if the government thought they were that important, it would actually draft the bills and have them tabled in the House of Commons and then referred to the Senate. However, we are not seeing that kind of approach to a legislative agenda.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783202">Others have pointed this out, but I was fortunate enough to be a member of the House when the climate change accountability legislation was passed in the House of Commons and then referred to the Senate. With some trickery and chicanery in the Senate, it was defeated. It makes no sense to me that we have the duly elected representatives debating and determining a piece of legislation that we feel is in the best of interest of Canadians, we send it off to the Senate, and it is summarily defeated. That does not seem a reasonable approach for an unaccountable, unelected Senate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783203">I want to turn to the scandals that have been plaguing the Senate over the last several months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783204">Again, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170644" Type="2">Dartmouth—Cole Harbour</Affiliation> pointed this out. I know from talking to my constituents and other Canadians that people are raising concerns about the Senate, about how money is spent in the Senate, how accountable it is, why it is that the Senate continues to operate in this fashion, and why somebody is not doing something about it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783205">New Democrats are. We are trying to actually highlight the fact that there is a significant amount of money—in fact, the total amount is $91.5 million, but the amount we are talking about tonight is $57.5 million—which is the part that requires approval of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783206">Canadians are asking why. Why are we continuing to spend this money when there are so many other pressing issues facing Canadians? Why does the Senate continue to be funded for a job that it clearly does not do? It rubber-stamps legislation for the government, so why is it continuing to be funded for that?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783207">I want to turn to consultation for a moment. I have been lucky enough to sit here and listen to a number of comments and questions, so I heard the government and the third party ask us a number of times what we did to consult. I have to remind members of this House that the responsibility around consultation rests with the government. It is the one that develops legislation. It is the one that develops policy. It rests with the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783208">The Supreme Court decision said that, in order to do that constitutional reform, we need to have the consent of provinces. We do have a long history of Reformers and now Conservatives talking about the need for Senate reform. If they acknowledge that there is that need for Senate reform and they saw what the Supreme Court said, what exactly have they done to move this conversation along?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783209">Again, I want to remind people that it is the government's responsibility to take part in consultation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783210">I would argue that members in this House, whenever they put forward a private member's bill or a motion, do not engage in the extensive kind of consultation that is required with regard to government legislation. I am the aboriginal affairs critic and we do not even see the government doing appropriate consultation with respect to aboriginal issues. It hardly seems likely that it is going to conduct the kind of consultation required around constitutional change with respect to the Senate.</ParaText>

That is just one example of where similar kinds of money that should have gone to support the workers and their families in this country have just been removed from government coffers by arbitrary decisions, because of governments that could not balance their budgets any other way except on the backs of workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783213"> I certainly would like to talk about what $57 million would do for schools on reserve, what $57 million would do for clean drinking water on reserve, what $57 million would do for housing, what it would do for child welfare, and what it would do to implement Jordan's principle. There are many ways that this $57.5 million could be used to actually make lives better for all Canadians instead of for a few senators who are party hacks.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3783215">Mr. Speaker, when I think of the proposal that the NDP has put forward, I recognize that it would have a very profound impact on the operations of the Senate. I am sure that, as any responsible official opposition would, the NDP has actually gone out and canvassed the opinions of different provinces, because as the Supreme Court has clearly indicated, the provinces do have a legal right to participate in what is taking place, to a certain degree, with the operations of our Senate. That would be in both the federal and provincial jurisdictions. Some might have different viewpoints.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783216">I wonder if the member could give any indication whatsoever as to whether the NDP has, in fact, canvassed any of the provincial jurisdictions.

              <ParaText id="3783220">Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for her very eloquent speech. She has really shed a lot of light on the nature of the debate today. It is about whether this House agrees to continue to fund the Senate in Canada to the tune of $92 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783221">I come from a province, Ontario, that also used to have a Senate. It abolished it many years ago, as did a number of other provinces and as have many other countries in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783222">When we meet people from other countries and talk about the Canadian Senate, they think of a senator as someone who has been elected and who is democratically accountable to the electorate. They do not fully understand that, in fact, many of those who are in the Senate are failed candidates from the governing party, people who have been fundraisers, loyal campaigners, and so on. They are basically partisans who have been put in the Senate as some kind of reward. As a quid pro quo, they often continue to work on behalf of their political party.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3783227">We need to be clear on what we are talking about tonight, what the substance of the debate is. It is my understanding that my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170429" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation> gave notice of opposition to Vote 1 in the estimates, which is an amount of approximately $57 million under “The Senate—Program expenditures, in the Main Estimates for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2015”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783228">What does this mean? It means that this amount is part of the amount that the Senate uses to conduct its operations. There has been a lot of important debate tonight about changes in the Senate, about how we could reform the Senate, about how the Senate could act in a more transparent manner or be more accountable to Canadians. These are important, weighty issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783229">I have certainly been quoted in the media. My opinions about the need for Senate reform are on the public record. When I go out to talk to my constituents, it is an issue. How do we make the folks who are responsible for legislation in this country more accountable to Canadians? There are several senators who would agree that this body should be made more accountable. This is a topic of debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783230">Going back to what we are talking about tonight, it is the allocation for this upcoming fiscal year for the operations of the Senate.

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The lawmaking process starts with a bill — a proposal to create a new law, or to change an existing one. Most of the bills considered by Parliament are public bills, meaning they concern matters of public policy such as taxes and spending, health and other social programs, defence and the environment.</QuotePara>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">A bill can be introduced in the House of Commons (C-bills) or the Senate (S-bills), but most public bills get their start in the Commons. A bill goes through certain formal stages in each house. These stages include a series of three readings during which parliamentarians debate the bill. Prior to third and final reading, each house also sends the bill to a committee where members examine the fine points of the legislation. Committee members listen to witnesses give their opinions on the bill, and then subject it to clause-by-clause study based on the testimony.</QuotePara>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Either house can do four things with a bill: pass it; amend it; delay it; or defeat it. Sometimes, one house refuses changes or amendments made by the other, but they usually both agree eventually.</QuotePara>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">All laws of Canada are formally enacted by the Sovereign, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and the House of Commons. Once both houses have approved a bill, it is presented for Royal Assent and becomes law.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783232">Just to recap, how does a bill become law? It passes through the first House—sometimes the Senate, but usually the House of Commons—and it passes through the second House—usually the Senate, but sometimes the House of Commons—and then royal assent is given by the Governor General.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783233">How does it pass through a House? It goes through first reading, when the bill proposing a law is received and circulated. At second reading, the principle of the bill is debated to verify that the bill represents good policy, et cetera. Then it goes through committee stage. Members of the public appear as witnesses to comment. At report stage, the committee report is considered by the whole House. Third reading is final approval of the bill, and the bill is either sent back to the other House or set aside for royal assent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783234">As a recap on how the legislative process works here, right now, for this fiscal year, we require both Houses in order to pass legislation. I actually do not think anyone here can argue that, and if they do, they need to have a refresher course prior to continuing their activities in the House. We need to have both sides under our Constitution right now.</ParaText>

I believe the bill is coming up for debate shortly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783241">The bill will be debated here at second reading stage and will go to committee. Many of the stakeholders that my colleague has consulted on the bill will provide their input at committee stage. I hope that we have great debate on this particular bill.

              <ParaText id="3783242">If we go back to what I just went through, which is publicly available and part of any civics lesson, the bill will go to the Senate for the next stage of review, and then royal assent.

              <ParaText id="3783243">Not putting this vote forward in the estimates means that the NDP is voting to shut down the legislative process in this country. It is as simple as that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783244">We can have an extensive debate on Senate reform and how senators should be elected and so on, but that is not the subject of the debate tonight. The NDP has proposed to shut down the legislative process in Canada. For all of the democratic woe is us, for all of the democracy in Canada is this and that and what not, we have before us a suggestion to shut down the legislative process in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783245">We are late in the session. Many of us want to be in our ridings connecting with our constituents. We should all give pause for thought as to what that means. It means that if legislation from the House cannot be passed, then it cannot be enacted. It means that next year, the routine process of government that goes through the Senate would not happen. Whether one agrees with Senate reform or abolition or however a member thinks we should seek to change it, the reality remains that not voting this particular piece forward means we cannot put government legislation through.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783246">I have been listening to the questions and answers tonight. We have had a lively debate on how we could possibly make the Senate more accountable to Canadians; that is subject matter worthy of debate, but it is not the substance of what is being debated right now. Sometimes we lose sight of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783247">I would ask my colleagues across the way just to have a think. The NDP has put forward a few private members' bills over the years, not just in this session, that have achieved consensus in the House. How do they become law? They become law by going through the Senate. This is part of Canada's Constitution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783248">The vote on the estimates that has been put forward here is for this upcoming fiscal year. Our government asked for a Supreme Court opinion on what we could and could not do in the House in terms of scope for Senate reform. We were obviously quite disappointed with the outcome of that decision. That said, my colleague the <Affiliation DbId="194598" Type="4">Minister of State for Democratic Reform</Affiliation> has talked about how we as a government will press forward on this particular issue because it is something of concern to Canadians. We also have to look at this upcoming fiscal year, which is the subject matter of the estimates.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783249">I would like to see government continue to operate because I would like to see legislation continue to go through the House. I hope that my colleagues will give pause for thought on this one and support Vote 1, because the reality is that this is part of Canada's Constitution. We need to separate the debate around how we could reform the Senate, which again is worthy of debate, from the reality of this particular motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783250">I could go through numerous bills in terms of how this particular vote would affect them. The Senate right now has a very heavy legislative calendar. Many of the committees are tasked with a review of bills that have come from here.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3783251">Certainly my colleagues opposite would say that there is support for some or all components of some of these bills. I would like to see those bills passed. I would like to see that process continue to operate, which is why we support Vote 1 in the estimates. It is because constitutionally we need the Senate to operate in order for legislation to be passed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783252">It is very short-sighted for us as a House to sit here and say we cannot fund the Senate and that we are going to pull the funding from it. How, constitutionally, would we put legislation through? I just do not understand this. It is actually a little mind-blowing that the substance of this situation has not come up. Constitutionally, the Senate has to operate. Certainly in the next fiscal year, even if we work at lightspeed beyond the speed of government, the Senate has a job to do right now, and certainly we would all say that we should continue to support it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783253">Because the topic of Senate reform has come up in debate tonight, I would like to take this opportunity, because I have been itching to do so for a few months, to talk about the approach to Senate reform of my colleagues in the Liberal Party.

                <Affiliation DbId="194595">Hon. Michelle Rempel: </Affiliation> Mr. Speaker, my colleagues in the NDP are talking about this bozo eruption. Mr. Speaker, that is really not how we should be talking about this very weighty component of legislation that could potentially come before the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783261"> It is also important to note that in the last year, as someone on this side of this place, I know we are all subject to very transparent and rigorous reporting functions. I have been glad to see that we have had some all-party dialogue on how MPs can report their expenses and how we can have more accountability and transparency in that area. Certainly that is something that the Senate side should be following as well, and over the last year we have seen the adoption of some new rules in the Senate for reporting expenses. That is a step in the right direction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783262">Again, just to recap, to simply eliminate this particular item out of the estimates and say we are not going to let the Senate operate is perhaps not the best approach. I know it is late in the year and sometimes we have a propensity to grandstand and try to capture debate in a way that it should not be. I do not think anyone in this country who has any background in civics or who has taken grade 6 social studies could honestly say that in this fiscal year we should shut down the Senate and prevent legislation from passing. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="55">(2155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3783263">Legislative gridlock is a problem. If we voted to have legislative gridlock in this place, industry would be quite upset about that. The international community would be somewhat shocked, would scratch their heads and wonder why Canadians would be shutting down their constitutional process to have legislation go through.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783264">The follow-up to that would be a lack of investment, capital flight, and implications for the delivery of government programs and services. All of these sorts of things would happen because, constitutionally, this is how legislation is passed in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783265">In the coming days, months and years, the topic of Senate reform and how we deal with that is something with which we will be seized, and we should be. However, shutting down the Senate in this fiscal year is perhaps not the wisest possible course of action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783266">It is a privilege to stand in this place. There is a certain amount of theatre that happens at certain points of the day, but at the end of the day, especially when we look internationally at some of the unrest that happens in other parts of the world, to stand here, especially as a relatively young woman, in a democracy to debate matters of substance and weight and to speak on behalf of my constituents is a privilege.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783267">There are better things to do with our time than to try to have PR stunts around shutting down our legislative process. Just to re-emphasize, if this funding does not go through, the Senate ceases to operate. I would just ask that perhaps my colleagues across the way could have a little more of a think around the motions they put forward. Surely there are other parts of the estimates that we could have had a very rigorous debate around, such as the efficacy of funding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783268">Surely, my colleagues opposite cannot expect that the Government of Canada would see legislative gridlock for the next several years. I am not sure what to say. This is kind of crazy. It is just one of those things that we look at and know that we have to speak to it, because we need to have laws passed and we need to have our democracy continue to function.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783269">I hope my colleagues opposite will have a change of heart. Everyone in this place agrees that the topic of Senate reform is one that is worthy. It is one that will have heated debate. There are divisions on how to approach that even within our party structures, within our caucuses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783270">When we are talking about the business of supply and funding that is going to the Senate, I would like to see legislation continue to pass. I am sure my colleagues opposite who have private members' business on the agenda, would like to see their legislation considered by the other place, hopefully passed and become law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783271">In the name of sanity, in the name of rationality and in the name of respecting the debate here, I would ask my colleagues to understand that in the next fiscal year we need the Senate to operate in order to pass legislation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3783497"> Mr. Speaker, I asked the <Affiliation DbId="194607" Type="4">tourism minister</Affiliation> to fix his mistakes and stop bragging about cutting the Canadian Tourism Commission's budget by 20% or one-fifth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783498">This week is Tourism Week in Canada, and it is high time that the minister took responsibility and that the government invested in our tourism industry, which creates many good jobs in every region of the country and promotes the development of our SMEs, the country's main economic engine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783499">We must keep the industry competitive and take note of the Rozon report, for example. There is no good reason to cut the commission's budget by 20%. These cuts will have a disastrous effect on the industry. The funding must continue so that the our country remains competitive internationally. There is a lot of competition, and the government must invest rather than making cuts. The government must do something about the fact that this industry is underfunded. Tourism is suffering greatly right now because of the Conservatives' lack of interest in this industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783500">In 2013, the number of tourists who visited Canada increased by 2.9%, which is woefully inadequate when compared to the fact that the number of international tourists increased by 5% elsewhere in the world. It is unbelievable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783501">Furthermore, from 2002 to 2012, the number of international visitors to Canada dropped, and Canada fell from 7th to 16th out of the top 20 countries. In 2013 we dropped again to 17th place. If we do not do something now, we will plunge even further down the list and we will never be able to recover from where we have fallen these past few years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783502">That is why the situation is urgent and worrisome. Hotels, the Office du tourisme, the Canadian Tourism Commission, restaurants and everyone who participates directly or indirectly in this industry will suffer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783503">In order to get back into the top 10 international tourist destinations, we need to continue making investments. I have a table from the Canadian Tourism Commission that supports what I am saying. If we had maintained or improved our investments in tourism, our increase would have been higher than global growth, since our share of the market was 25% in 1996 before dropping to 12.5% in 2011.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783504">Canada will once again lose one-quarter of its share of the market for long-haul international trips by 2015. That is a loss of 1.2 million potential visitors and $834 million in new export earnings. We need to do everything we can not only to maintain investments, but also to improve this industry. The industry could certainly use it.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="194825" Type="18">Hon. Deepak Obhrai (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and for International Human Rights, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3783505">Mr. Speaker, I am happy to respond to the comments made earlier by the hon. member regarding tourism marketing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783506">Tourism is an important sector for all regions across Canada. The Government of Canada supports the competitiveness of our national tourism sector and works closely with industry to ensure that Canada remains a top tourist destination. This is exactly what we committed to in last year's Speech from the Throne.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783507"> There is plenty of good news on this front. I am pleased to note that the industry continues to grow. In 2013, tourism revenues in Canada increased by 3% to over $84 billion, and the tourism sector provided more than 618,000 jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783508">To sustain the growth and positive momentum of our tourism sector, the Government of Canada launched the federal tourism strategy in 2011. The strategy positions Canada's tourism sector to take advantage of international growth opportunities. So far it has yielded tangible results to reduce barriers that were hampering the performance of the sector. For example, we have signed 80 air transport agreements with top priority markets such as China, India, and Japan. There are also a growing number of visa application centres worldwide. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783509">We have a very talented marketing agency that does a great job of attracting international tourists to Canada. The Canadian Tourism Commission promotes Canada as a premier tourist destination in priority markets around the world, some of which have shown impressive growth. For example, the number of visitors from China grew by over 22% last year. India is another market that is showing great growth potential. That is why the <Affiliation DbId="194607" Type="4">Minister of State for Tourism</Affiliation> led a tourism stakeholder mission to India in February 2013.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783510"> The Canadian Tourism Commission has also been successful in attracting meetings, conventions, and business travellers to Canada, which together generated $120 million in revenue last year. In fact, the CTC played a central role in convincing the internationally renowned TED Conference to relocate to Vancouver from its home in California this year and in 2015. This was a huge win for Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783511"> Furthermore, the Canadian Tourism Commission's business model allows it to adapt quickly to changing market conditions and to leverage new opportunities as they arise. In fact, the CTC leveraged 80¢ in contributions from industry partners for every dollar of appropriations in 2013, allowing for a greater marketing and advertising reach for Canadian tourism. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783512">Last year the Canadian Tourism Commission's partners contributed $47.7 million to its marketing activities and events. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783513">Tourism in Canada is growing. At the same time, our industry is facing increased competition worldwide. To be successful, Canada's tourism industry must innovate and adapt to offer the memorable experiences travellers are seeking. Governments can help by creating an environment for our tourism businesses to compete and thrive. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3783514">Mr. Speaker, I think that this government is hiding its head in the sand like an ostrich. It has blinders on. However, it must take action now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783515">There is no doubt that this government has done absolutely nothing. It caused particular harm to the tourism industry with its employment insurance reform. It also refused to improve the condition of Parks Canada infrastructure. Parks Canada needs ongoing investments to update its facilities and make it easier to access the parks. The government could also make it easier for Mexicans to get visas, for example, because we know that the industry is asking for that. The temporary foreign worker program is now in complete disarray. This is obviously having an impact on the tourism industry in my riding and likely in the ridings of many members here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783516">If the government does not take action to defend the industry, we will suffer for it later. For example, the government made cuts to the International Festival of Military Bands in Quebec City, which brought in about $12 million and cost about $3 million. There are other examples of similar situations. The government is depriving the country of extra money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3783517">It is a shame and a disgrace, and it is what we call burying one's head in the sand.</ParaText>
