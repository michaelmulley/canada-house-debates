The measures proposed in Motion No. 532 are complementary to the 14 substantial recommendations deemed most important by the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs, which were tabled in June in a report entitled “The New Veterans Charter: Moving Forward”.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855273">That report was unanimous, a rare event here in Parliament. Everyone on all sides worked very hard to make it so, and everyone was prepared to put a little water in their wine to move the yardsticks ahead in a substantial way for our veterans. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855274">I will address what Motion No. 532 says, describe how it relates to the committee report, and discuss the government response and the way ahead.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855275">Serving our veterans has been a stated objective of every government of Canada, and our government is no exception. This objective has always been, and will always be, a work in progress. No matter what any government does, there will always be more that we would like to do and there will always be those who will find fault. That is because everyone loves veterans for what they have done and for who they are, and that is the way it should be.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855276">Canada's development as an independent country with a unique identity stems in no small measure from its achievements in times of war and in other less dangerous but nonetheless important missions. The Department of Veterans Affairs exists to repay the nation's debt of gratitude toward those whose courageous efforts have given us this legacy and have contributed to our growth as a nation. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855277">VAC's mandate stems from laws and regulations. The <Affiliation DbId="194615" Type="4">Minister of Veterans Affairs</Affiliation> is charged with, <I>inter alia</I>, the following responsibilities:</ParaText><ParaText id="3855278"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...the care, treatment or re-establishment in civil life of any person who served in the Canadian Forces or merchant navy or the naval, army or air forces or merchant navies of Her Majesty, of any person who has otherwise engaged in pursuits relating to war, and of any other person designated</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3855279">and </ParaText><ParaText id="3855280"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...the care of dependants or survivors of any person referred to...</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3855281">The department meets its responsibilities through its various programs. These include programs for disability pensions, veterans allowances, pension advocacy, health care, and commemoration. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855282">They provide compensation for hardships arising from disabilities and lost economic opportunities, innovative health and social services, professional legal assistance, and recognition of the achievements and sacrifices of Canadians during periods of war and conflict. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855283">The mission of Veterans Affairs Canada is to provide exemplary client-centred services and benefits that honour the sacrifice and achievements of our veterans and clients and that respond to the needs of veterans, other clients, and their families.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855284">I want to go back to what is a key phrase in the quote of the minister's responsibilities, and that is “re-establishment in civil life”. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855285">This is the key concept in the overall philosophy of service to veterans by the department. The aim of veterans' programs is not lifelong financial dependence, unless that is the only option; the aim of the programs is to give veterans every support possible to help those who cannot or do not wish to continue to serve in the military the tools they need to succeed in carving out a good future on their own terms. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855286">Motion No. 532 proposes five things. It says that in the opinion of the House, the government should examine all possible options to ensure a fully unified “continuum of care” approach is in place to serve Canada's men and women in uniform and veterans, so as to do five things: first, eliminate all unnecessary bureaucratic processes, both within and between departments, related to service delivery; second, eliminate duplication and overlap in the delivery of available services and supports; third, further improve care and support, particularly for seriously injured veterans; fourth, provide continuous support for veterans' families during and after service; and fifth, strengthen the connections between the Canadian Armed Forces, the Department of National Defence, and Veterans Affairs Canada.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855287">The veterans affairs committee identified three core themes in its recent study. First was the care and support of the most seriously disabled, the second was support for families, and the and third was improving how Veterans Affairs Canada delivers the programs, services, and benefits under the new veterans charter. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855288">Committee members unanimously agreed that the principles of the new veterans charter should be upheld and that these principles foster an approach that is well suited to today's veterans. This does not mean that improvements cannot be made; however, the legitimate criticisms of various aspects of the new veterans charter should not overshadow the fact that it is a solid foundation upon which to help veterans transition to civilian life when a service-related medical condition prevents them from continuing their military career.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855289">While implementing the recommendations in this report would not solve everything, the committee believes that the recommendations represent a major step forward and express more fully Canadians' solemn commitment to veterans and their families. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855290">The committee also hopes that this report will help to foster an improved relationship of trust that must exist among veterans, Canadians, the parliamentarians representing them, and the Government of Canada that must earn their confidence.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855291">The story we heard over and over again at committee was that in too many cases when someone left the Canadian Armed Forces, he or she spent time in a no man's land before getting connected to the services of Veterans Affairs. This gap led to many difficulties of financial, physical, and psychological natures and made it much harder to transition to a stable and productive civilian life.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855292">Private member's Motion No. 532 addresses some of those challenges directly and is in lockstep with the first recommendation of the committee report, which, in abbreviated form, says that military members seriously disabled as a result of service will not be medically released until the individual is in a stable medical condition, medical records have been given to the individual and transferred to Veterans Affairs Canada, applications for services and benefits have been adjudicated, the file has been assigned to a case manager who has already established contact, and supporting health care and rehabilitation professionals have been identified and their responsibilities defined in the area where the veteran is planning to live. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855293">Recommendation 1 also states that an internal committee should be struck by Veterans Affairs Canada and the Canadian Armed Forces to develop an interchangeable and unified list of service conditions to ensure that the service-related condition identified by the Canadian Armed Forces that led to the veteran’s medical release will be recognized by Veterans Affairs Canada for adjudication purposes and that a follow-up protocol should be established for all military members who have been released for medical reasons.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855294">I think members can see how this blends nicely with private member's Motion No. 532 in a continuum of service that this act would provide.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855295">Overall, the philosophy of the report and of private member's Motion No. 532 is to ensure that the provisions of the various acts and the veterans bill of rights shall be liberally construed and interpreted to the end that the recognized solemn obligation of the people and Government of Canada to provide compensation to those members of the forces who have been disabled or have died as a result of military service, and to their dependants, may be fulfilled. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855296">There are many other substantial recommendations in the report, and I will abbreviate them. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855297">One is that the most seriously disabled veterans receive financial benefits for life, of which an appropriate portion should be transferable to their spouse in the event of death.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855298">Another is that the earnings loss benefit be non-taxable and set at 85% of net income, up to a net income threshold of $70,000, and that it be adjusted annually to the consumer price index. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855299">Another recommendation is that all veterans with service-related disabilities, and their families, be entitled to the same benefits and support whether they are regular force or reserve. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855300">Another is that military family resource centres be available to veterans and their families to provide additional support in their transition to civilian life.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855301">Another is that access to psychosocial and vocational rehabilitation services be given to spouses or common-law partners, that access to psychological counselling be also given to parents and children of veterans, and that financial support be provided to family members of seriously disabled veterans acting as primary caregivers. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855302">Another recommendation is that VAC undertake a comprehensive review of the amount of the disability award to more adequately reflect awards in civil liability cases for personal injuries, and improve support for financial counselling throughout the process. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855303">Another is that the Canadian Armed Forces and Veterans Affairs Canada together, as quickly as possible, eliminate overlap between the service income security insurance plan, or SISIP, programs and those provided by Veterans Affairs Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855304">A further recommendation is that eligible vocational rehabilitation training programs be allowed greater flexibility. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855305">Another is that VAC establish a more rigorous case manager training program, review the case manager-to-veteran ratio, and provide necessary resources for its adjustment. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855306">Another is that VAC and DND build on existing collaborative efforts to provide adequate resources for research and understanding of known and emerging manifestations of operational stress injuries. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855307">Another is that VAC consider moving towards a payment system with one comprehensive and clear monthly payment, while ensuring the net benefit to the veteran is not reduced. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855308">Another is that VAC and DND table their official response within 120 days and also table a report outlining the progress made on implementing the recommendations by January 30, 2015.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855309">The first milestone has been met, and I know that there is some very concentrated and intense effort going toward meeting the second milestone in a manner that will give veterans confidence that the government has listened and is acting, because we have and we are. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855310">Contrary to some misleading and outright false comments by some hon. members and some people with axes that they just will not stop grinding, the government has not rejected any of the recommendations of the report. It is, in fact, quite the contrary. Building on these enhancements to the new veterans charter, the government is pleased to indicate that it agrees with the spirit and intent of the vast majority of the committee's recommendations. Many of these recommendations involve potentially complex changes to some veterans programming, and the implications of any potential changes must, therefore, be carefully assessed. Any government would have to do the same thing. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855311">Therefore, the government plans to address the recommendations made in the report using a phased approach, and private member's Motion No. 532 will be helpful in guiding that process.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3855312">The first stage is to address those recommendations that can be quickly achieved within existing authorities and budgets of Veterans Affairs Canada and the Department of National Defence, and which will improve the continuum of service provided to veterans and their families when they leave the Canadian Armed Forces.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855313"> The more complex recommendations require further interdepartmental work, budgetary analysis, and coordination with a wide range of federal departments, as well as with the Veterans Ombudsman and veterans' groups. These recommendations will be considered in a second phase.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855314">This is the only approach that makes common sense. There is no magic wand that any government could wave to bypass legislated requirements for ensuring that processes with taxpayers' money are followed. It just does not happen that way. Anyone with any grasp of the complexities of the financial and regulatory realities of government will understand that this is true.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855315">I know and understand why people want everything fixed instantly, but that is just not realistically or practically possible. What we need is steady and measurable progress to achieve our objectives, and that is what we will see. I know that people want to play politics in this place and that's what this place is all about, but surely this is one area where we can all come together to make a great many of the changes for which people have been advocating. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855316">There are many people and organizations dedicated to improving how we look after our veterans. I am one of those people and our government is one of those organizations. Everyone across the floor is that kind of person as well.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855317"> We are joined by members of the opposition parties and many stakeholder organizations such as the Royal Canadian Legion, ANAVETS, True Patriot Love, Veterans Transition Network, Wounded Warriors, military unit foundations and many more. By working together to pursue progress, we will succeed at what I have already said will probably always be a work-in-progress. There will always be new circumstances and new challenges as Canada continues to play an important role in world affairs. That is no more apparent than in what is happening in the Middle East, in Iraq and Syria, and so on.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855318">We should not let anyone's image of the perfect be the enemy of the very good. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855319">I proudly served in a regular force uniform for over 30 years and in an honorary capacity for another five years. I am one of the almost 700,000 veterans in Canada, but I am not one of the approximately 200,000 clients of Veterans Affairs Canada because I currently have no issues that require assistance. At some point, I probably will have need of some service or benefit, and I have every confidence that I will be supported by the people whom I know are dedicated to providing the best service possible.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855320"> I would like to go further than Motion No. 532 in terms of the integration of Veterans Affairs Canada and the Canadian Armed Forces and Department of National Defence. I would personally like to see an in-depth study of the possibility of merging the departments under one roof. I can understand why that may be a bridge too far for some right now, but I think that this could be an area for further study in a future Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855321"> Until that time, I firmly believe that private member's Motion No. 532 is a substantial step in the right direction in conjunction with other measures I have described, and I urge all honourable members to lend it their support.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It is another opportunity to talk about our veterans, who feel strongly—feel certain even, because it is certain—that, at times, this government is abandoning them, especially those who are seriously injured.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855323">I would also like to comment on something my colleague said. He mentioned that members of the opposition are playing political games. It is not so much playing games as critiquing the work of the minister, who is all too often slow to acknowledge that the new charter does not fulfill all of our veterans' needs.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855324">Coming back to the motion, I would like to thank my colleague for moving it. I also want to thank him for his service in the Canadian Forces. Could the member talk about whether he considered including RCMP members in this motion, so that they, too, can have access to this continuum of care that he is proposing for our veterans?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Hawn" id="8472777"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170581" Type="2">Hon. Laurie Hawn</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3855325">Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague and I worked well together on the veterans affairs committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855326">There is impression and then there is reality. Impression is easy to foster and easy to blow up in the face of reality. That is all I will say about that. We have done a lot more than we are given credit for, and that will continue.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855327">With respect to politics, I am not trying to pick on the politics in this place. It is just a reality. This place is about politics, and that is just what we do. However, we can get beyond that, as we did with the committee report, as we did with the study. We got beyond politics in that committee with the 10 people we had, and we came up with a great report. That is what we can do when we get beyond the politics, which is a function of this place and will always be a function of this place. That is just the way it is.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855328">With respect to the RCMP, that is a valid question. The challenge we have in doing that is that the way Veterans Affairs interacts with the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Forces is quite different than the way they interact with the RCMP. Doing some things within the sphere of Veterans Affairs Canada, the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces would not apply in quite the same way to the RCMP. It is a valid point, and that is something that could be looked at in another piece of legislation or another motion.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Valeriote" id="8472780"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170547" Type="2">Mr. Frank Valeriote (Guelph, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3855329">Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to acknowledge the efforts of the member for <Affiliation DbId="170581" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> on the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs. We have worked collaboratively and effectively. We do not play politics with issues like this. We do try to get beyond politics and while I have no particular axe to grind, it is not enough to say that we all love our veterans. We have to show them. We have to show a commitment to our sacred covenant.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855330">Yes, the gears of government turn slowly, but the government has known for years the problems our veterans are facing right now. It is not a recent phenomenon or recent awareness. The Conservatives closed nine veterans offices across the country at a cost of $5 million. They spent $4 million on self-promoting advertising on a program that only costs about $200,000 for transitional services. That is $4 million on advertising versus $5 million to keep a veterans office open.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855331">I want to know from the member why the minister has kicked the can down the road yet again. There were unanimous proposals and recommendations that we thought would tie him in because of the unanimity, but he has kicked the can down the road again. Please do not give me that it takes time for government to transition.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Hawn" id="8472782"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170581" Type="2">Hon. Laurie Hawn</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3855332">Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for the question, but it does disturb me because he and the Liberal Party know better. They have been in power before and it is not kicking the can down the road. There are legislated requirements for how government spends money. Regardless of what it is spent on, regardless of the obvious merit of that money, there is a process that has to be followed. Any government in power has to follow the same process. This government did not invent that. It has been there for decades and decades. It involves Treasury Board, involves work between departments, involves the Finance Department and the member behind the member who raised the question knows that full well as a former finance minister.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855333">Veterans issues have been around basically forever. It is no different than it was under the Pension Act. There were all kinds of complaints under the Pension Act that were valid. We are making progress and moving forward. It does not happen overnight and the member knows that. I am a little disappointed in the tone of his question. We will continue to work together. We will continue to make progress, but it is going to take time. People need a little patience. I am not talking about that member grinding an axe; I am talking about other people who do not live in this House.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Chicoine" id="8472794"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170160" Type="2">Mr. Sylvain Chicoine (Châteauguay—Saint-Constant, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3855334">Mr. Speaker, I am clearly quite pleased to be speaking to the motion moved by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170581" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>. This motion calls on the government to ensure that a continuum of care is put in place to help our veterans.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855335">Unfortunately, since they came to power, the Conservatives have not done very much to improve our veterans' quality of life. My colleague was very involved in the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs' study of the new charter. I want to thank him for his work. There was a unanimous report calling on the <Affiliation DbId="194615" Type="4">Minister of Veterans Affairs</Affiliation> to make changes to improve life for our veterans. Certain concessions had to be made so that it would be unanimous.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855336">During the study, which took place over the course of 14 meetings, 54 witnesses appeared. The vast majority of them said that they had had enough of all of the reports that kept piling up over the years but never amounted to anything. No improvements have been made to the new charter, which is supposed to be a living document. Since 2006, one single change—and a pretty minor one considering all of the problems that have cropped up—has been made. That is not good enough at all. Following the report, the minister waited as long as possible to respond, then said that he planned to study the issues again. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855337">Veterans have had enough. They want us to take action now. They do not want to keep talking about all of these problems. People know what the problems are. They have been identified umpteen times already. We need a solution right now. Over the years, a budget shortfall developed and the government made many cuts to Veterans Affairs Canada to balance the budget. Now there is a budget surplus. It was unacceptable for the government to cut Veterans Affairs Canada's budget back then, and it is indecent to start accumulating a surplus at our veterans' expense now. People are calling on the minister to stop studying the issue and come up with real solutions to help these veterans, especially the seriously injured who are coping with all kinds of problems. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855338">The minister responded favourably to the report's conclusions. Now it is time for him to take action and introduce legislation. We believe he is simply trying to stall for time. More time is being given to study this to see how this new charter can be appropriately improved. That is fine with me, but the problems have been well known for quite some time. We cannot wait any longer. Veterans can no longer wait for better care. The minister needs to come before the House with an action plan immediately. He must not wait until next year's budget before allocating new money to improve veterans' allowances. We are aware of the problems. They have been illustrated once again with this study, with all the situations the ombudsman has described and with the other reports. The minister needs to come up with a solution and with concrete improvements for this new charter, but now, not next year.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855339">Anyone who paid attention to the news last week knows that we are heading into an election year. Is the minister waiting for the budget and then the election campaign? That appears to be the case. Will there be enough time for the budget to go through all the necessary stages and be implemented to improve the lives of our veterans? People should not have to wait any longer. The government cannot continue amassing surpluses on the backs of our veterans, as it has been doing for the past few days and weeks. We know what the problems are; now we need to come up with solutions.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855340">I urge the minister to have a closer look at this issue and come up with a report to improve the new charter. That is my main message today.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855341">Another thing I noted about the government response is that it proposes two phases. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3855342">This response suggests that the government is going to keep our veterans waiting for weeks, even months. If the election is called, the bill will not have gone through all the stages. We cannot let another day go by without helping our veterans, especially those who are seriously injured. They have to have better support from Veterans Affairs Canada, and simply adopting a motion is not going to cut it. I commend the hon. member for moving this motion, but if the minister implemented the recommendations that have been made, then we would have solutions that would help our veterans immensely. That would be preferable, since it is already too late in my books.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855343">Here we are debating the motion by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170581" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>. I find it ironic, given the Conservative government's refusal to propose a solution to immediately address the most critical problems. It prefers to wait and stall for time. Worse yet, the government is going to vote in favour of this motion and will likely wait for weeks before doing anything with it. We do not need any more motions like this. We absolutely need a bill from the minister that will change the new veterans charter and implement the recommendations made in the report on the review of the charter.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855344">I am pleased to say that we will support this motion because we think it is important to let the government know how important it is to improve care for veterans. After more than 20 years of Liberal and Conservative cuts to the budgets of National Defence and Veterans Affairs Canada, the NDP is the only party left with any credibility and the will to live up to the sacred obligation to improve the quality of life of our veterans.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855345">The motion talks about a continuum of care for our veterans. The fact that our veterans feel abandoned by the Canadian Armed Forces after they leave the military is a major problem. That is why a continuum of care approach is important. The member for <Affiliation DbId="170581" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> is absolutely right about the fact that the transfer of responsibility for veterans from the Canadian Armed Forces to Veterans Affairs Canada must be as smooth as possible. Our veterans should not feel abandoned after having given so much in service to our country. That is why the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs recommended that veterans not be released from the Canadian Armed Forces until arrangements have been made to get them all the help and care they need.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855346">The Veterans Review and Appeal Board can also be a hindrance to obtaining care. The board sometimes errs when determining whether a veteran has a service-related disability. Those veterans are then unable to receive care until the board recognizes that they have such a disability.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855347">I would also like to address the issue of families, who seem to be ignored, particularly in the new veterans charter. This charter does not really provide for family-centred care. That is obviously a problem. Families need all kinds of support. They are not entitled to full access to Veterans Affairs Canada programs without going through the veteran. Veterans have to request psychological help for their family members. Otherwise, they cannot get it.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855348">Families also do not have access to military family resource centres. Many families feel abandoned when veterans make the transition to civilian life. Most families are exhausted, do not sleep enough and do not have time for personal activities. Not surprisingly, most of them indicated during the study of this issue that their health has been significantly affected. This has a major impact on interpersonal relationships and on the family.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855349">Furthermore, RCMP veterans seem to have been left out of this motion when they should also have access to this continuum of care.</ParaText>

					<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Valeriote" id="8472803"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170547" Type="2">Mr. Frank Valeriote (Guelph, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3855351">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak to Motion No. 532 put forward by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170581" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>. When it comes to this subject matter, the credentials of the sponsor of this motion are impeccable. It is truly an honour to serve with him on the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs, and I genuinely mean that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855352">The motion, which calls on the government to examine all possible options to ensure that a fully unified continuum of care is available to our women and men in the Canadian Armed Forces and our veterans, is good. It is self-evident to me and to many other members of this House that the elimination of unnecessary or redundant inter-departmental and intra-departmental practices surrounding the delivery of services, assistance to families, and other programming, is necessary for us to deal fairly with the men and women who have sacrificed so much. In fact, I would go even further than it being necessary; I would say it is fundamental to fulfilling our sacred obligation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855353">It was another Conservative, our then prime minister Sir Robert Borden, who promised Canadians returning from the battlefields of the First World War that there existed a social covenant between the government and veterans. What former prime minister Borden understood, and what this motion underscores, is that the women and men serving in the Canadian Armed Forces serve with the knowledge that they are called upon to accept unlimited liability. There were hundreds of thousands who paid the full limit of that liability with their lives. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855354">When they return from theatre, if they return, these men and women should expect their government to honour their side of the bargain and provide the necessary resources for physical or emotional rehabilitation, further education and skills translation, or adequate, sufficient, and accessible compensation for their disabilities.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855355">While the current government has instructed its lawyers in British Columbia to argue that this covenant is merely a political promise to get votes rather than it being an inalienable right, Liberals believe not only that our sacred obligation is real, but that we must abide by it. In fact, Liberals from across the country gathered in February to pass a resolution to that effect.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855356">We believe that where Canadians have served their country honourably as members of the Canadian Armed Forces, their service requires a personal commitment to put one's life on the line on behalf of their fellow Canadians. Moreover, this service is not only borne by members of the Canadian Armed Forces but also their families. We will live up to Canada's sacred obligation to our Armed Forces and veterans by allowing them and their loved ones to maintain a quality of life worthy of their sacrifice. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855357">Unfortunately, the current Conservative government has wandered away from similar commitments.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855358"> To start, the Conservatives have cut hundreds of millions of dollars from Veterans Affairs Canada, tying the hands of the department when it comes to delivering the benefits and supports that veterans rely on. Even more egregiously, the current government has closed nine regional Veterans Affairs offices, making it more difficult for veterans to access these benefits and services in their communities. It is unconscionable that veterans, some of them seniors, might have to drive hours outside of their communities to receive face-to-face help. Conservatives have claimed that veterans can still attend nearby Service Canada centres for services, but front-line staff at Service Canada are not trained to specifically help veterans, and case workers are currently burdened with a four-to-one caseload ratio.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855359">Take for instance the case of veterans in Glace Bay, in the riding of my colleague the honourable member for <Affiliation DbId="170638" Type="2">Cape Breton—Canso</Affiliation>. Since the government shut down the Veterans Affairs Canada office in Sydney, volunteer service officers at the Royal Canadian Legion have been working tirelessly in an effort to fill the void created for veterans in the region. Whereas the VAC staff, formerly located in the Sydney office, knew the forms, the veterans, and the benefits to which these veterans might be entitled, the volunteers at the Legion, well intentioned though they are, simply do not have the expertise or training or resources to cope with the workload that the government should be doing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855360">None of this should take away from the motion before us. I believe that the honourable member, like so many Canadians, also sees gaps in the treatment and availability of resources, which is why he presented this inspired motion.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855361">The motion calls specifically for five things to occur to ensure a fully unified continuum of care: (a) that all unnecessary bureaucratic practices, both within and between departments related to service delivery are eliminated; (b) that all duplication and overlap in the delivery of available services and supports are eliminated; (c) that care and support, in particular for seriously injured veterans be improved; (d) that continuous support is provided to veterans' families during and after their service; and, (e) that connections between the Canadian Armed Forces, the Department of National Defence, and Veterans Affairs Canada get stronger.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3855362">However, the fact this motion has been brought at all proves that the Conservative government is failing many of our veterans.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855363">Many of these obstacles were highlighted clearly in the testimony before the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs by Corporal Mark Fuchko, who when asked upon his return by the parliamentary secretary for Veterans Affairs to elaborate about his experience dealing with the Department of National Defence and Veterans Affairs Canada, answered the following:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855364"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">When I first came home, I was not the first amputee from the war in Afghanistan and I constantly ran into hurdles that really affected my quality of life and my family's as well. Things like aids to daily living were almost impossible to obtain. Just to get my house accessible took over a year. That was a really long drawn-out nightmare. I'm not the only one who actually experienced that. There seemed to be kind of a battle with what was covered and what was not and who would cover what. That was quite a challenge, and it seems to me that there was a lot of overlap, but people weren't necessarily sure if Veterans Affairs or the military was going to cover it, and things like lead time, house modifications, and stuff like that were a real challenge for sure. I would say that probably the one common thing is housing, especially for the severely disabled. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3855365"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The military originally took this on but there is a whole group of caveats that make it difficult for the delivery of this in a timely fashion. For example, some people find themselves severely disabled coming back to houses that they can't physically occupy just because their houses are not wheelchair friendly, wheelchair safe. They essentially require a whole new house to live in. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855366">I ask the House for its indulgence for that lengthy quote because I believe it demonstrates the current experience of Canadian Armed Forces members and veterans so clearly.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855367">Corporal Fuchko lost both legs in Afghanistan. He should not have to fight with individual departments so he can get the bare minimum of living accommodations suitable to his new reality. It is unconscionable, and from the testimony we heard at committee, not an experience that is exclusive to him. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855368">We would support any measure to facilitate this system, instead of presenting veterans and Canadian Armed Forces members with a maze upon their return.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855369">The family is another vital element, if not the cornerstone upon which many of these benefits should be built. In his testimony before committee, former senator, retired Lieutenant-General Roméo Dallaire, highlighted the enhanced roles that families play in deployments and rehabilitation. He said:</ParaText><ParaText id="3855370"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...by the time we come back from those missions, we see a family who has also lived the missions. The families are now living the missions with the members. It is not a separated exercise. It is a marriage.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855371">As with Jenny Migneault, the wife of a veteran who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, her advocacy highlights that beyond the medical professionals and past the bureaucrats, there are wives, husbands, and children, among other loved ones, who are shouldering the burden of service in the Canadian Armed Forces but without any of the resources or support.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855372">It is each of these people, and hundreds of thousands more, to whom we owe the obligation to break down the obstacles that currently exist. To them, we owe the passage of this motion. However, more than that, they deserve that this motion receives real and concerted consideration by the Conservative government. They do not deserve the same consideration that saw the <Affiliation DbId="194615" Type="4">Minister of Veterans Affairs</Affiliation> respond to 14 unanimous recommendations from the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs that examined the new veterans charter by kicking them down the road to a yet to be determined date, with no concrete action. They deserve the consideration requisite to the severity and significance of the sacrifice made by our men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces, yesterday, today, and tomorrow.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855373">I thank the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170581" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> for raising this important motion and for his advocacy on behalf of the Canadian Armed Forces and veterans. I hope we can all do the right thing by not only passing this motion but by acting on it now.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="40">(1140)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. O'Toole" id="8472806"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="194848" Type="18">Mr. Erin O'Toole (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of International Trade, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3855374">Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honour to stand today to speak to this important motion, M-532, which really touches on a number of things our government has already been moving forward in terms of improving and removing unnecessary bureaucracy from veterans care. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855375">My colleague's proposal really is to develop a continuum of care, something that recognizes that care will evolve and that there is an important handover for our veterans, which I will speak to in my remarks.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855376">I thank my friend and colleague, the MP for <Affiliation DbId="170581" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>. Often in dialogue across the country we hear, can a single MP get much done? Pierre Trudeau's famous quote about MPs being nobodies 30 metres from Parliament Hill is a fallacy. If people are members of this House and they care about an issue, they can advance it remarkably. One does not have to be the leader of a party. One does not have to be a minister. One just has to be a passionate advocate. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855377">That is what we have in my friend, the MP from <Affiliation DbId="170581" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>, a passionate advocate for the men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces, and a passionate advocate with decades of experience working with veterans. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855378">He noted in his remarks to this House that he is just one of the 600,000 to 700,000 veterans in Canada, but his is an important voice, because he is here in Parliament. I consider myself his understudy in many ways. We represent the Royal Canadian Air Force caucus here in the House of Commons. We are a pilot and a navigator who are aircrew who fly and tease each other relentlessly. We are here working on issues of mutual concern, namely our men and women who serve this country.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855379">What has been discussed a little bit in this House but has never been thoroughly explored in the way it should be is how we can serve veterans within this continuum of care my friend from <Affiliation DbId="170581" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> has suggested in a way that recognizes that those 600,000 to 700,000 Canadians are vastly different.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855380">We heard my friend from <Affiliation DbId="170547" Type="2">Guelph</Affiliation> talk about the offices and things like that again. Veterans are not a unified force who all access services the same way. We have in Canada right now war veterans in their 20s from the Afghanistan conflict. We also have veterans in their 90s. In fact, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170581" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> and I met a 101-year-old veteran in Normandy who travelled with the Canadian contingent to recognize the anniversary in France. The 101-year-old veteran parked his walker and walked down to Juno Beach. It was remarkable. Does the 101-year-old veteran access services the same way the 25-year-old veteran does? No, he does not. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855381">Veterans Affairs has tried to realize that, apart from some of the dialogue we hear in Ottawa from so-called advocates who do not even understand how veterans are served, there are 15,000 veterans in their twenties who have signed up for what is called the My VAC account. They can manage their own accounts online. They want to. People from that generation have never had banking chequebooks that they have taken into a branch. Veterans Affairs has worked on apps and on online accounts, because we have thousands of veterans who want to access and learn about their benefits that way.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855382">We also still have veterans in their 80s and 90s who need assistance, and the vast majority of those do not go to stand-alone bricks and mortar Veterans Affairs offices. For decades they have been helped by veterans service officers at Legions, a fact that a Liberal critic did not even appear to know when we were talking about how veterans access services. The Legion was empowered by an act of Parliament in 1925 to help veterans access their services. That is part of its mandate. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855383">My veterans service officer for Branch 178, which I belong to, has personally helped over 500 veterans or their partners access benefits. Service officers are not paid, but their training and expenses are paid for by the poppy fund. A lot of MPs in this House did not appear to know what the poppy fund went to. That is where it goes, directly.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="45">(1145)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3855384">In a few weeks, Canadians will start wearing their poppies with pride. They know that the vast majority of those funds go directly to veterans support.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855385">Of the 600,000 to 700,000 veterans in Canada, 130,000 have case files of some sort at Veterans Affairs. Of that, only 7,500 have an assigned case manager. A case manager is assigned based on an assessment of a variety of needs, including the complexity of the case, the services or support the veteran has or does not have at home, and ongoing illnesses or addiction issues. All of these things are assessed, and a case manager is assigned. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855386">Our most complex cases number in the 7,500 to 8,000 range. We are providing in-home support for some of these veterans. A case manager can visit these veterans in their homes. Thanks to our changes, veterans can now visit up to 700 Service Canada and related offices, including joint personnel support units and mental health centres, to access the same level of service they can also get from a veterans services officer. They can also use the phone and the My VAC online account. We need to serve our veterans in a variety of ways, and we do.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855387">Too often there is discussion about money and it is said that we can never do enough for our veterans. I agree, but let us speak about those numbers for a moment. Today $4.7 billion more is being spent on veterans than when we came into office. The vast majority of that relates to direct benefits for soldiers who were injured in the Afghanistan conflict. We have made sure that they are constantly reviewed and improved. A supplement has been introduced for the permanent impairment class so that those veterans who will have a very difficult time transitioning out of uniform into civilian employment are being provided for with additional payments.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855388">The veterans affairs committee, in a good show of solidarity and of removing politics, came up with 14 recommendations on how to improve the new veterans charter. Many of those recommendations have already been acted on. Most important of these is the fact that a veteran will first stabilize and be assigned a proper VAC file manager before being released from the Canadian Forces. That is an important improvement. Another improvement is that certain benefits, particularly related to mental health, will be extended to families. In the coming weeks and months, more of those 14 recommendations will be acted on. I hope that all members of the committee, including a couple who spoke in the House before me, try to keep the politics removed from this.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855389">Interestingly, the new veterans charter was created by the last Liberal government but was implemented by the Conservative government. It needs to be a living document that is improved upon. It was improved a few years ago with the permanent impairment allowance supplement. Now it is being improved to address some of the shortcomings of the new veterans charter.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855390">My friend from <Affiliation DbId="170581" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> talked about the concept of a continuum of care. He would like to one day see all of these services housed under one administrative department. I agree wholeheartedly with him. This is not a partisan issue. Retired Senator Dallaire, the lieutenant-general my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170547" Type="2">Guelph</Affiliation> spoke about, supports this same approach, in principle.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855391">I will tell the House why it makes sense, and hopefully it is not a bridge too far. I enrolled in the Canadian Forces at 18. I was recruited. There is a department in the forces for recruiting. When I left, I was transferred to a different department. I left the uniform, and suddenly I was no longer part of the DND or Canadian Forces bureaucracy. I was transferred to a new one. That is not how they do it in the United Kingdom, where veterans services are part of defence services under the Ministry of Defence.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855392">In giving speeches across the country I have met veterans from the Devil's Brigade, World War II, and Korea who have complained about problems that were caused when they left the uniform and their records were transferred to Veterans Affairs. That gap needs to be closed. People should not fall through the cracks. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855393">I hope that the motion today about a continuum of care, brought forward by my friend from <Affiliation DbId="170581" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>, starts this dialogue so that we can reduce the number of people who may be falling through the cracks now. Hopefully, in the future, we will see all of this in one ministry so that from enrolment and recruitment to retirement and becoming a veteran it is all in one family.</ParaText>

His comments appear to contradict the findings of the standing committee and the very motion by the member for Edmonton Centre calling for further action. I would certainly agree that this is not a partisan issue and that all members in this place are proud to stand and speak on behalf of our Canadian veterans. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855396">Motion No. 532, tabled by the member for <Affiliation DbId="170581" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>, calls on the government to examine all possible options for a fully unified continuum of care for the men and women in uniform and veterans. He calls for the elimination of all unnecessary bureaucratic processes; the elimination of duplication and overlap; further improvements in care and support, particularly for seriously injured veterans; continued support for veterans' families; and strengthened connections between the Canadian Armed Forces, the Department of National Defence, and Veterans Affairs Canada. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855397">This motion, in perhaps a less specific way, appears to mirror the official opposition calls, as stated unanimously in June 2004 by the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs, for specified enhancements to the veterans charter and repeated calls by injured veterans for more long-term supportive services. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855398">While I commend the member for <Affiliation DbId="170581" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>, a retired and honoured armed forces member, for tabling this motion and for calling for greater action in support of Canadian war veterans, it is unclear if he is now mirroring the opposition's calls for action by the government. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855399">These questions arise: Is the member similarly decrying the wasted taxpayer dollars spent in forcing our veterans into a five-year court battle to end the clawback of the service income security insurance plan, or SISIP, benefits? Is he also now joining the opposition in supporting the RCMP call for the government to drop its court proceedings contesting the claim by the RCMP disabled veterans to end the clawback of their benefits? Third, is the member perhaps now regretting this past February having voted against the motion by the member for <Affiliation DbId="170160" Type="2">Châteauguay—Saint-Constant</Affiliation> calling for more government support for veterans and military mental health services? That motion stated:</ParaText><ParaText id="3855400"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That, in the opinion of the House, the men and women who bravely serve Canada in the armed forces should be able to count on the government for support in their time of need, and that the government should demonstrate this support by (a) immediately addressing the mental health crisis facing Canadian soldiers and veterans...(b) reversing its decision to close veterans' offices; and (c) prioritizing and concluding the over 50 outstanding boards of inquiry on military suicides.... </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855401">I was proud to stand in support of that motion by my colleague. It is clear that the member for <Affiliation DbId="170581" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> is proud of his role in the armed forces. Can we hope that he is now publicly joining our call for the government to support the government's sacred and fiduciary duty to our veterans, contrary to the position presented on behalf of the government in the Equitas court case?</ParaText><ParaText id="3855402">It is unclear if the intent of Motion No. 532 clause (c), which says, “further improve care and support, particularly for seriously injured veterans”, is intended to also include mental health conditions. We can hope so. If so, it is encouraging that the member is now speaking in support of calls for greater federal support for veterans suffering mental conditions as a result of their service and for suicide prevention interventions. It is also encouraging that the member has brought forward this motion seeking greater action on a continuum of care for our veterans. Action is needed, and it is needed now, to strengthen the veterans charter, as recommended by the standing committee. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855403">I fully support and stand behind the member's call to eliminate any unnecessary bureaucratic processes put in the way of timely access to veterans' benefits and supports. For those already suffering physical or mental challenges, the support should be front and centre and readily available in the community to facilitate a timely response. Certainly toll-free phone service is neither sufficient nor appropriate.</ParaText>

However, I am troubled that the member's response to some of the questions posed to him are that it would have to happen in a phased manner. Yet, here we are with the government projecting that there will be a surplus. Surely, this matter should be front and centre and somewhere high on the list of priorities for increasing services.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855406">The veterans charter is a step forward, but based on actual experience and the significant frustrations experienced by veterans, further actions are now required, as clarified by the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855407">The member for <Affiliation DbId="170581" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> has called for phased improvements. We would say that the ball is in the government's court.

It can also make services available in a more timely fashion in our veteran communities.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855408">The New Democrat calls for improved health support to our veterans are not new. In 2006, we called for the immediate elimination of the unfair reduction of the veterans disability pension benefit from the SISIP benefits. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855409">Sadly, the government opposed this action.

We are asking for an immediate response to the critical needs of our injured veterans, not reform over time.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855410">As per the standing committee, we must address the personal injuries of soldiers before they depart or are dismissed from the forces to civilian life. As many members have said, it is important to merge the veterans and military services and benefits as recommended by the committee but in an expeditious manner. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855411">There is a clear covenant and undertaking that when Canadian men and women serve in our armed forces and are sent off to war, we will ensure their care on their return, whether for physical injuries or mental disabilities, including PTSD. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855412">Canadians expect that the federal government will ensure that full benefits and services are provided in a timely manner as physical disability is often accompanied by emotional and mental health challenges.</ParaText>

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Lake" id="8472823"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170855" Type="18">Hon. Mike Lake (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3855419">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document>, the digital privacy act. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855420">The purpose of the digital privacy act would be to strengthen our private sector privacy laws and to increase protection for Canadians when they surf the web and shop online.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855421"> The digital privacy act would provide a foundation on which the government would hold businesses to account on behalf of consumers. It would establish a new framework and new rules for how private businesses handle, use, and collect the personal information of Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855422">This past April, the <Affiliation DbId="194622" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> launched Digital Canada 150, a comprehensive plan for Canada to take full advantage of the digital economy. It is a plan that has clear goals for Canada to be a competitively connected country by the time we celebrate our 150th anniversary in 2017.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855423"> Our government understands that when Canadians shop online or make purchases with their credit cards, they want their information to be safe. That is why we introduced the digital privacy act which would improve Canada's private sector privacy laws.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855424">It is the unfortunate reality, in today's digital age, that we need to be more and more wary of hackers and electronic data theft. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855425">Just this past year, businesses like Target, Home Depot and Kmart in the United States, had the credit card information of millions of people lost to hackers.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855426">It is surprising, but under our current rules, it is not mandatory for companies to disclose the theft of this information to their clients.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855427">Under the digital privacy act, companies would now be required to tell their clients when their personal information has been lost or stolen.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855428">In addition, businesses would now need to report these harmful breaches to the Privacy Commissioner. Further to this, companies would need to keep a record of all privacy breaches that have occurred within their organization and the Privacy Commissioner would now have the ability to request information on any of these breaches.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855429">The digital privacy act would also set out hefty penalties for companies that deliberately break the rules and try to cover up a data breach. Organizations would face fines of up to $100,000 per client they fail to notify that the data breach has occurred.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855430">Let me now outline a few more ways the bill would help protect Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855431">The digital privacy act would introduce stronger rules to protect vulnerable Canadians, like children and seniors, when they surf the web.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855432">Many websites are focused on children, like educational online playgrounds or learning websites. Many times these websites, for marketing purposes, ask to collect personal information from the person using the website.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855433">Under the digital privacy act, we would establish stronger rules and clarify that the wording that these companies use to request personal information needs to be simple enough that a child, or any target audience, could understand.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855434">This means that if the consent required is too difficult for a child to understand, the consent would not be valid.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855435">In addition, the digital privacy act would introduce limited and targeted exceptions where personal information could be shared without an individual's consent.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855436">An unfortunate factor in our society is financial abuse. Currently, banks and financial institutions do not have the ability to alert the appropriate authorities when they suspect a senior is a victim of financial abuse.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855437">The digital privacy act would now give an exception to banks and financial institutions to be able to alert law enforcement when they suspect someone is a victim of financial abuse.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855438">Finally, the digital privacy act would give the Privacy Commissioner new powers to help enforce the law and make companies accountable when the rules are broken.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855439">The Privacy Commissioner would now be able to negotiate compliance agreements with organizations that break the law. This would keep organizations accountable to their commitments to correct privacy issues.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855440">In addition, the commissioner would now have one year, instead of 45 days, to take organizations to court if they do not play by the rules.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855441">The digital privacy act would also give the commissioner a new ability to name and shame organizations that are not co-operating either with an investigation or with their commitments to fix their privacy issues. This would also allow Canadians to become more knowledgeable about issues that affect their privacy.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855442">As technology and the marketplace evolve, we need to be more and more aware of how we can protect ourselves and our information.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855443">The digital privacy act is common sense legislation that would help update our private sector privacy laws and would hold organizations to account when they lose personal information.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855444">The Privacy Commissioner would now have increased power to help enforce the law and would also hold companies to account when they do not play by the rules.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855445">I look forward to the continued debate in this House and to when the bill is referred to the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology where we will hear from expert witnesses as we continue to discuss how to best protect Canadians in our digital world.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855446">I hope all hon. members will join me in supporting Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document>.</ParaText>

While I have numerous concerns about Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document>, I still plan on supporting today's motion because I think that we can work together to improve the bill. However, that does not mean that I support the bill, and I must make that distinction.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855464">As parliamentarians, we have been elected to work together and find effective solutions. That is what I am hoping to do today. I want to reach out to the government in the hopes of improving this bill because some of the elements are a step in the right direction.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855465"> As the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170347" Type="2">Chicoutimi—Le Fjord</Affiliation> said, I introduced Bill <Document DbId="6251848" Type="4">C-475</Document> in the House. That bill was designed to make significant changes to the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, PIPEDA, to ensure it reflected the reality of the digital era. Unfortunately, the Conservatives voted against it. There could have been better protections in place, but we were unable to work together. This time around, I hope that will be possible.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855466">It is extremely important that PIPEDA be updated, since it has not been updated since the very first iPod was introduced. Technology has evolved. Facebook did not even exist yet at the time. Things have really changed, and the law must reflect the current reality. This bill is a good first step, but it does not go far enough. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855467">For instance, it is important to introduce a mandatory system for notifying users of data losses and data breaches. However, the model proposed by the government is subjective: organizations can decide whether the data breach is significant enough to report. In some situations, these organizations will not have the best means or knowledge to do this, especially the really small organizations. Is it really in their interest to disclose such data breaches? Probably not.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855468">Bill <Document DbId="6251848" Type="4">C-475</Document> proposed a model that was objective. That is one aspect that must absolutely be improved in order to better protect Canadians' privacy, and I hope this change can be made in committee. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855469">It is important to implement a system that will ensure greater compliance with PIPEDA. With international digital mega-corporations in the picture, our laws are too frequently broken because there are currently no penalties. That is why we need a system of penalties to enforce corporate compliance with PIPEDA and Canadian privacy laws.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855470">Unfortunately, Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document> does not go far enough in this respect. It creates the option of putting together a committee that will act in good faith. Sometimes everyone acts in good faith and is happy, but that is not always how things work.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855471">The commissioner has to be able to issue orders earlier in the process, but that is not what the government has proposed. That is what I proposed in Bill <Document DbId="6251848" Type="4">C-475</Document>, and that is another change that will have to be made to Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document> before we can support it.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855472">However, what really bothers me about this bill is the provision that would allow organizations to share personal information without a warrant and without the consent of the individual concerned. That is a huge problem. Even though this bill is called the digital privacy act, it contains a provision that could really interfere with the protection of privacy. I find that deeply contradictory. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="15">(1215)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3855473">It is also extremely important to point out that between the time that this bill was drafted and the debate today, the Supreme Court reiterated in its ruling that information such as data from Internet service providers on their clients, including their IP addresses, email addresses, names, telephone numbers, and so forth, are personal information and cannot be obtained without a warrant. Obviously, I am paraphrasing, but that is more or less what the Supreme Court ruled.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855474">I have major reservations about the constitutionality of this provision of the bill. I asked the government to reassess it and withdraw it. Unfortunately, my request was not favourably received. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855475">I think we could work together during review in committee on withdrawing this provision, which may violate the Canadian Constitution. I hope that is why the Conservatives want to send this bill to committee.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855476">Obviously this is a Senate bill. During review in committee, a number of witnesses shared their concerns over this very provision. The Privacy Commissioner said the following in a brief:</ParaText><ParaText id="3855477"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Allowing such disclosures to prevent potential fraud [as provided for in clauses 7(3)(<I>a</I>.1) and 7(3)(<I>a</I>.2)] may open the door to widespread disclosures and routine sharing of personal information among organizations on the grounds that this information might be useful to prevent future fraud. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3855478">Indeed, the government wants to protect personal information, but allowing access to that information without a warrant, without consent, without any judicial oversight and without transparency is very problematic.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855479">On many occasions, the government has used PIPEDA and its loopholes to call on Internet service providers and ask for Canadians' personal information. Why? We do not know. We do not even know exactly how many requests have been made, because this information is not available to the public. However, based on what the Privacy Commissioner revealed, we know that in a single year, government agencies made at least 1.2 million requests to Internet service providers to obtain personal information about their customers. That is a huge problem.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855480">The government could have taken this opportunity to truly protect Canadians' privacy and to fix the loopholes in PIPEDA that allow this kind of information to be transmitted without legal oversight, without consent and without any transparency. It could have done that. I hope it will do so during the study in committee. That is very important. I am just making a suggestion.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855481">We are debating the motion today. We are prepared to agree to study this bill before it passes at second reading, as is usually the case. I hope that this will be a gesture of good faith, and that the Conservatives will take this opportunity to fix the loopholes in PIPEDA and to eliminate the clause allowing organizations to share information without a warrant. We cannot support a bill that contains provisions that violate Canadians' privacy.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Together, these two bills strengthen the parallel system for accessing personal information. Of course, there is the traditional system under which a warrant is needed to obtain personal information about someone. However, as a result of flaws in the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, there is also a parallel system under which a government agency can simply pick up the phone, call an Internet service provider and ask for information about that company's clients. That is something that the government does not seem to want to correct. In fact, the government wants to do the opposite. It wants to increase its ability to do this sort of thing by giving itself legal immunity under Bill C-13 and by now allowing organizations to share Canadians' personal information among themselves without consent and without a warrant.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I offer a computer security course for seniors at a seniors centre in my riding. This helps me to see just how concerned people are about the risks they face in the digital age. These individuals do not necessarily know what happens when they enter their personal information into the vortex of Facebook, Google or any other network. People often think about the two examples that I just mentioned, but this goes even further than that. Phishing emails are often sent to people who do not necessarily know how to distinguish between a phishing email and a legitimate email.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855487">I want to share some key figures that show just how concerned people are about this issue. A total of 70% of Canadians feel less protected than they did 10 years ago, 97% of Canadians would like organizations to inform them in the event of a data breach, and 91% of Canadians say that they are concerned or extremely concerned about the protection of personal information. That is huge.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855488">The NDP has taken action on this file. We introduced Bill <Document DbId="6251848" Type="4">C-475</Document>. On one opposition day, we moved a motion to close the gaps in the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act and to enhance the transparency of the parallel system for information sharing between Internet service providers and government agencies.

The government chose to have it introduced in the Senate and brought in through the back way.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855494">On this side of the House, we will support sending the bill to committee. We have some very serious concerns when we combine the impact of Bills <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document> and <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document>, but in order to ensure that we are being open and fair on this issue, that we understand it thoroughly, and that it does keep Canadians' interests in mind, we will support it going to committee. Hopefully, at that point, we will have sufficient time to get answers to the various questions of concern.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855495">We are back discussing the Conservatives' type of approach, which is that one is either with them or against them. If we vote against the bill, it means that we are not interested in privacy rights, and if we vote for the bill, there is another side. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855496">It is another one of those bills that continue to be very divisive in the House at a time when these are the kinds of privacy issues that we should be trying to work out together. I do hope that when we get to the industry committee, we have a good group there so that we can do some serious work in a non-partisan way. Maybe we can strengthen the bill in the end, by listening to some of the experts who have sincere concerns about it.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855497">I do not mean to start out on a negative, but the truth is simple. We all need to be part of the debate today.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855498">The way that the government looks at personal information, protection and privacy has already been subject to a Supreme Court ruling, and we have to give consideration to that. It is one thing to play partisan politics in the House and think that we are playing to the political base, but it is important that we listen to the rulings of the Supreme Court on privacy issues.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855499">There are clearly those who have tried to make it sound like anyone who does not support the government is supportive of criminals. We have heard that before. However, the discussion is not as simple as that. The government's record on information protection has been embarrassingly negligent, so forgive me if I am not convinced that the recent scheme is worth passing without intense scrutiny.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855500">We should all remember the matter of that lost hard drive, which held the social insurance numbers, medical records, birthdates, education levels, occupations and disability payment information of about 5,000 Canadians. That was lost. Perhaps the government wishes to plead incompetence on that side, or maybe it was an accident. We always like to be fair, so maybe it was an accident. Either way, the way that the government manages information needs extra study, which is why I am speaking on this today.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855501">We are now looking at Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document>, but one cannot look at Bill S-4 without considering the implications of its companion legislation. Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document>, which is also before the House this week, would make it a crime to transmit pictures without consent, and it would remove barriers to getting unwanted pictures removed from the Internet. The stated intent of the bill is positive, but I have serious concerns with the provisions that would grant immunity to telecom companies that provide subscriber information to the police without even so much as a warrant.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855502">I raise the issue, given that last April, Canada's interim privacy commissioner revealed that nine telecommunications companies received an average of 1.2 million requests from federal enforcement bodies for private customer information every year. That amounts to nearly 3,300 requests each and every day.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855503">Those are shocking numbers, and it could be argued that the bill has, in effect, already been rendered unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Last June, in an unrelated case, the court declared that law enforcement requires a warrant to get even basic subscriber data. Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document> would allow private companies to share telecom subscriber data between themselves, something that would seem to contravene the Supreme Court's ruling.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855504">How could that possibly be? Did the Senate miss this detail or did it fail to consider the implications of the Supreme Court's ruling? The truth is that the Senate passed Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document> just days after the Supreme Court ruling, without even studying the implications. I guess the government is less concerned with that than pushing ahead with both Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document>. It is a lack of respect for the Supreme Court as well as Parliament.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3855505">Put simply, the legislation represents a paradigm shift in the way we deal with the release of private information. Traditionally, privacy laws outline the rules and procedures needed to protect information and personal data, but in this case, the legislation sets out circumstances under which that material can be released. Clearly, the implications of this change have not been fully considered and should be explored by the committee prior to passing final judgment on the pros and cons of the measures contained within Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document>. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855506">My party and I will be voting to send it to committee for what we would hope is a thorough examination. Liberals want to ensure that law enforcement officials have access to the information they require to keep us safe, but a blank cheque approach is inappropriate. A blank cheque approach has been ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court and promises limited success in advancing societal protections when considered holistically. Why not take the time to do this right?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855507">In a world where crimes involving data theft, identity fraud and online stalking are on the rise, protecting data is crucial. Data is not simply information. It is a commodity, it is power, and it is the doorway into the private lives of so many people. Liberals are deeply concerned that the government's commitment to safeguarding the personal information and privacy of Canadians is less than absolute. I am not suggesting the government is malicious. I do not believe that, but I fear it just does not understand the implications of Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855508">Notwithstanding certain faulty or short-sighted legislative measures introduced by the government in the past, Canada is facing a genuine paradigm shift with respect to privacy protection, but privacy protection cannot be taken lightly. Whether protecting personal information from unscrupulous business interests, Internet stalkers and identity thieves, or rogue states bent on economic espionage, information security is crucial. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855509">With these concerns in mind and as a leap of faith and confidence that our committee will have a chance to thoroughly examine this, I will be voting in favour of sending the bill to committee for further study. However, in return, I am also asking the minister to allow the committee to do its work honestly and freely without the involvement of the leadership so that the committee is allowed to really examine it thoroughly to ensure that if this goes forward, it goes forward with what I would hope would be unanimous support in the House on something as important as Canada's privacy rights. I believe that is quite doable, because at the end of the day we have the same objectives, to ensure Canadian privacy laws are strong and that Canadians are protected.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Bill S-4 is an essential part of Digital Canada 150, our Conservative government's plan to confirm our leadership in Canada in the digital age.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855525"> Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document> proposes a number of important changes to the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, PIPEDA, that will strengthen the protection of Canadians' privacy. The digital privacy act would also set new rules on how personal information is collected, used, and disclosed. Most importantly, this legislation requires organizations to tell Canadians if their personal information has been compromised. Companies who fail to inform Canadians about privacy breaches would be subject to severe fines for breaking the rules.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855526">The <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">digital privacy act</Document> is a balanced approach that protects Canadians' personal information. It allows for information sharing when the law has been broken. This balanced approach confirms our Conservative government's respect for personal privacy.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855527">Let us now address any misunderstanding by individuals who have not read our legislation, particularly when things are read into this bill that clearly do not exist, such as claims that this bill expands warrantless disclosure </ParaText><ParaText id="3855528">When all parties in this House agreed to enact PIPEDA over a decade ago, we recognized that there were certain limited circumstances where an individual's right to privacy should be balanced to assist the public interest. For example, PIPEDA ensures that the right to freedom of expression is respected by allowing for information to be collected and used for journalistic or artistic purposes. Another example is that PIPEDA allows people to freely share information with their lawyer, even if it includes the personal information of another individual, to ensure the proper administration of justice.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855529">PIPEDA allows private sector organizations to disclose individuals' personal information in order to conduct investigations that help protect Canadians from wrongdoing. This provision has always existed within PIPEDA. Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document> does not expand this practice. Rather, our legislation would place tight rules and strict limits on when and how private organizations could share Canadians' personal information.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855530">I would like to emphasize to the House the role of private organizations and how they can play an important role in creating a safe and secure society for Canadians. Consider, for example, self-regulating professional associations, like the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, the Law Society of Alberta, or the Association of Professional Engineers of Nova Scotia. These bodies have the legal authority to investigate their members and take disciplinary action where required. This may be because a physician is performing procedures that he or she is not qualified to perform; it may be because a lawyer is charging inappropriate fees to clients; or, it may be because an engineer is approving the drawings for a new building without actually reviewing them. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855531">It is not difficult to see there is a real public interest in making sure that these professional associations have the ability to investigate complaints against their members and to ensure they are meeting high professional standards that benefit Canadian society. In order to do so, investigators must be able to obtain personal information that is protected under PIPEDA. For example, when investigating a complaint against a lawyer, the law society may request that the lawyer's firm provides access to his or her client lists, financial records, or calendar. All of these records could include personal information which normally could not be disclosed to investigators without the individual's consent.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3855532">Under PIPEDA as it now stands, investigators who want to access personal information without consent must be listed as an investigative body by Industry Canada. This involves coming forward to the department and justifying the need to access the information. This is an onerous process for organizations and for the government. For example, a simple name change by an investigative organization may lead to a year-long regulatory process before the change is reflected in the law.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855533">During the first statutory review of PIPEDA, the House of Commons committee recommended that PIPEDA be amended to change the rules for private investigations and adopt a system that is consistent with both Alberta and British Columbia. Under these regimes, there is a general exception to consent for information sharing purposes of private sector investigations.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855534">In essence, these provincial laws regulate the activity of private investigations rather than the organizations who conduct them. Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document> would introduce similar rules to those that already exist in Alberta and British Columbia. By placing tight rules and stricter limits on when and how private organizations can share a Canadian's personal information, our government is complying with the recommendations made by the all-party committee.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855535">Upon Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document> being enacted, private organizations would be required to abide by four strict rules when sharing a Canadian's private information for the purposes of an investigation. It is important for Canadians to appreciate that despite these rules, private organization information sharing is voluntary. These rules only apply in the event that an organization agrees to disclose information for the purposes of an investigation. These rules are as follows:</ParaText><ParaText id="3855536">First, the information can only be provided to another private organization, not the government and not law enforcement. Second, the information that is requested must be relevant to the investigation. For example, there is little reason that a social insurance number would be released for the purposes of investigating professional misconduct. Third, the investigation must pertain to a contravention of the law or breach of a contract. Finally, it must be reasonable to believe that seeking the consent of the individual to disclose the information would compromise the investigation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855537">To be clear, organizations that share information would continue to be subject to all other requirements of PIPEDA. The Privacy Commissioner and the Federal Court will continue to have oversight on this matter, and if an organization is found to be using the exemption provisions where it is not necessary, action would be taken by the commissioner or by the court.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855538">The Conservative government always takes the privacy of all Canadians very seriously. Our fundamental beliefs, such as democracy, the right to own private property, and the right of freedom of association, are complementary. They are why we introduced the digital privacy act, to protect Canadians' private information in the digital age.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855539">I look forward to the remainder of the debate and working with the opposition for all Canadians on how we can best protect individuals in the digital world.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It flies in the face of democracy.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855554">As my colleague for <Affiliation DbId="170294" Type="2">Nickel Belt</Affiliation> pointed out, if the bill is so important, why is it coming from the Senate rather than the government?</ParaText><ParaText id="3855555">The Conservatives have formed government for nearly eight years now, and they are finally getting to this matter. Hacking is not new. Invasion of privacy is not new. Why were these changes not brought before us years ago?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855556">I would also like to address the fact that the bill is being referred to committee before second reading. I actually applaud the government for this move, but my next question is to ask why this did not happen before. Why was this approach not taken regarding electoral reform? Why was this approach not taken regarding some first nations' issues that have come before the House so that we would have a broader scope of study within committee and an attempt at working together?</ParaText><ParaText id="3855557">When the parliamentary secretary first rose to speak on the bill, he said that bringing the bill to committee before second reading would help to ensure that the best bill would be brought forward. I think it demonstrates that perhaps the current government is not always interested in bringing the best bill forward, because we are three years in, and this is the first time that the Conservatives have chosen this approach.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855558">We have had numerous instances of bills being brought forward by the government and then being overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada. We potentially could have prevented that from happening had we taken this approach with other bills or had the government listened to opposition amendments and suggestions to make sure that the bills conformed with the law.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855559">Traditionally, of course, adoption at second reading amounts to approval of the principle of the bill by the House. This can often restrict the committee's ability to make changes and amendments, which is something we would avoid with this bill. I hope that the industry committee takes the proper amount of time to study this issue before referring it back to the House. I certainly think the capacity is within the industry committee to do so. We have an opportunity to fix the parts of the bill before us that are lacking.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855560"> With regard to the rationale given by the member across the way for some intrusions into privacy, it is not so cut and dried. It is not a black-and-white issue. These are issues that need to be explored further, and the committee setting is the appropriate place to do that. The question is, will that in fact happen?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855561">Most of us are surprised and a little confused as to why the government is taking this approach. The Conservatives have had many opportunities to use this approach in the past, but have never chosen to. It will be very interesting to follow the proceedings in the industry committee to see where this goes. Is it because government members want to make substantive changes that their brethren in the Senate missed, avoided, or did not put in?</ParaText><ParaText id="3855562">Perhaps that is why the Conservatives are bringing it forward, but only time will tell. One of the very important lessons I have learned here is not to believe it until it happens, which can be said of so many different things we do in the House. There are a lot of rumours out there, but it would be good to try to stick to fact as much as possible.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855563">Since the committee will have the opportunity to properly consider and make necessary changes to the bill, we are supporting the motion to send the bill back to committee. I think it makes a lot of sense, and it is an approach that should be used more often.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp>
							<ParaText id="3855564"> That this was done without a warrant raises questions. I would hate for court cases to be moving forward in which evidence might be thrown out because warrants were not obtained. The result would be an increased cost for the judicial procedure, and there is the potential as well for letting some criminals off the hook when they should be facing prosecution. We definitely need to beef up those aspects.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855565">There is a provision within the bill that would make it easier for companies to share personal information without warrant or consent from clients and with no proper oversight mechanisms in place. Following a recent decision from the Supreme Court of Canada, this provision will most likely be considered unconstitutional.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855566">The government must respect the Supreme Court ruling by withdrawing all clauses relating to warrantless disclosure of personal information from the bill. That is a very reasonable position. Canadians would expect that if law enforcement agencies are seeking people's personal information, they would have to follow a process, and obtaining warrants is a very important part of our system. It has to be proven that the information is needed before a warrant is obtained. That is a minimum standard when seeking this information. Currently, with these warrantless provisions, requests can be made without any oversight. That is troubling to many Canadians who are concerned about their privacy.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855567">We are also concerned about many of the negative consequences that certain provisions in this bill might provide. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855568">It is also interesting to note that the bill was largely inspired by Bill <Document DbId="6251848" Type="4">C-475</Document>, which was tabled in 2012 by my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170229" Type="2">Terrebonne—Blainville</Affiliation>. Rather than wasting time and avoiding creating better protections for Canadians, the Conservatives should have simply supported the NDP's bill, which would have done more to protect Canadians' privacy.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855569">Privacy has been a thorny, low-priority issue for the Conservatives, who have been incapable of adequately protecting Canadians' privacy.

I support the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855584">The purpose of the <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">digital privacy act</Document> is to strengthen the rules for the safeguarding of Canadians' personal information when they shop online or surf the web. The digital privacy act would amend the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, more commonly known as PIPEDA, which provides a legal framework for how personal information must be handled in the context of commercial activities.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855585">Last April, our Conservative government introduced the Digital Canada 150, an ambitious plan for Canada to take full advantage of the digital economy as we plan to celebrate our 150th anniversary in 2017. Digital Canada 150 has five pillars and 39 new initiatives that will allow Canada to be a leading nation in the digital domain. One of the most important pillars in Digital Canada 150 is the “protecting Canadians” pillar, which is what we are talking about today. The <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">digital privacy act</Document> would introduce new amendments and stronger rules to help protect Canadians' personal information.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855586">As we live in an increasingly digital age, the need to protect our personal information becomes stronger. We use credit cards to purchase items online. We use the Internet to browse websites that may ask us for our personal information, and so on. Just last month, Home Depot was the victim of a massive data breach. The information of 56 million debit and credit cardholders was stolen.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855587">It is surprising that, under the current law, it is not mandatory for companies to disclose to their clients that they have been the victims of hackers or if they have lost personal information. That means that if someone's credit card information was stolen, under current laws, that person may never know his or her information was compromised. It may be surprising to some, but it is not currently mandatory that companies inform their clients if their personal information has been lost or stolen.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855588">Under the <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">digital privacy act</Document>, however, if a company fails to notify its clients of a data breach where their information has been compromised, it can face a fine of up to $100,000 for every client it fails to notify. In addition, companies are now required to keep a record of all data breaches, and all documents must be handed over to the Privacy Commissioner upon his or her request.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855589">The <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">digital privacy act</Document> would also put in place new provisions that would allow the limited disclosure of personal information when it is in the public interest. One such example is the unfortunate reality of financial abuse. As it stands now, banks and other financial institutions are prevented from reporting suspected financial abuse to the proper authorities. The <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">digital privacy act</Document> would give the exception to allow banks to alert law enforcement when they suspect that a senior is being financially abused.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855590">The Canadian Bankers Association has endorsed these amendments. It said:</ParaText><ParaText id="3855591"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">We were pleased to see that Bill S-4 includes amendments that would give banks and other organizations greater ability to assist their clients to avoid financial abuse. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3855592">As our society spends increasingly more time online and on the Internet, it is important that we have the proper safeguards in place for our children. Educational websites and virtual playgrounds are becoming more and more popular with young children. Sometimes, for marketing purposes, these websites will ask for the users' personal information. Under the <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">digital privacy act</Document>, there is a clearer set of rules for when companies ask to collect personal information from a child. The request for information now must be written in a way that a child can understand. If the wording is too complicated for a child to understand, the consent is not valid.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855593">The <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">digital privacy act</Document> would also ensure that online privacy laws reflect the realities of business, such as allowing businesses to share employees' contact information and information necessary to manage an employment relationship. Businesses also need to be able to use the information employees produce at work as well as the information necessary to conduct due diligence during a business transaction such as a merger.</ParaText>

The bill before us takes steps to align our privacy rules with provincial laws.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855595">The bill before us is a much needed update to privacy laws in Canada.

As members know, today's debate turns not precisely on Bill S-4 but on a motion to refer the bill to committee before second reading.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855612">The concerns that I will raise with respect to the bill itself, which go as far as to challenge the constitutionality of the bill, would likely be fatal to the bill at second reading, but we need not concern ourselves with that today. We need not arrive at a conclusion about how fatal these flaws are or how injurious they are to the bill. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855613">The motion before us today would allow us to visit the scope and principle of the bill at committee and make, as required, amendments to those very principles and scope of the bill. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855614">Today, I would argue that this motion warrants support, so that we have the flexibility to properly study, examine and propose amendments to the bill at committee before the principle and scope are set.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855615"> Let me set out a few reasons why this is particularly important in these circumstances and relating to this particular legislation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855616">First, let me address the issue of public opinion that sets the context in which this bill and more broadly the issue of privacy concerns exist. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855617">According to a survey of Canadians on issues related to privacy protection conducted last year, 70% of Canadians feel less protected than they did 10 years ago; only 13% of Canadians believe that companies take their privacy seriously; 97% of Canadians say they would like organizations to let them know when breaches of personal information actually occur; 80% of Canadians say they would like the stiffest possible penalties to protect their personal information; and 91% of Canadian respondents were very or extremely concerned about the protection of privacy.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855618">The current government cannot absolve itself from contributing to this level of public concern about privacy issues. It is not just a matter of legislative lethargy; that is, it is not just about the fact that we are well past the five year mark for the conduct of a mandatory review of the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, an act that is by now well behind international standards and has failed to keep up with technological advancements in this digital age. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855619">Part of the issue here is that the current government has itself repeatedly demonstrated insufficient care for the personal privacy of Canadians through its own conduct. I would point to the fact that in one year alone, under the current <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s watch, government agencies secretly made more than 1.2 million requests to telecommunications companies for personal information, without warrant or proper oversight. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855620">It is a government with a seemingly insatiable appetite and perhaps an addiction to Canadians' personal information. It is a government that needs to be constrained by effective legislation that protects the privacy and personal information of Canadians. It is a government that has no credibility on this subject matter.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855621"> This is evident in the legislation that the Conservatives have defeated in this House. In 2012, our NDP digital issues critic, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170229" Type="2">Terrebonne—Blainville</Affiliation>, put forward Bill <Document DbId="6251848" Type="4">C-475</Document>, a bill to amend the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act. It would have applied similar online data protection standards that exist in Quebec's personal information protection act. For example, Bill C-475 would have given the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada the power to issue orders following an investigation. The Conservatives defeated that bill at second reading. They also defeated our NDP opposition day motion on May 5 last year. That motion simply called on the government to close loopholes in existing legislation that currently allowed the sharing of personal information without warrant. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855622">The current government's disregard for private and personal information is also evident by the legislation that it has brought forward.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3855623">Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document>, the government's cyberbullying law, includes lawful access provisions that would expand warrantless disclosure of information to law enforcement by giving immunity from any liability for companies that hold the information of Canadians to disclose it without a warrant. This makes it more likely that companies would hand over information without a warrant as there are no risks that they would face criminal or civil penalties for such conduct.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855624">There is a thread here that runs through the government's own efforts to access the personal and private information of Canadians through to their conduct and voting record in this place. It goes against the interests and concerns of Canadians and denies the wishes of Canadians for greater protection of their personal and private information.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855625">In other words, the issue before us goes to the principles underlying this bill. They need to be examined and amended at committee. For example, while Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document> would make it mandatory to declare the loss or breach of personal information for the organizations in the private sector and penalize organizations that do not fulfill this obligation, the proposed criteria for mandatory disclosure remains subjective. It would allow the organizations themselves to assess whether “it is reasonable in the circumstances to believe that the breach creates a real risk of significant harm to an individual”.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855626">More and most problematically still, Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document> would add exceptions under which personal information may be collected, used or disclosed without an individual's consent. The bill would make it easier for organizations to share personal information with each other without the consent of individuals if the organizations are engaged in a process leading to a “prospective” business transaction. In other words, under certain circumstances, the bill allows personal information of one organization's clients to be shared with another organization without the consent or knowledge of those individuals. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855627">Here we run into some significant problems with this bill. The amendments proposed contradict the very foundation of the act they seek to amend and serve to defeat what the Supreme Court called in R. v. Spencer the act's “general prohibition on the disclosure of personal information without consent”. As the Supreme Court said in that recent decision, “PIPEDA is a statute whose purpose is to increase the protection of personal information”.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855628">The Supreme Court, in R. v. Spencer, got to the heart of the issue here, understanding what the government has failed to understand about the issue of informational privacy in the digital age. It is worth quoting at length here. It stated:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855629"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Informational privacy is often equated with secrecy or confidentiality, and also includes the related but wider notion of control over, access to and use of information. However, particularly important in the context of Internet usage is the understanding of privacy as anonymity. The identity of a person linked to their use of the Internet must be recognized as giving rise to a privacy interest beyond that inherent in the person’s name, address and telephone number found in the subscriber information. Subscriber information, by tending to link particular kinds of information to identifiable individuals may implicate privacy interests relating to an individual’s identity as the source, possessor or user of that information. Some degree of anonymity is a feature of much Internet activity and depending on the totality of the circumstances, anonymity may be the foundation of a privacy interest that engages constitutional protection against unreasonable search and seizure. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3855630">So, from subscriber information, the Supreme Court has connected that information through to search and seizure.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855631"> We have at least before us a major concern with the principles of this act, but seemingly too a bill that is simply unconstitutional. Leaving aside for the moment this latter issue, let me suggest by way of conclusion that if there is something in Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document> that is salvageable, it can only be so if this bill moves to committee before this House sets in concrete the principles and scope of this bill, and limits the kinds of amendments that can arise out of committee post second reading.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

When the industry minister released Digital Canada 150, our government's plan to guide Canada's digital future, he set out clear goals to put our country at the forefront of the digital economy. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855647">One of the five pillars of this ambitious plan is “protecting Canadians”. In order to realize the full benefits of the digital plan and the digital world, Canadians must have confidence that their online activities are secure and that their online privacy is protected through strong measures like the digital privacy act.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855648">This government is taking concrete action to make sure that Canadians and their families are protected from online threats. Protecting Canadians online is particularly important when we consider the most vulnerable segments of our society. Indeed, as the Internet becomes present in virtually every aspect of our economy, and our children's homework, it is also becoming an essential element in our children's lives.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855649">A recently released survey conducted last year by MediaSmarts, a charitable organization dedicated to digital and media literacy, revealed that in 2013, 99% of Canadian students were able to access the Internet outside of their school. When online, students play games, download music, television shows and movies, and socialize with their friends and family. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855650">The survey reveals that over 30% of students in grades 4 to 6 have Facebook accounts, and that by grade 11, my daughter's year, 95% of students have an account. However, with this increased online presence comes increased risk. As we have seen, young people can unfortunately become targets of online intimidation and abuse. This government has acted to protect our children from cyberbullying and other similar threats. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855651">In addition to responding to the very real and harmful threats related to cyberbullying, this government is also acting to protect the privacy of minors and other vulnerable individuals through proposed amendments to the digital privacy act.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855652">In our modern digital economy, our children must be able to go online in a safe and secure way if they are to develop the skills they will need later to find jobs in the digital marketplace. The online world has the potential to provide considerable benefits for our children's education and development, and it can greatly enrich their social lives. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855653">At the same time, going online can expose children to privacy risks. For example, minors can be subject to aggressive behavioural marketing tactics, or they could have their personal data collected and shared without truly understanding what is being done. There is the potential for long-term privacy consequences.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855654">The digital privacy act includes an amendment to Canada's private sector privacy law to strengthen the requirements around the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information, which will increase the level of protection for vulnerable Canadians such as children. Specifically, the digital privacy act clarifies that when a company is seeking permission to collect, use, or disclose personal information from a specific group of individuals such as children, then the company must make sure that an average person, such as a child in that group, would be able to understand what is going to happen with the information.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855655">An example is the best way to illustrate how the proposed amendment will work. Imagine, for example, an educational website that is designed primarily for elementary school children. Under the proposed amendment, any request by that website to collect, use, or disclose personal information would need to be worded in such a way that it is understandable by the average elementary school student. This not only includes making sure that the wording and language used in the request is age appropriate, but that the request itself is appropriate as well. If it is not reasonable to expect that the average elementary-aged child would understand the purpose and consequences of them clicking “okay”, then under the digital privacy act the company would not have valid consent.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3855656">Minors under the age of majority are more vulnerable and require additional protections. At the same time, privacy protection for children must reflect their level of maturity and psychological development. It must respect that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855657">That is why our government has ensured that the flexibility inherent to the act which allows the application of contextual privacy protections is reflected in our proposed amendment. The ability of teenagers to understand what is being done with personal information and their ability to make decisions about what they will and will not agree to is completely different from what elementary school children are capable of.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855658">As they age, minors become more able to make sound decisions about themselves and what is being done with their personal information. Therefore, a website directed, for example, to grade 12 students, should not explain what it intends to do with information and seek consent in the same way that an educational website for elementary school students would. The process is similar; the means are different.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855659">The proposed amendment adjusts for this difference by focusing on what is reasonable to expect of the group of individuals being targeted by the company's product or service.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855660">The former interim privacy commissioner strongly supported this proposed amendment when speaking to the Senate committee that was studying the bill last spring. This is what the Office of the Privacy Commissioner said in its written submission to that committee:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855661"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">We think this is an important and valuable amendment that will clarify PIPEDA’s consent requirements. By requiring organizations to make a greater effort to explain why they are collecting personal information and how it will be used, this proposed amendment should help make consent more meaningful for all individuals, particularly for young people for whom the digital world is an integral part of their daily lives. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3855662">As an added protection, PIPEDA has always recognized that parents or other authorized representatives have the right to provide consent on behalf of an individual, including children. Indeed, the responsibility and commitment to protect the privacy of children and other vulnerable Canadians is absolutely a shared one. Parents, governments, educators, as well as charities in the private sector, all have a central role to play in protecting the online privacy of our children.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855663">The government firmly believes that digital literacy and skills are at the core of what is needed for individuals to succeed in today's online economy. Understanding by parents, educators, and children of the relevance and importance of protecting online privacy is a central component of digital literacy.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855664">The government supports the role that the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada is playing in educating Canada's youth about the importance of online privacy and helping them to not only understand the impact that online services and applications can have on their privacy but also helping them make wise, smart decisions.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855665">For example, the office of the commissioner created a graphic novel called <I>Social Smarts: Privacy, the Internet and You</I>. It was designed to help young Canadians better understand online privacy issues. They have also created tools to support parents and educators as they seek to protect children's online privacy. A discussion guide and privacy activity sheets have been developed to help them work with children to explore and understand privacy risks associated with social networking, mobile devices, texting, and online gaming.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855666">The government is committed to protecting the privacy of Canadians. The digital privacy act takes concrete action to protect the most vulnerable members of our society, and that includes our children. At the same time, this legislation respects the growth of our children as they approach adulthood. It is measured and graduated because of that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855667">I hope all hon. members will join me in supporting this very important bill.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

					<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Scott" id="8472955"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="181257" Type="2">Mr. Craig Scott (Toronto—Danforth, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3855682">Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to address this motion by the government to have Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document> go to committee before second reading, which is a rare event in the House. This is a procedure that was made possible for the first time in 1994 amendments. I believe it stemmed from the 1982 McGrath committee's report that said that committees should more often be used at the early stages of legislation to make sure that things are caught and that a wide variety of perspectives are taken into account in drafting legislation and, frankly, to make the role of MPs more meaningful than is often the case when a bill is studied only after second reading in committee. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855683">As we know, in committee after second reading, and after hearing any amount of testimony from witnesses that could suggest serious problems with a bill, the amendments are often extremely constrained by the rule that they must fit within the principle of the bill. Quite often that means that the principle is understood by the chair or the legal staff advising the chair as simply the principle of a given provision, and therefore, an attempt to work more broadly than the narrow purpose of a given provision is often ruled out of order.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855684">Beyond that, I have found so far in committees, since arriving in the House, that there seems be a reluctance at the moment, on the part of the advisers to chairs, to understand that bills can often have multiple purposes and not just a single purpose. Therefore, in the end, after second reading, committee work often really is an exercise in frustration, because a lot could be done to perfect a bill that is technically ruled out of order due to the fact that we have to work within the principle of the bill as voted at second reading. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855685">It is great that this bill is going to committee before second reading. It will hopefully allow, in the spirit of what this procedure is all about, a full, frank hearing, from all kinds of witnesses, about the problems I hope the government understands are in this bill. I hope this is also the reason the minister has decided to send it to committee before second reading. There can be true dialogue and engagement among MPs, obviously with the government watching what is going on and giving its input through government MPs, so that this bill is taken apart and rewritten in the way this procedure would allow.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855686">I myself stood in the House to move unanimous consent to have Bill <Document DbId="6398775" Type="3">C-23</Document>, what New Democrats called the unfair elections act and the government called the fair elections act, referred to committee before second reading, exactly for the reasons I have just given. There were so many obvious problems in the bill. Not sticking to the principle in the bill and working collegially across party lines would have benefited the study of that bill. In retrospect, New Democrats realize how true that was. Although we got serious amendments passed, with pressure from backbench members of the government suggesting changes that helped us in our efforts, that bill would be much better if it had gone to committee before second reading.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855687">There is another procedure that, in the spirit of openness, I am hoping the minister might consider. To date, it has not been the practice of the government to table opinions about the constitutionality or charter compliance of a bill. Given the real concerns that exist with respect to warrantless access to information that is contained in this bill as kind of a compendium bill to Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document>, I would ask the minister to please consider, for once, having the Department of Justice table a written opinion on the constitutionality of this. Why does it think that the Spencer judgment coming out of the Supreme Court of Canada does not apply or, if it applies, that the bill is written in a way that justifies it under the charter?</ParaText><ParaText id="3855688">So often in committee there is minimal to no good testimony from the civil service side on why, supposedly, the <Affiliation DbId="194629" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> has certified that a bill is in compliance with the charter. We know that the standard for the minister doing that is a very minimalist standard. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3855689">I will read from the Senate testimony on Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document> from Michael Geist, of the University of Ottawa, to tell the House why having that additional procedure as part of the referral to committee before second reading would be useful. He says:</ParaText><ParaText id="3855690"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Unpack the legalese and you find that organizations will be permitted to disclose personal information without consent (and without a court order) to any organization that is investigating a contractual breach or possible violation of any law. This applies both [to] past breaches or violations as well as potential future violations. Moreover, the disclosure occurs in secret without the knowledge of the affected person (who therefore cannot challenge the disclosure since they are not aware it is happening).</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3855691">That is an extremely good summary of a core problem with the bill in terms of the fears it raises that it has gone too far. It would purportedly create an updated regime to protect privacy and in the process would potentially ram through new problems with respect to Canadians' privacy.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855692">I would like to now, in my last couple of minutes, go over a few points that I hope come up in committee. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855693">I wish to thank a constituent, Mr. John Wunderlich, an expert in privacy law, who worked with me on the weekend to better understand the bill. These are points that I hope do have discussed.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855694">In paragraph 4(1)(b) of the act, the definition of who this would apply to would move from just employees to employees and applicants for employment. In that context, this leaves hanging the question of how much or how little this would apply to companies whose business is to conduct background checks. The committee should solicit feedback on this. In my view, the background check function in the employment sector is done far too often and too deeply and already constitutes a systemic privacy invasion in the employment sector. Therefore, this extension needs to be looked at. </ParaText><ParaText id="3855695">The next thing is the definition of valid consent. While it is welcome, because it brings clarity, the committee should note whether the current systems asserting consent on the web actually provide meaningful information to web surfers about just how many entities will be given access to either some or all of their personal information. Right now, there is a real risk that so-called valid consent, as outlined in the bill, would actually piggyback on the systematic sharing of information that people have no idea is being shared. The act could become a smokescreen behind which individual profiles were built and shared across businesses. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855696">I have already spoken about the potential for the warrantless invasion of privacy because of the fact that organizations could seek information from others when they are simply investigating breaches of agreement or fraud. We should keep in mind that when they are investigating fraud, it is not just in the criminal context. All of this involves civil questions as well. An example is fraudulent misrepresentation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855697">The “real risk of significant harm” test for companies in particular to decide whether they are going to inform the commissioner and at another stage inform persons of breaches of privacy is a problematic standard in the sense that it is actually very general, and it is probably too low. There should be a presumption for disclosure to the commissioner, and it should be left up to the commissioner to either determine, or assist the company in determining, whether this is significant enough to let the persons whose information was released know that it happened. At the moment, it is an entirely discretionary system, based on a very vague standard, which may mean that data will be breached without people actually knowing it and being able to take the measures necessary to protect themselves.</ParaText><ParaText id="3855698">Those are only three of the more specific concerns that need to be looked at. There is a lot in the bill.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3855699">I have a final comment, and it may be a rather strange one. I am looking at my colleague across the way. The privacy legislation from Alberta should be looked at very closely as a reference point for whether the government has gotten certain things wrong. That province has gotten things right. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

As noted by the Assistant Deputy Attorney General of Ontario, James Cornish, in his letter to the Committee, “[i]t appears, however, that this level of compliance with s. 530(3) has not been accomplished across the board in Ontario (…) [F]urther effort is still required (…)”</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3855996">This is 2014, and we are still trying to inform judges.

It is a question of choice, but often the judge sees the last name and assumes the person is francophone.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856001">I will explain why I chose to use the name “Doucet” in my example. One of my colleagues, the former union president at the Brunswick mine—once I left the position—had the last name Doucet, but he did not speak a word of French. Everyone spoke to him and wrote him letters in French, and he always responded by saying he did not speak French.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856002">If the judge relies on a name like Doucet, Boivin or even Godin—there are some French-speaking Godins and some English-speaking ones—to determine whether the person is francophone or anglophone, he could be mistaken. In the justice system, it is important that people be able to express themselves in their own language. We cannot stress that enough. My bill about Supreme Court justices indicated that it is unusual that the justices sitting on the highest court are not bilingual. That shows how the government is still stuck on this. It agreed to make the Federal Court and the court of appeal bilingual. However, the government feels that the Supreme Court, the highest court in the country, does not need to be bilingual. That really worries me.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856003">We have the report and the study. The study was positive. It worries me that even at the end of 2014, people are still asking questions about this and trying to convince judges to do what they are supposed to do in every province in the country and tell the accused that he has a right. It is the law. We are still trying to convince them. I do not think there should be any need to convince them. We should simply have to tell them that they represent justice and the law and that they have to follow the law or face the consequences.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856004">I would like to compare this to the rules of the road again. If people drive faster than the speed limit, there are consequences. Nobody tells the offender that they hope he will soon learn to drive at the speed limit. I have never seen a police officer stop someone and tell him that he can do it another 50 times so that he can learn to drive at the speed limit or that even though he was driving 300 kilometres per hour, he still has time to learn.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856005"> The time has come for the <Affiliation DbId="194629" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> to step up and send a clear message to all judges about this.</ParaText>

The act was passed in the 1990s, and we are still having problems on the ground today. I invite the minister to follow up with his department to make sure that when the next study is done, this will no longer be a problem. Our country's two official languages will have been accepted very respectfully and will be promoted. When both languages are promoted and respected, I can guarantee that the two populations will get along better than they do now. Furthermore, this has to come from above, from our leaders, our governments and the Supreme Court, for instance. This has to come from above and be practised on the ground. I guarantee that everyone will get along better at that point. As long as people know that bilingualism is not being embraced by those higher up, they will continue to fight one another down below.</ParaText>

Some other countries have four, five or six languages. Parents tell their children that being able to speak several languages is a gift. Here we are still telling our children not to speak English or not to speak French. Both sides are guilty. I am not taking sides here.

What is more, it wanted to close the only French-language marine rescue centre in Canada, which is located in Quebec City. It is thanks to the Commissioner of Official Languages and the work that he did that the government finally decided to allow that centre to remain open.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856032"> I am pessimistic because the Conservatives basically do not care. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> likes to start his speeches in French but that is not what is happening out in the community. There is no end to the cuts.

							<ParaText id="3856033">Leadership needs to start at the top, not the bottom.

The <Affiliation DbId="194629" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> mentioned to me earlier today that he recently met with the Commissioner of Official Languages and that he wishes to thank the commissioner for his very good work in this area and all areas concerning official languages.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856037">As members know, access to justice in both official languages is an important issue for all Canadians. Canadians wish to live in a law-abiding society with an equitable, accessible and fair justice system for all. In criminal matters, these principles mean that the courts must be able to operate in French and in English in accordance with the official language chosen by the accused for his or her trial. It is extremely important that one's constitutional rights are well understood, and this is a fundamental principle of justice.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856038"> First, it is important to remember that because of the division of legislative authority between the federal and provincial governments, the federal government has a limited role in the implementation of the Criminal Code provisions. While the federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over amendments made to the Criminal Code and over criminal procedure, the provinces are primarily responsible for the administration of the courts and the prosecutions under the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856039">While the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has executive authority for the appointment of superior and appeal courts judges, the provinces and territories are responsible for the composition of the provincial courts. This means that under the provisions of the Criminal Code, which form the basis for the standing committee's statutory review of part XVII, the provinces and territories must ensure that they have the institutional and human resources necessary within their respective criminal justice systems to allow defendants to face trial in the official language of their choice. That said, working within its jurisdiction and its means, the Government of Canada is supported by the minister and the Department of Justice, and works with its provincial and territorial counterparts in order to support and improve the implementation of the language provisions found in the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856040">Our government's commitment to official languages is undeniable. In Canada's economic action plan 2013, our government pledged to support official languages by maintaining funding dedicated to protecting, celebrating and reinforcing Canada's linguistic duality. This commitment is reflected in the road map for Canada's official languages 2013 to 2018. The road map, which was approved by this government in December 2013, has three pillars: education, immigration and communities. Under the road map, the Government of Canada has undertaken a number of measures to fulfill its commitment and to support our provincial and territorial partners. The access to justice in both official languages support fund, with a five-year funding envelope of $40 million, allocates resources to, among others, the provinces, territories, court administrations, universities, training centres and official language minority communities. This funding supports justice in both official languages within their respective spheres of activity. In addition to grants and contributions, the government also provides support to its governmental and non-governmental partners in the form of collaborative activities and ongoing consultations.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856041">All told, provinces and territories can count on this government to provide them with the necessary financial and collaborative support for language-training programs that are specifically adapted to the needs of justice stakeholders, including crown prosecutors, provincial court clerks, provincially appointed criminal judges, and probation officers.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856042">In addition, as part of its ongoing efforts and in response to the standing committee's recommendations stemming from the statutory review of part XVII of the Criminal Code, the Department of Justice has made a contribution toward the creation of a national consortium for justice training in both official languages. The consortium is essentially made up of post-secondary teaching institutions, jurilinguistic centres and non-profit organizations that provide training services. This consortium will advise the Department of Justice, where appropriate, on the language-training needs of provincial justice stakeholders. It will also develop collaborative approaches among its members in an effort to meet these training needs. It should be noted that the <Affiliation DbId="194629" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation>, as evidenced by the government's comprehensive response to the committee's report, has committed to bringing the committee's recommendation with respect to court interpreters and transcribers to the consortium's attention for consideration.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856043">In addition to its justice stakeholder training initiatives, this government is committed to ensuring that all Canadians from coast to coast to coast can rely on accurate, reliable and easy ways to find and access legal information in the official language of their choice. In this regard, the Department of Justice will call upon an extensive network of partners to develop a concept of justice information hubs. In order to prevent the unnecessary duplication of structures and to build bridges between organizations serving both official language communities, partnerships between minority community associations and organizations will be encouraged.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="40">(1540)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3856044">Once they are rolled out, these hubs would serve as a stepping stone for Canadians to become more knowledgeable about their legal rights and obligations, including their language rights under the Criminal Code and the Canadian charter, and to be better equipped to deal with everyday legal issues. </ParaText><ParaText id="3856045">In addition to the access to justice in both official languages support fund initiatives, the Government of Canada also fulfills its commitment through the Contraventions Act fund, which provides provinces and territories that have signed agreements with the Department of Justice to implement the federal contraventions regime with financial support to cover judicial and extrajudicial measures that guarantee language rights provided under part XVII of the Criminal Code and part IV of the Official Languages Act, regarding services and communications to the public. </ParaText><ParaText id="3856046">This fund, consisting of approximately $50 million over five years, demonstrates the government's strong commitment to supporting measures and providing the necessary resources, such as the hiring of bilingual judicial and extrajudicial court personnel, language training, bilingual signage and documentation, to enhance Canadians' access to justice in both official languages.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856047">Furthermore, the government's commitment to justice in both official languages is also reflected by the close co-operation between federal institutions, such as the Department of Justice, the Public Prosecution Service of Canada, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Department of Public Safety. As evidence of this close co-operation on the issue of access to justice in both official languages, these institutions have created an interdepartmental network on justice and security, specifically dedicated to the issues faced by Canada's francophone and anglophone minority communities. </ParaText><ParaText id="3856048">At the intergovernmental level, the Government of Canada has adopted a fair and reasonable approach to support access to justice in both official languages, based on collaboration with the provinces and territories. As the standing committee rightly recommends in its report, it is essential that the government continue in the same vein in order to ensure compliance with part XVII of the Criminal Code and to find solutions to the particular challenges associated with access to justice in both official languages. </ParaText><ParaText id="3856049">As part of its efforts in this regard, the Department of Justice co-chairs a federal-provincial-territorial working group on access to justice in both official languages. In addition, other intergovernmental forums, such as the federal-provincial-territorial heads of prosecution committee, are actively addressing issues relating to the implementation of part XVII of the Criminal Code as part of their respective mandates. </ParaText><ParaText id="3856050">As stated at the outset, and as evidenced by the concrete measures and steps I have just outlined, the government's commitment to official languages is abundantly clear.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856051"> On behalf of the government, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights for its work accomplished as part of the statutory review of part XVII of the Criminal Code. Rest assured, the Government of Canada is taking the committee's recommendations into consideration and is grateful for the possible solutions that the committee outlined so as to help ensure a better implementation of part XVII of the Criminal Code, and more generally, access to justice in both official languages for all Canadians.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Those committees meet regularly.

Contained in that section is a mandatory statutory review. The review was undertaken by the justice committee, which is the committee that is designated under that section of the code. The review took place over the course of five meetings. </ParaText><ParaText id="3856064">The goal or the purpose of having a statutory review such as this built into the Criminal Code, built into this particular section of the Criminal Code, is that at the time it was brought in there was a realization that circumstances change, that society evolves. In this case, we can look back on recent years and see the increasing diversity in Canada. We can look at the levels of language training in the various provinces, the various interpretations of the charter of rights over the years, and the development of technology and the impact it has had on the administration of justice. </ParaText><ParaText id="3856065">The drafters, at the time, inserted this into the code so that these things could be taken account of. It forces parliamentarians to address their attention to the language rights measures in the code, and every so often ask if they could be improved, if they were still effective and if there was something else that needed to be done. Quite frankly, it just makes good sense for something as fundamental as language rights to be assessed on a regular basis, in that way, for that reason.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856066">The other complicating factor here is the overlapping jurisdictions. The Government of Canada has jurisdiction over the Criminal Code, but the administration of justice is a provincial responsibility. Any time there are overlapping jurisdictions, there is always a risk that something is going to fall through the gaps. Indeed, we see that in this country in health care. The drafters of this provision within part XVII realized that when it comes to the language of the accused, when it comes to the fundamental rights, when it comes to the overlapping jurisdictions, this was something they wanted to be very certain had the vigilant eye of parliamentarians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856067">For that reason, it made good sense for this review to happen. The committee took its work very seriously, as I said. We heard from provincial ministers of justice, the Commissioner of Official Languages, and others. We heard from practitioners in the field. They came before the committee to offer their suggestions and advice. The conclusion, I am happy to report, is that these provisions of the code are generally being administered without any major difficulty, but there is some room for improvement. The room for improvement is reflected in the report, in the eight recommendations at the end.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856068">By way of background, this provision of the code was enacted in 1978 and was eventually adopted by all the provinces by 1990. Under part XVII of the Criminal Code, on application by an accused, a judge will order that the accused be tried before a judge or a judge and jury, as the case may be, who speak the official language of Canada that is the language of the accused. If the accused speaks neither English nor French, a judge will order that he or she be tried before a judge or a judge and jury who speak the official language of Canada in which the accused can best give testimony. Courts are also required to make interpreters available to assist the accused, counsel and witnesses.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856069">Some of the issues that were identified during the course of the committee's review included the right of notification of the accused to be tried in the official language of his choice. The fact is that this right is communicated to the accused in ways that are not consistent across the country.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3856070">In some jurisdictions that right is given to the accused verbally by the presiding judge. In other circumstances the judge simply notifies counsel for the accused and leaves the responsibility of advising the accused of that right with his counsel. In my experience in the criminal court I would suggest that either is equally effective. When counsel gives his undertaking to the court that he or she will take the advice of the judge and pass it on to the accused, that can be taken to the bank. That is a solemn undertaking given to the court. It would be a breach of professional ethics to violate that undertaking. In some courts there is a printed card that is given to the accused to notify him or her of this.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856071">Probably because of the overlapping jurisdictions and different practices within provinces, the varying degrees of presence of both official languages in different jurisdictions is uneven. That does not make it bad but it does underline the need for a regular review.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856072">We heard also about judicial language training. This is critical for language rights within the justice system to have any meaning. For the judges who are presiding over cases, whether appointed provincially or federally and whether at the provincial court or the Supreme Court level, and I would argue even at the Court of Appeal level, there has to be a capacity to be able to provide a fair hearing in the language of choice of the accused. </ParaText><ParaText id="3856073">In some jurisdictions, that is harder than it may seem. In my home province of Prince Edward Island I can say that there are three provincial court judges, five supreme court judges and three judges of the court of appeal. None of them would have their mother tongue as French, but more than half of them are actively pursuing French language training and one to the point where he has succeeded in getting what civil servants call a level C. That is Mr. Justice Gordon Campbell. There are others who are in it. This is something that is taken very seriously by the judges in this country, even in areas where a French trial would be a rarity.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856074">However, it goes beyond the training of judges. In order for this right to have teeth, it is not just the judges that need a capacity in both languages, there is also a need for court interpreters and for some capacity to be able to select a jury in both official languages. Indeed, that can be a challenge. These are the types of issues we heard about at committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856075">There are a couple of other issues that came up at committee that are also dealt with in the recommendations. When we talk about the right of an accused to a fair trial, I would suggest that it is not just about what happens in the court room after the accused pleads guilty. In the preliminary proceedings prior to a trail there is often a bail hearing. I would suggest that the right to be tried and have access to the judicial system in the language of one's choice would include the right to have a bail hearing conducted in French or English. In any criminal proceeding it would also include that the accused has the right to a complete package of disclosure from the Crown, which would include police notes and the like. These should be made available to an accused person in the language of his or her choice.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856076">All of these require resources and funding. Any time we have resources, funding and two levels of jurisdiction inevitably the finger pointing starts as to who is responsible. That is the very thing that needs to be avoided in the interest of justice.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="00">(1600)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3856077">At the conclusion of the testimony, at the conclusion of all the evidence we heard from the experts, from the provincial attorneys general, the justice committee came up with eight recommendations.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856078">I believe that the recommendations were well-reasoned. The parliamentary secretary was quite right. While we did have a good discussion at committee, this report was adopted on consensus, and I am pleased to stand by the report. I do believe that a proper and thorough examination was done, as was contemplated by those who mandated the statutory review within the Criminal Code with respect to language of the accused.

In some provinces, and Yukon springs to mind, sometimes it took a bit of time to find a francophone judge to take a trial in that province and to preside over preliminary hearings.

The situation across the country, as we might expect, is not uniform. We live in a country where there is one officially bilingual province, and that is the province of New Brunswick.

							<ParaText id="3856085"> Probably the most compelling testimony we heard at committee was from a defence lawyer who said that when he sees someone who is on remand down in the holding cell and he talks to that individual about his rights, his language rights, his charter rights and what to expect, the only thing that individual wants is out. It does not matter whether the individual can understand the proceedings on a scale of 10 to 10 or six to 10, if he can get a judge and a hearing quicker by electing one official language rather than the other, that is the one he wants.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856086">That is the reality in this country.

They see the merit of the government introducing legislation on how Canadians can be protected. However, there is also a great deal of concern about the manner in which the Conservative government, as it has in the past, appears to be attempting to overstep concerns related to privacy and protecting the privacy of Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856118">We have before us Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document> this afternoon. It attempts to deal with and expand warrantless access to subscribers' data. This is an issue which can no doubt be exceptionally controversial. It is something that needs to have more consultation and work with the different stakeholders so that we do not make mistakes.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856119">As suggested in the bill's title, this bill has come from the Senate. There were concerns upon its departure from the Senate and entry into the House regarding the constitutionality of the legislation. I have found that quite often the government will bring legislation into the House in anticipation that it will ultimately pass, yet a great deal of concern has been expressed regarding the degree to which it would be in compliance with Canada's Constitution, the Charter of Rights, and so forth.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856120">Time and time again, I have heard it suggested, and I have suggested it myself, that the government needs to be more forthright in providing information which clearly shows that the legislation it is bringing forward would pass our laws. More often than not, we do not receive the legal opinions from the department giving clear indication that the legislation being debated is in fact constitutional and will pass the Supreme Court. That is important to note, for the simple reason that when the House of Commons passes legislation and it gets challenged, it costs literally millions of dollars, especially if the government has done it wrong.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856121">The idea of seeing Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document> go to the committee is something we are quite comfortable with. Going through the summary of the bill gives us the sense of the scope we are dealing with. The act would amend the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act to do a litany of things. It covers quite a broad area. We have expressed a great deal of concern about some of it to the Liberal Party critic.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856122">The primary concern we have is ensuring that the privacy of Canadians is being respected. Checks need to be put into place to ensure that there is accountability.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856123">Let me give members a couple of very specific examples of what the legislation is proposing. This comes from the summary of the bill itself. It would “permit the disclosure of personal information without the knowledge or consent of an individual for the purposes of...” </ParaText><ParaText id="3856124">Here it lists some very specific things. These are:</ParaText><ParaText id="3856125"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="3" IndentRest="3">(i) identifying an injured, ill or deceased individual and communicating with their next of kin, </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3856126"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="3" IndentRest="3">(ii) preventing, detecting or suppressing fraud, or </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3856127"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="3" IndentRest="3">(iii) protecting victims of financial abuse;</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3856128">As I said, there are a litany of things. One that really caught my eye and that I think is a very strong positive is related to the Privacy Commissioner. The bill says, “modify the information that the Privacy Commissioner may make it public if he or she considers that it is in the public interest to do so”.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856129">We have seen an expansion of the role, if I can put it that way, of the Privacy Commissioner, and giving more authority to him or her. Through the legislation, we are also seeing more penalties being brought in.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3856130">This is not only the first but the second piece of legislation over the last number of months dealing with privacy. It was not that long ago that I was speaking to Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document>, the protecting Canadians from online crime act. It deals with cyberbullying. Canadians have little tolerance for cyberbullying and the types of things that take place. </ParaText><ParaText id="3856131">Bill <Document DbId="6301394" Type="3">C-13</Document> focuses a great deal of attention on the distribution of pictures without consent onto the Internet. We had some difficulty with Bill C-13, as we do with Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document>, but we ultimately ended up supporting the legislation because we recognized how important it was to stop cyberbullying. There were concerns with that legislation just like there are concerns with this particular piece of legislation. </ParaText><ParaText id="3856132">We would like the government to provide more answers and be a bit more transparent about what it hopes to achieve with this legislation. We call upon the government to do just that in anticipation of the bill going to committee where it will be changed in order to provide some comfort to Canadians with respect to their privacy. Privacy is an issue that the Liberal Party takes seriously. Our party critic has had the opportunity to express many of our concerns with regard to it.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856133">Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document> would allow for warrantless requests of companies. Telecom companies and service providers could be approached in order to access personal information. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856134">Over the last decade we have seen an explosion of technology in the computer and Internet areas. Who would have thought 15 or 20 years ago that we would be where we are today? In many ways we are playing catch-up in terms of trying to bring forward legislation in order to protect Canadians. Canadians have great access to the Internet as a whole. Many things are done through the Internet and unfortunately, at times, people are exploited, so we need bills such as Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document> to deal with that. </ParaText><ParaText id="3856135">Today we are talking about corporations getting personal information about people living in Canada who ultimately go to a particular telecom provider. That means company <I>x</I> could request specific information from a telecom provider about a particular customer who is being serviced by that provider. All of us should be concerned about that. All of us should want to do what we can to ensure that the privacy of Canadians is respected and that there are checks in place to ensure no abuse is taking place. </ParaText><ParaText id="3856136">What we are talking about are warrantless requests. People would be surprised to know that in 2011, almost 800,000 warrantless requests by telecom companies were documented. People would be amazed to know the amount of information that leaves Canada through the Internet via, for example, the United States and ultimately comes back into Canada. The U.S. national security agency no doubt has access to a lot of Canadians' personal information.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="20">(1620)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3856137">At the end of the day, the bottom line is that the government has a responsibility to provide assurances to Canadians that their right to privacy is being protected. This is the greatest concern I have as the bill continues to go forward. </ParaText><ParaText id="3856138">The challenge is to ask the government to provide the necessary amendments that would protect and provide assurances to Canadians that their privacy would in fact be protected. I am very concerned that private corporations, on a whim, could say a copyright has been infringed, or there is a perceived illegal activity and then are able to get personal information on Canadians. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I am also pleased to be able to tell Canadians young and old, as well as businesses, exactly what this bill would do for them.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856155"> Bill S-4 would provide important updates to our private sector privacy law, called the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, commonly known as PIPEDA. This bill is all about keeping our laws up to date in the rapidly burgeoning digital economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856156">The biggest thrust in the protection of Canadians' online privacy, which we eagerly and sometimes maybe too eagerly jump to use, as this is a place where we go to surf, shop, and sell things, is to improve the protection of people's privacy. Our government understands that for a strong digital economy to work and for people to feel confident using this technology, they have to know that they are receiving those protections.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856157">We have consulted very widely with business, with consumer advocates, and with a lot of real people, like moms and dads, to come up with this bill. Our consultations have shown one thing that is very clear, which is that people value their privacy. It is very important to Canadians. As a country, we regard it as a fundamental right, and we expect our personal information to have certain protections. All of us want to be able to embrace this great opportunity that is the web, and we want to have trust and confidence that our information will be protected when we are out there swiping our credit cards, punching in our PIN and pass codes, and giving out our names and addresses at stores and other places where we do businesses. Really, we are putting the details of our personal lives out there in the hands of businesses and other organizations.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856158">Earlier this year, our government launched Digital Canada 150. This was an ambitious plan to give Canadians confidence that they can take advantage of the full opportunities of the digital age. One of the main pillars of Digital Canada 150 is protecting Canadians, and that is where Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document>, which we are talking about today, comes in. It would take what is already one of the world's best privacy regimes and make it even better.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856159">The digital privacy act has five key areas, and I would like to touch on each one and explain for my hon. colleagues why each one is necessary.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856160">The first area is mandatory notification if there are data breaches. These are requirements for companies to let us know if our personal information has been lost and there is a potential to expose us to harm. The time frame companies would be given to do this under this bill would be as soon as was feasible. For example, if a company's computer system was hacked and the clients' credit card information was stolen, the company might need a week to put a fence around it and figure out how many people had been affected and let us, as consumers, know. If the data breach or the hacker was more sophisticated, it might take the company a couple of weeks to figure out everyone who was affected and let us know. There would be some flexibility, but one thing that would be very clear would be that companies could not delay notifying us when there was this kind of breach.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856161"> If a company was hacked and it failed to notify clients in the shortest time frame possible, it could be taken to court by the Privacy Commissioner or by individuals. In addition, if a company willfully covered up a data or privacy breach, it could be charged up to $100,000 for every client that had not been notified. We see that these are very significant penalties. Recent revelations that large everyday retailers we deal with, such as Target and Home Depot, were victims of cyberattacks underscores the need for this legislation. </ParaText><ParaText id="3856162">Also, the Privacy Commissioner would have to be notified, so if an organization deliberately covered up a privacy breach or intentionally failed to notify individuals or the Privacy Commissioner, again it could face significant fines.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856163">The second set of changes in Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document> deals with the rules around vulnerable individuals, especially kids. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3856164">The government examined this issue very closely as well and talked with experts and other interested parties. Based on this, it put new measures in the digital privacy act that would make it very clear that to give valid consent for information to be collected online, a person's age would have to be taken into account. For example, if one had a website specifically targeted at children and wanted to collect information, one would need to put in something like a pop-up that would say, “before filling in this information, go get your mom and dad”. Children's interests would now be put forward, and that would have to be done using very simple language.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856165">These measures would put more power in the hands of consumers and would keep them better informed when they were out there doing business involving the worldwide web. They would also encourage businesses to adopt better privacy practices.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856166">At the same time as we would be adding new privacy protections, we would also be removing some red tape. The third set of changes would ensure that businesses could collect data they needed to do legitimate business things. I want to stress that these changes would be limited and very much common sense. For instance, believe it or not, right now businesses are breaking the law if they give their own employees' email addresses to customers and clients without the employees' permission. Things like that just do not make sense. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856167">These amendments would let businesses use personal information produced at work; disclose information, such as employees' salaries, that might be important if one were buying or selling a business; use information that might be contained in a witness statement to process an insurance claim; and keep information that is necessary in a regular employee-employer relationship. Businesses would be able to use this information to support normal day-to-day business activities, but, and there is a big but, they would still have to make sure that the privacy of that information was protected and not compromised. If they did not play by the rules, companies could be named and shamed and taken to court and fined. </ParaText><ParaText id="3856168">The fourth group of amendments would allow certain information to be shared without necessarily first allowing for a person's consent if it was shown to be in the public interest or in that person's interest to do so. It would harmonize federal law with Quebec law, Alberta law, and British Columbia's private sector data protection acts.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856169">One might ask what kind of instance that would be. For example, it would protect seniors from financial abuse if a bank noticed that there was some untoward activity going on in their accounts. It would allow emergency, police, or medical officials to communicate with a person's family if the person were injured or deceased. </ParaText><ParaText id="3856170">Who would enforce all of this?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856171">PIPEDA is enforced by the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, who acts like an ombudsman and who would get stronger tools in this legislation. The Privacy Commissioner could turn a matter over to the Federal Court if an organization were breaking the rules, and the court could levy fines and order the company to clean up its act. As well, citizens could personally take companies to Federal Court to order them to change their practices or could ask the court to award personal damages.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856172"> The bill would also boost the time available for a complaint if one was going to take an organization to court. It used to be 45 days, but under this proposed legislation, it would grow to a year. </ParaText><ParaText id="3856173">Finally, the digital privacy act would create a new tool that would be an alternative to court action. The Privacy Commissioner could negotiate a binding deal with a company to make significant changes to comply with the legislation in exchange for not being taken to court.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856174">This is all about confidence. It is about the consumer having confidence when having their personal information used so that they can do trade and commerce. They can surf the web.

Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document> amends the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act to compel private sector organizations to disclose any loss or breach of personal information. So far, so good. It also sets out sanctions to be imposed on organizations that fail to comply with that obligation. Again, so far, so good.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856195">However, the proposed criterion for mandatory reporting is subjective, because it allows organizations to determine themselves whether it is:</ParaText><ParaText id="3856196"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...reasonable in the circumstances to believe that the breach creates a real risk of significant harm to an individual.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856197">In my opinion, this major flaw in the bill needs to be corrected. Why make laws if we are going to ask the organizations to enforce them themselves? I have my doubts. That is like giving a minister full power. That does not work either.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856198"> Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document> would also give the Privacy Commissioner new powers to enter into compliance agreements with organizations that, according to the Commissioner, have failed to respect the provisions in the legislation, leaving the personal information of Canadians vulnerable. So far, so good.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856199">Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document> adds exceptions under which personal information may be collected, used or disclosed without an individual’s consent. The bill would make it easier for organizations to share personal information with each other without the consent of individuals, if the organizations are engaged in a process leading to a prospective business transaction.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856200">The NDP absolutely disagrees with this type of provision. It is really not good for consumers. People will receive more advertising and unsolicited communications. We do not really need that in our consumerist society.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856201">In other words, the bill allows an organization to disclose private client information under certain circumstances. If a company has my private information, for example, it can share it with another company, which can then do whatever it wants with that information. The next thing I know, I am receiving ads, or other unwanted things, at home. I do not think that is right. That is a very significant flaw in the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856202">Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document> also amends provisions in the law that define the situations in which a person whose private information has been lost or compromised by a security breach can apply to the Federal Court for a hearing after receiving the Commissioner’s report or having been informed of the end of the complaint investigation. The bill extends the timeframe from 45 days to one year for a complainant to make an application to the court. I have to admit, that is a useful provision because it gives people more time to figure things out. It gives them a chance to analyze the situation and make a decision about whether to go or not go to court.</ParaText>

I am not convinced of the merits of this provision.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856204">My party and I are extremely concerned about the fact that Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document> contains a provision that allows organizations to more easily share personal information without a warrant, without the consent of the clients and without an appropriate oversight mechanism. That is very worrisome and should be amended right away. </ParaText><ParaText id="3856205"> Given a recent Supreme Court of Canada decision, this provision will very likely be deemed unconstitutional. It is therefore important that the government comply with the Supreme Court's decision and remove from the bill all clauses relating to the warrantless disclosure of personal information.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856206">The government has a very poor track record when it comes to protecting personal information. Although Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document> contains some good provisions, it will not erase the past. The bill must therefore be amended so that it really meets the needs of Canadians and complies with international privacy standards.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856207"> In just one year, under this <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s government, government organizations secretly made over 1.2 million requests to telecommunications companies for personal information without a warrant and without proper oversight.

We have fallen far behind in terms of international standards.

							<ParaText id="3856231">Data breaches continue to be a major challenge to the privacy and security of citizens around the world. For example, this past summer JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., one of the largest banks in the U.S., was the victim of an attack that affected the accounts of 76 million households and seven million small businesses. Home Depot recently confirmed that 56 million payment cards were impacted in a breach of its payment card systems that lasted for five months.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856232">Worldwide, there were between 575 million and 822 million data breaches in 2013. In the U.S. alone, nearly 92 million records were compromised in 2013.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856233">Currently PIPEDA contains no obligations for businesses or organizations to tell customers when their personal information has been lost or stolen. I am pleased to tell the House that Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document> introduces measures to address this issue. The bill creates new requirements under PIPEDA for reporting losses, theft, or other unauthorized access to personal information that may result from accidental or malicious activity.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856234">These provisions would ensure that Canadians can take action to protect their personal information in the event of a privacy breach, while also encouraging businesses to adopt better information security practices. Organizations that deliberately ignored these requirements would face penalties of up to $100,000 per offence.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856235">Let me explain how the new provisions will work. </ParaText><ParaText id="3856236">Under Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document>, an organization that suffers a privacy breach would be required to notify affected individuals if there is a risk of significant harm. The organization would also have to report the breach to the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856237"> In fact, the interim Privacy Commissioner, Chantal Bernier, said that this bill contains “...very positive developments for the privacy rights of Canadians”. She was pleased that the government had addressed issues such as breach notifications.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856238">The bill identifies the factors an organization would have to consider when determining whether or not there was a real risk that some form of significant harm would occur as a result of a privacy breach.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856239">First, the organization would have to consider the sensitivity of the personal information. Second, the organization would have to consider the probability that the stolen information would be misused—for example, whether the data was encrypted, how much time had passed between the occurrence of the breach and its detection, and whether the cause of the breach was a malicious attack or was accidental.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856240">Let me say again that by law, an organization would be required to notify individuals as soon as a breach was confirmed. If an organization determined there had been a breach, it would also have to notify other organizations in order to reduce the potential risk for the individual whose information was compromised. For example, if a store experienced a breach of its customer records, it would have to notify the relevant credit card companies or financial institutions.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3856241">Let me draw the attention of the House to a key element of these data breach requirements, which is that the bill would require organizations to keep records of all data breaches and provide this information to the Privacy Commissioner upon request. This would give the commissioner the ability to oversee data breach reporting and notification requirements. The Privacy Commissioner would be able to request these data breach records at any time. There would be no need for him to be conducting an audit or investigation when he requests them. </ParaText><ParaText id="3856242">Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document> includes heavy fines for companies that knowingly contravene these new requirements. Companies that deliberately failed to report a data breach to the commissioner or failed to notify individuals would face fines of up to $800,000. This could be up to $100,000 for every individual not told. Similarly, companies that deliberately cover up a data breach by not keeping these records or by destroying them could also face fines of up to $100,000.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856243">Some might ask why there is a need for penalties related to data breach notification, given that most organizations comply with the Privacy Commissioner's guidelines for voluntary notification already. The government recognizes that many organizations already notify individuals of data breaches in a responsible manner; however, some do not. These penalties would target the bad apples, those organizations that willfully and knowingly disregard their obligations or, worse, cover up a breach.</ParaText>

I will talk a little more about that, but first I want to take a moment to talk about the motion itself, which aims to send the bill to committee before second reading. This is somewhat strange; this is the first time the current government has done this in recent memory.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856258">It is rather interesting and makes me wonder. Why this measure right now? Why did the government decide to do this, when there were other bills? Is it because the government has its doubts about Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document> and wants to send it to committee, we hope, to solve the problems in the bill? That is what I am wondering.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856259">Although we requested that some highly contested bills be sent to committee before second reading, such as Bill <Document DbId="6398775" Type="3">C-23</Document> on election reform, Bill <Document DbId="6524997" Type="3">C-33</Document> on first nations education and Bill <Document DbId="6254809" Type="3">C-3</Document> on transporting oil along our coasts, the government refused. I have to wonder why it refused to do so and why it is now making the rather unusual—or at least uncommon, in recent history—move to send Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document>, a bill that comes not from the government, but from the Senate, to committee before second reading.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856260">Procedure is not one of my strong suits, but there are experts here who can clear this up for us. I find it rather interesting that when we send a bill to committee before second reading, as this motion would do, the scope of the proposed amendments can be much broader. In other words, we could make more extensive amendments since the study in committee is not restricted by the principle of the bill, which has not yet been approved by the House. That is interesting. We can hope that Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document> will be amended and that we will end up with a more polished product, if I can call it that, so that it will be more acceptable as we go into second reading.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856261">Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document> makes a pretty significant change to the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act. I took a look at this act, which received royal assent in April 2000. As members know, 14 years is an eternity in the digital world. A lot of things have happened in the past 14 years. This act was the result of an extensive consultation with a wide range of experts at all levels.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3856262">This work was accomplished through broad consultation in 2000. It is clear that since 2006, with this government, consultations are restricted to very specific groups. It is interesting to see that in 2000, there was a broad consultation that culminated with the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act. Here is what that legislation does:</ParaText><ParaText id="3856263"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> An Act to support and promote electronic commerce by protecting personal information that is collected, used or disclosed in certain circumstances, by providing for the use of electronic means to communicate or record information or transactions and by amending the Canada Evidence Act, the Statutory Instruments Act and the Statute Revision Act.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3856264">That is the legislation that is being amended now. Another interesting part of this law is schedule 1. Certain principles were set out in the legislation about to be amended, and they are particularly interesting because they were set out in the National Standard of Canada entitled Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information. The 10 principles are as follows: accountability; identifying purposes; consent; limiting collection; limiting use, disclosure, and retention; accuracy; safeguards; openness; individual access; and challenging compliance.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856265">I went to the trouble of reading those principles. I found them very interesting and I urge all members to read them. Like it or not, as members, we receive personal and confidential information in our riding offices. That is why we too have a responsibility to respect these principles of personal information and electronic document protection.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856266"> Right now, we are talking about a motion to refer Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document> to committee before second reading. I mentioned that this has not happened often in recent parliamentary history. In the time I have left, I would like to take a quick look at what Bill S-4 will change.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856267">This bill will make major changes to to the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, which I just mentioned, by allowing personal information to be shared without the knowledge of the person concerned or without their consent under some circumstances. To me, that is a questionable way of protecting personal information. Companies would be allowed to share personal information under certain conditions.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856268">As I read the bill, I really thought that there needed to be a better explanation of these conditions and some examples. For example, in a business transaction, when should personal information be shared without clients' consent?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856269">Some aspects of the bill are positive, such as requiring organizations to take various measures when a data breach occurs. Even the current government has some transparency problems in this regard. The third aspect seeks to create offences in relation to the contravention of certain obligations respecting breaches of security safeguards. The fourth aspect would allow the the Privacy Commissioner, in certain circumstances, to enter into a compliance agreement with an organization.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3856270">Those are the four main aspects of Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document> that raise concerns. Other aspects of the bill are positive and constitute a step in the right direction. That is why I support the motion to send Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document> to committee to resolve the problems it contains that could result in a breach of privacy.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The first is a comment that the opposition welcomes the fact that we might actually get a chance to discuss a bill and propose amendments when in fact this very government has refused request after request from this side of the House to do that kind of procedure so that substantial amendments can be made. For that very reason, we are procedurally supporting this.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856272">My second comment and question for the member is this. Again, the unelected Senate has come forward with suggested changes, improvements, and amendments to a bill. However, if there had been proper review and discourse with all sides of the House, it could have been improved to begin with. My concern in quickly looking at the bill, and far be it for me to profess that I know this area in detail, is that a good number of the security breaches are happening because of the government doing that, and yet this bill seems to refer to private organizations.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

At the same time, the courts would continue to enforce the law and could impose significant new penalties which have been added to encourage compliance with key requirements. </ParaText><ParaText id="3856295">Through PIPEDA, the Privacy Commissioner has the responsibility for overseeing compliance with the act. He has the power to investigate, enter premises and compel evidence. He can mediate a settlement, make recommendations and publish the names of those who contravene PIPEDA. In short, the commissioner investigates complaints and works with companies to ensure they comply with the act, but enforcement action is left to the Federal Court. Indeed, the Privacy Commissioner and the Federal Court have worked together effectively to administer and enforce the rules set out in the act.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856296">The commissioner or any other individuals can apply to the Federal Court for a hearing on any matter related to the original complaint. It is the court, not the commissioner, that has the authority to order the organization to change its practices. The Federal Court could also award damages to individuals when their privacy has been violated and they have suffered some form of harm as a result. Under the bill before us, both the courts and the Privacy Commissioner would be given new tools, but the responsibility for enforcement action would still remain with the court.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856297">As has been mentioned, new offences and penalties would be created for three areas relating to the new data breach rules contained in this legislation. The courts can assess penalties for: deliberately failing to report a data breach to the commissioner, as prescribed by the act; deliberately failing to notify an individual of a data breach, as prescribed by the act; and deliberately failing to maintain or deliberately destroying data breach records, as prescribed by the act.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856298">In keeping with existing offences under PIPEDA, these offences would be subject to a fine of up to $10,000 on summary conviction and up to $100,000 on indictment. I would point out to the House that the organization can be assessed a penalty for each and every individual it fails to notify. Given the large number of individuals who could potentially be affected by a data breach, this is a very serious penalty indeed.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856299">At the same time, the bill would give the Privacy Commissioner the tools he or she needs to monitor the impact and efficacy of these new rules and serve as an ombudsman to help reduce the number of cases that go before the courts. The Privacy Commissioner would be given the authority to negotiate compliance agreements with organizations. </ParaText><ParaText id="3856300">Let me give the House an example. Let us assume that following an investigation or audit, the commissioner determines that an organization should take certain corrective actions to remain compliant with the law. Under Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document>, the organization could agree to take these actions in exchange for the assurance that it would not be taken to court over the previous breach of the rules. However, the organization would also be legally accountable for any commitments made under the corrective action. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856301">Compliance agreements are an effective mechanism for holding organizations accountable. They allow the Privacy Commissioner and organizations to avoid costly court action and provide flexibility to suit the particular circumstances that an organization finds itself in.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856302">I would remind the House that compliance agreements are already being used by the Commissioner of the CRTC under the anti-spam legislation and the <Affiliation DbId="194628" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> under the Consumer Product Safety Act.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3856303">By adding compliance agreements to the tool box of the Privacy Commissioner, we would strengthen consumer privacy protection without fundamentally changing the framework of PIPEDA or the role of the commissioner. </ParaText><ParaText id="3856304">However, in order for this provision to work effectively, further changes to the regime are required. For example, under PIPEDA as it now stands, the commissioner has only 45 days after he or she reports the results of an investigation to make an application to the Federal Court to seek an order to take corrective action. Experience has shown that this is not enough time for the commissioner to work with companies to implement his recommendations and there is the risk that companies would simply stall in implementing the required changes until the 45-day period runs out.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856305">On top of these challenges, 45 days is likely not enough time to negotiate and implement a compliance agreement. That is why the bill would increase the period of time to make an application to the court to one year from the time the commissioner reports the results of his or her investigation. </ParaText><ParaText id="3856306">Finally, I would point out that the bill would give yet another tool to encourage compliance with the data breach provisions. It would give the commissioner the power to publicly disclose wrongdoing of an organization, if he or she considers it to be in the public interest to do so. Under the current act, the commissioner has limited provisions that involve the right to make public information concerning the personal information handling practices of the organization. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856307">However, currently, he or she cannot publicly report when, for example, organizations fail to co-operate with an investigation or repeatedly stall implementation of the recommendations to fix privacy problems. Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document> would broaden the types of information the commissioner could make public concerning non-compliant organizations. This is an important tool in encouraging compliance with the act. </ParaText><ParaText id="3856308">As technology and the marketplace evolve, the commissioner and the courts need more effective tools to help hold organizations accountable for their handling of personal information, for the protection of Canadians and their privacy.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856309">The bill before us addresses this need with four new tools. First, it would assign significant penalties for wilful disregard of the important new data breach notification requirements. Second, it would give the commissioner the authority to negotiate compliance agreements. Third, it would extend the length of time the commissioner or individuals have to bring matters before the court to one year. Fourth, it would give the commissioner greater authority to share more types of information about non-compliant organizations with the public. </ParaText><ParaText id="3856310">I hope honourable members will join me in supporting these new tools for the courts and Privacy Commissioner by supporting Bill <Document DbId="6524311" Type="3">S-4</Document>. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Trottier" id="8474127"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="194847" Type="18">Mr. Bernard Trottier (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Works and Government Services, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3856363">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today on this important piece of legislation for businesses and all Canadians. I would like to start with a bit of context to help us better understand the thinking that led to the introduction of this bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856364">Briefly, this bill is a direct result of the feedback we received from small businesses that are so vital to the long-term success of our country. We are debating it today because back in budget 2010, we made a commitment to review federal regulations in areas where reform is most needed to reduce the compliance burden on businesses, especially small businesses, while safeguarding the health and safety of Canadians.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856365">At the time the Canadian Federation of Independent Business estimated that businesses in Canada spend over $30 billion each year complying with regulations, so the government took action. In 2011, we created a Red Tape Reduction Commission, which was made up of both parliamentarians and private sector representatives. Its mandate was twofold. First, it was to identify irritants to businesses that stem from federal regulatory requirements that have a detrimental effect on growth, competitiveness, and innovation. Second, it was to recommend options that address these irritants and control and reduce the regulatory burden over the long term while ensuring that the environment and the health and safety of Canadians were not compromised in the process.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856366">The commission held consultations across Canada to hear directly from the people who are most affected by red tape. This included in particular small business owners. There was also an online consultation to allow an even wider range of business people to provide their views. Overall, people expressed concern with the unchecked growth of regulation and the costs they impose on businesses, especially small businesses. Specifically, business owners also told the commission that a one-for-one rule was necessary to control how often the government turns to regulation to address issues within industry. Then, in January 2012, the commission released its report, complete with recommendations for reducing red tape and its effects on the business community.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856367">It did not take long for the government to take action. A few months later, on April 1, 2012, the government put the one-for-one rule in place. This rule requires regulators to remove a regulation each time they introduce a new regulation that imposes an administrative burden on business. It has worked so well that we moved to enshrine this rule into law last January by introducing the red tape reduction act, which we are considering today.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856368">There is no better time than the present to give the one-for-one rule the force of law. Canada has weathered the economic downturn relatively well and is well positioned for sustained economic growth. We have gone from having one of the highest marginal effective tax rates on business to having one of the lowest. In fact, we are one of the few countries in the world that can boast of having both low debt and declining taxes. As a result, Canada is internationally recognized as one of the best places in the world to do business.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856369">In December 2012, Canada cracked the global top 10 with respect to corporate tax competitiveness, according to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers. This past January, in Bloomberg's rankings of the best countries in the world for doing business in 2014, Canada placed second, just behind Hong Kong and ahead of the United States. All of this points to an economy that continues to perform well in the global economic environment.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856370">However, now is not the time to rest on our laurels. If we are to continue to rank among the world's most successful nations, we have to keep that international confidence in Canada up. We are taking the right steps to do that. We are on track to balancing the budget, and we have continued to take measures to create a business climate that supports growth and job creation. At the same time, federal transfers to individuals, such as old age security and employment insurance, as well as major transfers to other levels of government, including those for social programs and health care, will continue to grow. We have also taken steps to improve the fairness and integrity of the tax system to ensure that everyone pays his or her fair share.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856371">We are also finding savings and efficiencies in the government's operations. At the same time, we are working to create an environment that is supportive of business. From 2008-09 through 2013-14, we delivered tax reductions totalling more than $60 billion to job-creating businesses. Among those measures is the reduction of the federal general corporate income tax rate to 15% in 2012, from more than 22% in 2007.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3856372">We have already taken steps to significantly improve Canada's tax competitiveness and business environment. Now, the steps that we are taking to reform the federal regulatory system are in line with these actions.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856373">Canada needs a regulatory system that works, one that is not overly burdensome, one that does not hinder the ability of businesses to innovate and grow, and one that protects Canadians' health and welfare. The bill being considered today is part of a package of regulatory reforms designed to modernize our regulatory system. By giving the one-for-one rule the added muscle of legislation, Canada would have one of the most aggressive red tape reduction measures in the world. It would increase Canadian competitiveness; free businesses to innovate, grow and create jobs; and underscore Canada's reputation as one of the best places in the world in which to invest and do business.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856374">Let me close by saying that the <Document DbId="6390464" Type="3">red tape reduction act</Document> is about bringing new discipline to how regulation works. It is about creating a more predictable environment for businesses, and it is about freeing Canadians and their companies to succeed.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856375">Small businesses are the foundation of this country's economy.

I have a very hard time trusting the Conservative government on this issue, even though we may agree on a few fundamental points.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856378">Bill <Document DbId="6390464" Type="3">C-21</Document> was introduced by the <Affiliation DbId="170841" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation> and has two key provisions. To begin, it will implement the one-for-one rule, in order to supposedly reduce the red tape that is hampering business growth and innovation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856379">This raises questions in my mind. It seems to me that a simple mathematical equation demonstrates that if we take one regulation away for every one we create—or one minus one—we get zero. We are back at square one, and nothing has improved. We have simply kept the situation from getting any worse. The rule is also based on the assumption that the two regulations are equal. A company will invest a different amount of time or financial resources, depending on the regulation. That is the first problem.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856380">Second, this bill would make the President of the Treasury Board the ultimate arbiter when it comes to eliminating regulations; it would give him a monopoly on that. That is the second problem and also very typical of this government's bills, which seek to concentrate power in the hands of ministers. This is another great example of that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856381">This bill certainly has to be analyzed in committee because, even though we agree on some of its general principles, it needs amendments to correct its shortcomings, particularly with respect to the environment.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856382">We also have to make sure that regulations protecting the health and safety of Quebeckers and Canadians are not gutted. We have to ensure that the health and safety of Canadians remain priorities in the debate on businesses' administrative burden.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856383">Small and medium-sized businesses are crucial to our economy. There is no doubt that they are essential to the job creation process, especially in Quebec, but also across the country. In ridings like mine, we want to see small businesses become medium-sized businesses. They are the backbone of our economy.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856384">Since we know how important small and medium-sized businesses are to economic recovery, we are of course ready to explore various options available to maximize their potential. Businesses could then focus on their two main objectives: growing their resources and creating jobs.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856385">Now that we have laid out the general principles, let us take a closer look at the implications of this bill. Let us talk about the first original sin: from the bill's preamble to its provisions, the notion of environmental safety is simply absent from the spirit and the letter of the bill. The unbelievable way this bill was conceived sacrifices all environmental issues. If there is one subject on which all Canadians agree, it is the environment, and yet it is completely absent from the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856386">The Conservative approach is to allow industrial stakeholders to self-regulate. That formula has been used in the past and has led to catastrophes. Here once again, industrial stakeholders regulate their own activities without any public power looking at the risks those activities pose to the environment</ParaText><ParaText id="3856387">Furthermore, health and safety are mentioned only in the bill's preamble, which leaves very little room in real terms for the importance that really should be placed on issues of health and safety. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856388">Since my colleagues opposite went to the trouble of including the one-for-one rule, the question is this: why did they not allocate the resources needed to make sure there is legislation in place to also protect the health and safety of Canadians?</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3856389">By all accounts, this bill embodies the Conservatives' thinking on the environment. They seem to think that environmental safety is an administrative burden that must be reduced, when environmental issues are directly related to the safety of citizens.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856390">Our legitimate questions on the scope of this bill on health and safety will lead the NDP to propose robust amendments to ensure the long-term sustainability of regulations protecting the health, safety and environment of Canadians. The rules that are in the public's interest must be upheld. This is not a question of exerting theoretical control over the number of rules, but of determining which ones are truly useful for the public.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856391">We must focus on tangible measures to help small business owners expand and beware of the illusions Bill <Document DbId="6390464" Type="3">C-21</Document> might create. The critical question posed by this bill could be summed up in these terms: it is not enough to reduce red tape for SMEs in an effort to support their potential for growth and innovation. These claims have to translate into action and these reduction measures must be consistent with health and environmental safety criteria.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856392">When it came to moving from words to action, the Conservatives refused to support the NDP motion on the regulation of credit card fees that card issuers charge merchants, for example. However, the lack of an ombudsman and non-existent regulation in this area are having a serious negative impact on the competitiveness of small businesses and constitute an extra administrative burden for these merchants. </ParaText><ParaText id="3856393">With regard to safety standards, we need look no further than the Lac-Mégantic tragedy, which is still fresh in everyone's minds. This tragedy reminds us of the extreme consequences that drastic deregulation can have and the risk that such an approach poses to rail safety.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856394">Furthermore, the Liberals, who are also very timid when it comes to regulation, reinforced the principle of deregulation of rail safety by continuing to implement an approach allowing the industry to monitor the safety of its own operations instead of requiring the government to set standards that the industry has to meet.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856395">That being said, the main focus of Bill <Document DbId="6390464" Type="3">C-21</Document> is to implement a one-for-one rule. This approach, which was discussed by the Red Tape Reduction Commission, requires the government to eliminate a regulation every time it adopts a new one. Once again, I would like to remind hon. members that there is no evidence of any reductions in red tape.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856396">However, the bill does not explicitly state that the regulations can apply to health and safety issues. In addition, the bill stipulates that the President of the Treasury Board has the power to calculate the cost of the administrative burden and determine how the law will apply to regulations changed when the one-for-one rule came into effect.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856397">It is clear just how much bargaining power is being given to the President of the Treasury Board. In other words, he could be granted discretionary powers over regulations affecting safety, health and the environment. Centralizing regulating and deregulating powers in the hands of the President of the Treasury Board is, without a doubt, an unsound, undesirable way to manage the public service.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856398">We are fully aware that we need to reduce red tape by offering balanced solutions to our entrepreneurs. However, we feel that this bill needs to be examined more closely in committee so that we can address its main weaknesses, including—and I have said this many times—the ability to protect the health and safety of Quebeckers and Canadians.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

That is pretty deceptive, and it is why I am somewhat pleased, but not unreservedly so.

I have lost track of the number of times that the <Affiliation DbId="194607" Type="4">Minister of State for Small Business and Tourism, and Agriculture</Affiliation> has announced, with great pomp and circumstance, that there would finally be a 20% reduction, that 96 items and 306 sub-items would be removed.

							<ParaText id="3856402">Despite all that, the NDP will support the bill at second reading. I would like to remind our listeners that second reading means that the bill will go to committee, where members can make suggestions and debate more tangible solutions to ensure that there really will be a reduction in the administrative burden for SME owners in Quebec and Canada.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856403">Just last Thursday, I was in Rivière-du-Loup, where the president of the Fonds de solidarité FTQ was giving a presentation. Among the 80 people in attendance were many small business owners. There was one entrepreneur in particular, a young man who got a small business up and running again five or six years ago.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856404">The business must be about 30 years old, and since the young man started it up again, it has gone from 30 to 120 employees. I know him, because I visited the company nearly two years ago, when I was the official opposition critic for SMEs. He said that business was good and that the Germans were interested in a product he developed a year ago.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856405">I asked him if he had had any support from Canada Economic Development, because it could be good if the Germans wanted to purchase cases or shiploads of his product. He said he had tried everything, but he would not do business with CED. I asked him why and he said it was so complicated that he gave up. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856406">Nonetheless, he had good things to say about other organizations. The CFDC helped him when it came to writing certain reports, but he gave up on Canada Economic Development. He now has a German purchase order to deal with and he has to find solutions and capital, but the red tape at Canada Economic Development forced him to give up on asking the federal government for help. That was just last week.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856407">This is something the party across the way has been going on about since at least 2007, but the results on the ground and within a number of federal services are more than disappointing for business owners. Bill <Document DbId="6390464" Type="3">C-21</Document> makes good on a promise made by this government in the Speech from the Throne to enshrine the one-for-one rule into law. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856408">When I hear “one-for-one” I think of the word “unbelievable”. I went to three media events across the country where Conservative ministers said they were finally going to reduce red tape using the one-for-one rule. In committee, I reminded the <Affiliation DbId="194607" Type="4">Minister of State for Small Business</Affiliation> that one minus one equals zero and that the government could not present a plan to reduce red tape when the only concrete solution on the table equals zero.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="20">(1820)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3856409">We need to be talking about negative numbers to be talking about a decrease. My nine-year-old son understands that. We need to be talking about negative one at some point in the process. We have before us a bill that is once again based on the idea that plus one minus one equals zero. However, were intellectually honest enough to call this a type of limitation. They dismissed the notion of reduction. They took a step in the right direction in terms of showing respect for Canadians' intelligence, but a step in the wrong direction for the well-being of Canada's entrepreneurs.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856410">The other arguments made by my colleagues deal with the lack of focus on the environment, for example. Given the Conservatives' values, they could use this to get rid of the regulations that they do not like and implement the ones they do. We do not have a lot of confidence in them when it comes to the environment or public safety. I completely agree with the concerns that many of my colleagues have raised since the debate on this bill began.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856411">I would like to use the last three minutes to talk about a possible way to find a solution and to let you know about Industry Canada's evaluation report of the BizPal service. According to the report, if we were to invest time, skills and money in the short term, this system could be very profitable for everyone in the long term. The idea is that entrepreneurs can go on online. They currently go into the BizPal system, to find the regulatory forms they need to make some sort of application, to confirm that they have complied with certain environmental regulations before building their restaurant, for example. In reality, 90% of the time they find the document that they have to print, fill out by hand and send by mail. They then have to wait for a response by phone or letter from a public servant. So much for 2.0. That is not even 1.0. Is there such a thing as Web .6? We are not even close. That is an example of a direction to take that would require investment. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856412">Allow me to give an example. When people need to fill out reports or do regulatory surveys and reports online, would it be possible to ensure, for example, that every time they type the SME business number—which would be assigned by the federal government— all of the information, including the owner's name, address, the date the business was set up, shows up on the screen? I have some news for the members opposite: if we invested the necessary resources, that would be possible in 2014-15. Crazy, right? With that kind of approach, if it is well carried out, it is feasible that small businesses could cut the time spent on regulatory administrative tasks by 20%, 30% or even 40%. There have not been any studies on it. I do not have the numbers, so I cannot tell you what it would cost. What I do know is that there are other administrations that have looked into tangible solutions like this one and that have invested good money. However, the return on investment is impressive when multiplied by the thousands of entrepreneurs who save hundreds of hours each year over decades. Altogether, it is very profitable, even if the initial investment is costly. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856413">We absolutely have to come up with real, complete solutions that will bring this information exchange with entrepreneurs in 2015 to the Web 2.0 level, and soon. We do not want to end up in 2035 with entrepreneurs who have someone working full-time behind the scenes printing forms and typing in the company's name every two weeks instead of serving customers. We have to achieve that objective as quickly as possible. The red tape reduction goal for SMEs is a top national priority, one we all share, and we have to make it really happen with real solutions.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856414"> I am also thinking of non-profits. I have met with people who run non-profit organizations with really important missions, such as literacy and supporting people with intellectual and health problems and so on. These people spend an inordinate amount of time justifying $1,400 grants. In any discussion of red tape, we have to consider all of the administrators in Canada, whether they work for non-profits or SMEs.</ParaText>

First of all, a lot of resources need to be allocated, reasonable resources, not tens of millions of dollars, to examine what we are up against. We must put in the time needed to make sure we know the cost of improving the sharing of information and progressing to Web 2.0.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856419">Next, we must be sure of our approach, sure of the desired results. Indeed, there have been some nationally integrated systems that have been disasters. Billions of dollars were invested to deliver something that went straight into the trash can because the intended users were not able to use it at all. This happened with many pieces of legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856420">We have to make the right choices so this does not happen again.

Unemployment remains high, and the jobs that are available are often too low-paying to live on.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856431">There are many reasons for the lack of good jobs in my region and across rural Canada. Part of it is the collapse of the forest industry and the effect of the economic downturn. Part of it, though, is the government's mismanagement of our economy, including a neglect of job creation and inflated EI rates, a job killer if there ever was one. Part of it is due to the bungled temporary foreign worker program.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856432">For several years now, we have been hearing stories of abuse of this program. At a Tim Hortons in Alberta, workers were flown in from other countries, and hundreds of qualified Canadians were ignored. A mining company in Murray River, British Columbia, hired 200 temporary Chinese miners after insisting that fluency in Mandarin was a necessary qualification for mining work.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856433">Many people do not know that the temporary foreign worker program has been in place for decades. It can work well in some limited circumstances if it responds to an actual need for truly temporary qualified workers, but the reality since the Conservatives came to power has been quite different. Since 2006, the Conservatives have expanded the temporary worker program, accelerated the application process, and brought in hundreds of thousands of foreign workers. Then the Conservatives inexplicably fast-tracked the program even further and admitted an additional 200,000 foreign workers. The total now, since the Conservatives took office, is over half a million temporary foreign workers.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856434">Then the Conservatives allowed temporary foreign workers to be paid 15% less than Canadian workers. Is that not just an abuse of foreign workers? With that change, the Conservatives started a race to the bottom, driving down Canadian wages as well. It is a lose–lose situation. After an outcry, the government reversed this change and it has started to undo some of the damage caused by the expansion of the temporary foreign worker program. However, this program still poses a threat to jobs for Canadians, especially in remote and rural areas, like my riding.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856435">The Ring of Fire mining development in northern Ontario has huge potential to generate wealth, but the jobs from northern Ontario's resources may not go to northern Ontarians. Instead of hiring or training local people, foreign miners may be brought in to do the work. This is a problem.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856436">Unemployment is particularly high among rural residents and the first nations that overwhelmingly populate the region near the Ring of Fire. The survival of many communities could depend on that development. Local residents must get first crack at local jobs. With proper support for training, especially in conjunction with first nations, the development could help entire communities pull themselves out of the cycle of poverty. It is good for the communities, developers, and the North and is good for Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856437">The Conservatives have been selling off our natural resources in raw, low-value form and have also neglected developing human resources over the past eight years. The Conservatives prefer to outsource as many jobs as possible. We must do more to develop a skilled Canadian workforce.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856438"> Will the minister commit to investing in the people of northern Ontario and across rural Canada? Will he assure us that temporary foreign workers will not be brought in to take jobs in the Ring of Fire?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="10">(1910)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Armstrong" id="8474235"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="194840" Type="18">Mr. Scott Armstrong (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Employment and Social Development, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3856439">Mr. Speaker, the simple answer to that question is yes. I can assure the hon. member that Canadians will always be considered first for projects in the Ring of Fire. Any employers asking to use the temporary foreign worker program will be required to show that these workers are being hired as a limited and last resort, a requirement that applies to all employers who apply for this program.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856440">It is completely unacceptable that Ontario's youth unemployment rate hovers between 16% and 17%, nearly three percentage points higher than the national average, but I also think we would be taking a short-sighted view if we believe that banning all temporary foreign workers from our work sites would somehow magically lower the unemployment rate among our youth.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856441">There is no doubt that the Ring of Fire in the mineral-rich James Bay lowlands in northern Ontario holds much promise for Canada and Ontario. Let us take a look at these facts. There are many challenges associated with the Ring of Fire mining development, not the least of which is the difficulty of accessing remote areas and a serious shortage of infrastructure such as roads, rail lines and broadband capacity. Addressing these deficits will require highly skilled people, from heavy equipment operators to engineers, from pipefitters to Internet technicians.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856442">The true issue then is what we can do to ensure that Canadians, including youth, can take full advantage of the job opportunities when they arise. The economic action plan provides an answer. In the last federal budget, we announced that our government is creating more opportunities for apprentices and supporting under-represented groups including youth. That is one reason we introduced the Canada job grant. It will help more people benefit from valuable skills training and allow more employers to develop the skilled workforce they need to keep contributing to the economic success of this country and Ontario.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856443">We are also introducing the Canada apprentice loan. This is estimated to help at least 26,000 apprentices each and every year. Connecting Canadians to the skilled training they need to fill available jobs is one of the best ways we can address labour shortages and fill the skills gap.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856444">In addition, just last year in the member's riding of <Affiliation DbId="170584" Type="2">Thunder Bay—Superior North</Affiliation>, we announced a $5.9 million contribution to KKETS employment training services so that aboriginal people in the Ring of Fire can get the skills and training they need to find good-quality, high-paying jobs in the mining industry, jobs such as heavy equipment operators, underground diamond drillers and environmental monitors. This investment in training is urgently needed in a region where over 40% of the employers said they could not fill a job due to a shortage of qualified people.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856445"> I will repeat, any employer who wishes to use the temporary foreign worker program must comply with strict criteria to ensure that Canadians will have first crack at all available jobs. We will continue to pursue significant reforms to the temporary foreign worker program to ensure that employers make greater efforts to recruit and train Canadians. This program is to be used as a last and limited resort only when Canadians are not available.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The government must stop trying to justify its mismanagement of the program and instead focus its energies on supporting local workers there and across Canada. When northern Ontarians are provided the opportunity to develop their skills, develop that region and other rural areas, and contribute to the economy, everybody will win.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856448">Will the government please take advantage of this chance to support our workers, our youth, our citizens, and ensure that no temporary foreign workers will be brought in to take their jobs in the Ring of Fire?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Jobs should, wherever possible, go to qualified locals such as youth and aboriginal people.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856450">In the last budget, as I said in my previous remarks, we invested a great deal in resources to help train people for available jobs. I would ask the member, when we bring these initiatives forward, can we count on his support to vote for those resources being allocated to train people in northern Ontario so they will be trained and ready for those jobs when those jobs come to fruition?</ParaText><ParaText id="3856451">The Ring of Fire holds tremendous economic promise for aboriginal communities, for the Mattawa First Nations of northern Ontario in particular. That is why we support aboriginal people in gaining the skills needed in a rapidly growing mining industry through partnerships such as the one we have with the KKETS, Noront Resources Ltd, and the Confederation College in Thunder Bay, which includes a total of $5.9 million in funding.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856452">Any employer who wishes to use the temporary foreign worker program must comply with strict criteria to ensure that Canadians will have first crack at those jobs.

Two weeks ago, I asked the <Affiliation DbId="194617" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> to reassure the people and the fishers in Chaleur Bay, a waterway between Quebec and New Brunswick that falls under federal jurisdiction, about the dredging of the port that will have to be done to accommodate the tankers. </ParaText><ParaText id="3856454">The Chaleur Terminals report sent to the Department of the Environment is silent on the issue of the toxic sediments that will be dredged up during the process. Will those sediments be thrown into the sea, right in the middle of the fishing grounds?</ParaText><ParaText id="3856455">Studies show that immersing dredged materials is a way of transferring contaminants into the marine environment. Since October 7, the company has announced that dredging will not be necessary in the initial phases of the project, since only smaller tankers will be received in the port. The process is being pushed back, which will only allow other toxic sediment to build up on the seabed. Among the chemical contaminants that can be found in this sediment are heavy metals such as arsenic, chrome, mercury, lead, tributyltin, known for its harmful effects on shellfish, as well as  PCBs.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856456">Of course, dredging is vital to the operation of a port economy, and every port experiences siltation, but dredging should not be done without taking into consideration the protection of coastal and marine ecosystems. Dredging to deepen the harbour, which would be the case in Belledune, requires moving large quantities of sediment, and the disposal of the dredge spoils causes many technical and environmental problems. Special attention must therefore be paid to dredging operations carried out near sensitive areas, such as Chaleur Bay.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856457">In addition to chemical pollution, there are also bacteriological and viral risks associated with dredging the port of Belledune since many municipalities dump their waste water, which is more or less treated, directly into the bay. This water contains many bacteria and viruses, some of which are fecal in origin and pathogenic and can be transmitted to people who go swimming in the bay or eat shellfish caught there. Some of these micro-organisms are diluted in the water of the bay while others attach themselves to particles and are deposited in muddy areas.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856458">The sediment floating in the water as a result of dredging can contain the following flora: salmonella, E. coli, fecal streptococci, type E botulism, the cholera bacillus, and many other bacteria that are potentially harmful to human health. With regard to viruses, I would like to mention the virus responsible for gastroenteritis and the one responsible for hepatitis A. What is more, long-term exposure to high concentrations of heavy metals can cause these bacteria to develop a resistance to these metals and other substances such as antibiotics.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856459">The bay is known for its beaches and temperate waters, which are enjoyed by local swimmers and tourists and serve as an important reservoir for the reproduction of pelagic species. Finally, over the past 20 years or so, the bay has also allowed for the development of the mariculture industry, which has the potential to become a gold mine for the region.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856460">Does the Conservative government intend to take into account people's concerns and the risks associated with setting up an oil terminal in Belledune? Does it intend to conduct the assessments required and hold the necessary consultations before this project is implemented? Will it listen to the people in the community?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The Belledune rail terminal and transfer system project consists of buildings and infrastructure required to receive petroleum products by rail, store them on site, and load them onto marine vessels for shipment through Belledune's terminal 2.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856464">A science-based environmental assessment review of the project was undertaken by the Province of New Brunswick. The environment department was given the opportunity to comment on environmental emergencies, oil spill prevention, preparedness and response, potential spills at sea, dredge materials, migratory birds, wildlife species at risk, and air quality. Those comments were offered for consideration in the planning, construction, and operation of the proposed project.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856465">The disposal of dredged spoils into the sea would require the proponent to contact Environment Canada to verify whether such a permit is required under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3856466">I would also like to mention that under the government's responsible resource development plan, rigorous environmental protection measures are being implemented to ensure the sustainable development of our natural resources. This includes ensuring the protection of the environment at the proposed Belledune rail terminal and transfer system.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856467">The government has already taken major steps to enhance an already robust oil tanker safety system regime and created a world-class regime that protects both coastal communities and our environment.</ParaText><ParaText id="3856468">As the member may know, Environment Canada has a mandate to protect the environment from emergency pollution incidents and takes water pollution very seriously. Environment Canada enforces strong environmental laws, such as the Fisheries Act, and this government would enforce any laws or regulations that may have been violated as a result of a spill and ensure that the parties responsible would take responsibility to remedy any damage.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I do not understand why the government cannot make a decision today on the feasibility of the dredging and on what will be done with the spoils. The facts are there. The dredging will happen, and the government will have to make a decision.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
