It would have a comprehensive reform to many clauses. It would impose the duty to create records. It would introduce a public interest override in the application of the Access to Information Act and would create the situation where cabinet confidences would no longer be excluded automatically from the scrutiny of the Access to Information Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125551">I should point out that every clause in the bill was written by the former information commissioner, Mr. John Reid, and his staff. It has been endorsed by Justice Gomery and by the Conservative Party of Canada because every clause in the bill was in the campaign literature in the 2006 federal election campaign where the Conservatives promised specifically to introduce every aspect of John Reid's open government act.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1125558">Mr. Speaker, I have the honour to present, in both official languages, the third report of the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration presented on Thursday, December 13, 2007, and I should like to move concurrence at this time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125559">Mr. Speaker, I wish to split my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78654" Type="2">Burnaby—New Westminster</Affiliation>, who actually moved a motion at the Immigration and Citizenship committee about a year and a half ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125560">We know that Iraq war resisters, who have refused to fight George W. Bush's illegal war, have been stuck in limbo in Canada for years. Canadians are proud of our history of opening our doors to Vietnam war resisters. We are equally united in saying no to George Bush's illegal invasion of Iraq. Today can be another landmark for Canadians as the day when the Parliament of Canada finally allowed war resisters to stay.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125561">War resisters tell us that they joined the armed forces to escape poverty and make ends meet, and to protect their country, but not to break international law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125562"> Phillip McDowell, one of the many war resisters in Canada, said, “I joined the military to defend my country. I didn't join or volunteer to take part in an illegal war or a war of aggression”. He adds that, to him, the war is unjust. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125563">Kim Rivera recounts why she joined the army. She said, “I was working at Wal-Mart in Fort Worth, Texas, my home town. My husband and I have two small children, and I had to help make ends meet. But I ran into a glass ceiling at Wal-Mart and couldn't earn enough. I decided to join the army so I could get an adequate income, job training, and health care for my family”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125564">Like many others, Rivera was misinformed. As a mother of two, she was ensured by her recruiter that women were rarely deployed to combat zones. Less than a year later, she was in Iraq. She said, “the army told me I wouldn't be sent into combat, but once I got to Iraq I was under enemy fire every day”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125565">The conditions in Iraq severely traumatized Rivera. She recounts one incident when an Iraqi woman who became her friend was badly wounded. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125566">As a mother and wife, Rivera faced multiple barriers. She recounts, “the Army had no regard for my role as a wife and mother. I tried to keep in touch with my family by phone, but it isn't the same as being together. Once I got frustrated and had an argument with my husband. A sergeant overheard me and told me I should get a divorce. He even put separation papers in front of me and told me to fill them out! But I love my husband and I want most of all to keep my family together”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125567">Like many others, Rivera and her family decided to leave. She explains, “on leave back in the U.S., my husband and I decided the war was wrong based on our values as Christians, and the Army was tearing my family apart. We decided that we would go to Canada, where we heard there were other families like ours”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125568">U.S. war resisters, like Rivera, tell us many disturbing tales about the Bush government's illegal war in Iraq.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125569">Phillip McDowell, who is a former sergeant in the United States army, is one of the many resisters who has first-hand experience on the front lines in Iraq. He stated, “throughout my tour, I was told to run civilian cars off the road if they got in the way. I saw the mistreatment of Iraqi civilians or detainees who I found out later had done nothing wrong at all. I saw more evil being brought to the country that we were supposed to be liberating”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125570">Christopher Magaoay, a former lance corporal in the Marine Corps, echoes McDowell's story. He states, “I was trained and told to train others on how to cover up the killing of non-combatants”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125571">I will tell members who these non-combatants were. They were innocent civilians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125572">He goes on to state, “We were told to place shovels, shrapnel and any small arms available next to these bodies. Our instructions were to justify our kills by saying that the deceased was attempting to plant an improvised explosive device and to point to the planted evidence”.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1125573">Let us imagine that. Like the other conscientious objectors, Mr. Magaoay had to make a very difficult choice. He said: “I had to make a decision in my life to choose between committing what I know to be crimes under both military and international law or to leave. I couldn't live with myself knowing that I was a part of killing innocent civilians. I know the nightmares that follow the faces of the dead; I chose the path of resistance by coming to Canada”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125574">Deciding to leave the army, the navy or the marines is never an easy decision for a soldier. In speaking about his decision to leave the army after nine years, Patrick Hart, a supply sergeant who served in Germany, the U.S., and Kuwait after the invasion of Iraq, stated: “I realized I just couldn't continue to be part of the Army any more. It was a hard decision, but in August 2006 I crossed the border from Buffalo, my home town, and came to Toronto”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125575">Let me tell members that Mr. Hart and his family are contributing daily to the neighbourhood where he lives, which happens to be in my riding of Trinity—Spadina.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125576">Many resisters served their terms of duty in Iraq and vow never to return to any more war. Mr. McDowell explains that when he came back from Iraq: “I was determined not to have any part in this at all. I was determined that when my contract was up with the military, when my volunteer service was over, I was going to separate and not be in the military anymore.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125577">Patrick Hart, who has a child and a wife, explains the reasons that led him to resist serving in Iraq. He said: “While I was in Kuwait I spoke to many of the soldiers who had been to Iraq. When I heard about some of the things they did, [it was] really upsetting, especially what happened to children caught in the fighting. I thought of my son Ryan and realized how horrible it must be for Iraqi parents”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125578">Leaving the armed forces or getting a reassignment is not an option for war resisters. McDowell told the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration that “in the United States military, if a U.S. soldier develops a conscientious objection to a particular war, there is no avenue for him to seek reassignment or transfer to some other place”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125579">He recounts his own experience after completing his service in June 2006: “I was called back into service involuntarily under the army's Stop Loss policy”. He said, “I was told that I was going to have a 15-month tour in Iraq”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125580">Disappointed, Mr. McDowell tried to find a way out. He explained: “I told my chain of command that I disagreed with the war and that I didn't want to go. I said I would be in the military and do something in the States, as long as I didn't go to Iraq. They said I did not have a choice; I was going to Iraq”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125581">Like many other resisters, Mr. McDowell turned to Canada for help. He explains that “knowing that Canada did not participate in the Iraq War and that it made that decision because the United Nations didn't approve of it, and knowing, myself, that the UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in 2004, declared the war illegal, I thought it was right for me to move to Canada to take this decision”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125582">The choice to leave their country, their jobs and their communities also affects the families of these war resisters. Hart, who lives in my riding, said: “--when I told my wife Jill about my decision to leave the Army, she was really upset, but I'm glad to say she decided to join me in Canada”. Their son is in a local school, at Dewson. They are fundraising for the epilepsy association. Jill was the president of the housing co-op. They are volunteering. They are working. Jill is working as a manager of a very popular place, the Lula Lounge, a very famous place where musicians play in Toronto.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125583">Let me tell members that these four Iraq war resisters have said that their stories are not unique and that there are many other resisters here. Another one who served is Chuck Wiley. He served in the army for 17 years. He is a veteran. He decided to leave when he learned that his ship's actions were in contravention of the Geneva Convention.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1125590">However, I can tell members that the War Resisters Support Campaign has received 40,000 signatures on a petition asking that they be allowed to stay in Canada. A poll from June 2007 shows that 64.6% of Ontarians, including supporters from all major political parties, agree that war resisters should be allowed to stay in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125591">I believe that we really have to resolve this with a political solution and not hide behind the Immigration and Refugee Board, because, after all, the board members are appointees of the government and tend to have certain political views. We know that our country's principled commitment to peace and fairness is a tradition, because we allowed 50,000 U.S. war resisters to stay in Canada during the Vietnam war.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1125595">As for volunteer soldiers in the United States who have difficulty with the mission they are on, first of all, soldiers do not get to vote for which missions they go on. They are assigned by their legal government, which is making legal decisions. If they have difficulty with that and want to fight the system, that is fine. That is their option. Why do they not fight it within their own country in their own legal system instead of being faux refugees in Canada? </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1125596">Mr. Speaker, let me say first that in the 1960s and 1970s during the war in Vietnam it was not just the people who were drafted who came to Canada. In fact, people who went to war voluntarily also came to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125597">It is unfortunate that I do not have enough time, because I could give hon. members the history of how the decisions were made. Early in 1969, a memo was discussed in cabinet. There were all sorts of debates at that time. Originally the government of the day said no, but people in Canada rose up and said that it was really important to decide which side Canada was on. Were we on the side of the United States in the war in Vietnam or would we allow the draft dodgers and the war resisters to stay in Canada?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125598"> During that time, Canadians spoke out so loudly and clearly that the government, which initially said no throughout the early 1970s, then changed its mind. After two or three major decisions, it allowed all soldiers and their family members to stay in Canada. They were not just people who had been drafted. Some of them volunteered to go into the army.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125599">That is the history of this in Canada. I hope the Conservative government listens to the stories of these families. They are facing jail terms when they return to the United States. That means they would have criminal records, which means they would not be able to get jobs. They would not be able to get a mortgage. Their entire lives would be destroyed.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1125601">Just for the record, in that report the committee recommends:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125602">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">--that the government immediately implement a program to allow conscientious objectors and their immediate family members (partners and dependents), who have refused or left military service related to a war not sanctioned by the United Nations and do not have a criminal record, to apply for permanent resident status and remain in Canada; and that the government should immediately cease any removal or deportation actions that may have already commenced against such individuals.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125603">This is a very important report from the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration. I am glad that the standing committee was able to finally make that clear statement about the need to offer a welcome to war resisters, war resisters to the war in Iraq, American war resisters here in Canada, and that it garnered the support of all the opposition parties on the committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125604">The committee considered this for some time. Early attempts that I made to raise this issue were not as successful as recent ones, often spearheaded by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78598" Type="2">Trinity—Spadina</Affiliation>, so I am very glad that we are here today to discuss this majority report of the standing committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125605">Canada needs people of conscience. We have been well served by such people who have taken a stand on an important issue of principle, a stand for peace, a stand for truth and accountability of government, and a stand against militarism. In the case of Iraqi war resisters who are currently coming to Canada, their conscientious objection has not been recognized in the United States. It has not been recognized through the conscientious objection process of the U.S. military.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125606">I think we also want to say that wherever we have military forces we want soldiers who do not check their conscience at the recruiting office doors. We need people in the armed forces who act out of full conscience. That is what these American war resisters are doing. As such, as people of conscience, they should receive a welcome in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125607">It is very clear that Canadians do not support the war in Iraq. That has been shown time and time again across this country. Many of us believe that it is an illegal war, and Canada rightly refused to participate in that war. Our government made the right decision to not participate in the war in Iraq. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125608">It is now very clear that the United States and President Bush lied, I do not think it is too strong to say, about the situation in Iraq prior to the invasion. They lied about the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. They lied that this fight was against al-Qaeda or that it was a war on terrorism. Even as recently as yesterday, we saw that President Bush's own messengers, the people who were communications spokespeople in his office, are now admitting their role in promoting this misrepresentation and admitting that they helped promote a war for different reasons than those publicly stated by the U.S. administration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125609">There is no doubt that the Saddam Hussein regime was a problem, to say the least, but the invasion on false pretences and the ongoing war were and are wrong and have done nothing to improve the lives of ordinary Iraqis. In fact, the situation is much, much worse for ordinary Iraqis today. This war is a terrible mistake, something that Americans themselves are increasingly aware of, and the dramatic decline in support for the war in the United States is clear evidence of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125610">Many patriotic Americans signed on with their armed forces because they believed what they were told by their leaders. After serving in Iraq, they came to know the truth and decided they could no longer in good conscience participate. We should listen to their stories. The member for <Affiliation DbId="78598" Type="2">Trinity—Spadina</Affiliation> told some of those stories this morning. They speak clearly to the horror of war and the way these honourable people struggled with their personal responsibility for that war.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125611">Many of those folks signed on to the military because that was their only way of getting an education and their only way out of poverty and difficult financial circumstances. After serving a tour of duty, many are being forced back to Iraq against their conscience by the stop loss program, which extends their deployment beyond anything contemplated when they enlisted. This is another serious problem that these people face with the process in the American military. None of this is acceptable.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="30">(1030)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1125612">These war resisters are people who can make a huge contribution to Canada and who share key values with Canadians, values that have taught them to struggle to do what is right and resist what is wrong, values that lead them to want to support a path of peace rather than war, values that value life over death, and values that seek the best for their country and hold it to high ideals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125613">Canada has benefited often from such refugees and immigrants many times in our history. Mennonites, Doukhobors, Vietnam war resisters have all made significant contributions to our country and our communities. I do not think anyone would deny this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125614">Canada made it possible for over 100,000 Vietnam war resisters to find a haven from militarism here in Canada. New Democrats were early supporters of extending that welcome. Former Prime Minister Trudeau actively sought that solution eventually and stated that Canada should be a haven from militarism during the Vietnam war. Over 50,000 of those folks remained in Canada. I am constantly amazed and impressed at where I meet them and the kind of contribution they are making to this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125615">Canada did well by that migration. Canada did well by our decision to welcome those young men and women of conscience. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125616">This is one way Canada can be an agent for peace in the world. We can make a statement by extending a welcome to Iraq war resisters, and indeed resisters of war in other situations and other conflicts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125617">I believe Canadians strongly support such an action. There must be a special immigration program for conscientious objectors. We must allow them a safe haven. We must ensure that people from countries that are unwilling to recognize conscientious objection find a welcome here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125618">I have said that Canadians support this. I have tabled petitions here in the House from 15,000 Canadians back in June 2005 who called for exactly this kind of welcome for U.S. war resisters. I know other MPs have tabled petitions with many more signatures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125619">The war resister support campaign is working across Canada in many different communities to support war resisters and to extend support to the broader community for them. Thousands of people in Canada have endorsed their declaration. Many have contributed financially to the ongoing support of war resisters. They have also lobbied many of us here in the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125620">Back on May 15 it was International Conscientious Objection Day. This day is important to many people who are conscientious objectors to war and militarism here in Canada. Along with some of those people that I have worked with, we have developed a bill called the conscientious objection act or more commonly known as the peace tax bill, where people of conscience would have the opportunity to divert some of their income tax away from military purposes and place it in a peace tax fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125621">This bill was developed in cooperation with people from Conscience Canada, Quakers, Mennonites, the Mennonite Central Committee and Nos impôts pour la paix.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125622">I think there is also a very important statement from the United Church of Canada, the Canadian Friends Service Committee, the Mennonite Central Committee and the Canadian Friends Service Committee and the yearly meeting of the Religious Society of Friends, the Quakers. It is an aspect that is regularly raised by the war resister support campaign as a major principle of that campaign. The churches say in this letter:</ParaText>

The Nuremberg principles established that soldiers have a duty not a choice to refuse to carry out immoral orders.

              <ParaText id="1125641">Mr. Speaker, the concern has arisen and the reason we are discussing this report today is specifically because of American citizens who were in the American armed forces and made a decision of conscience not to participate further in the war in Iraq. They have refused redeployment to Iraq and, as such, are resisters of that particular war. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125642">However, they are at the same time conscientious objectors and many of them have actually engaged the conscientious objection process in the American military, unsuccessfully unfortunately. When we listen to the stories of how that process unfolded for many of them, it is hard to believe that the articulate and deeply held convictions that they brought to those commissions and the requests for conscientious objector status were not heard by the American authorities making those decisions.</ParaText>

They are people who, through a long period of struggle, came to a very important decision in their own lives and are now seeking our support to honour that very difficult decision they came to and to protect their lives.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="78959" Type="18">Mr. Ed Komarnicki (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1125644">Mr. Speaker, the first question I posed was whether the persons contemplated in the motion are the types who would have applied under our refugee protection legislation and the answer was yes, they would have gone through that process. As the hon. member mentioned in his speech, there is a process of course in the United States, a due process for conscientious objectors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125645">The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, in the handbook, calls for consideration of whether a resister was drafted or joined the army voluntarily and those coming to Canada now have volunteered for military service, just as the member for <Affiliation DbId="78712" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> has indicated. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125646">The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has indicated that Canada is really a model to the rest of the world in terms of the refugee protection system that it has. Of course, it is intended to protect refugees who genuinely fear persecution, the threat of torture and, in certain cases, death. It is for that purpose that we have the system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125647">We have a board that hears the refugee application and all of the circumstances related to it. In the event of a negative decision, the decision of the board can be appealed with leave to the Federal Court of Appeal and, if leave is granted, can be heard at the Federal Court of Appeal. In fact, if that process is gone through and there is a negative decision in the Federal Court, an appeal can be made to the Supreme Court of Canada for a decision on that as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125648">We know that many have gone through that process and have received negative decisions. Then our refugee protection due process allows for applications to be made under humanitarian and compassionate grounds. In many cases, applications have been made on humanitarian and compassionate grounds and on more than one occasion all of the factors that may apply to the case or have an issue of compassion to it are presented and heard. In the event of a negative decision in that case, there is also an opportunity to apply for a pre-removal risk assessment before the person is returned to his or her country after all of that due process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125649">Indeed, legislation has been proposed and is going through the Senate with respect to a refugee appeal division, which is another layer of process. This does not happen at the same time but at various times, to such a point that some cases take years to complete and the confidence of the system starts to be called into question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125650">Through this report, the opposition would have the government allow a small and discrete group of people to completely bypass both the refugee determination process and our system of judicial review, both of which have uniformly rejected their claims of being in need of protection. Not only does the opposition want us to allow a shortcut around the refugee system, it would have the government create a special queue jumping loophole in our immigration process to allow these people to stay here legally while they flout the laws of their own country and renege on their voluntary commitments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125651">Right now, Canada has a fair, internationally recognized system for providing refuge to those fleeing persecution. We are committed to protecting refugees. However, Canadians want a refugee system that helps true refugees. This means we must ensure the system is there for those who genuinely need it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125652">There is no compelling reason to undermine the integrity, the fairness, and the consistency of our immigration and refugee protection programs in order to provide a special and unique benefit to the claimants that are referred to in the motion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125653">That said, I would therefore move:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1125669">Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the parliamentary secretary because I do find his remarks to be of great concern.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125670">The parliamentary secretary went on about the various processes that he says are available to people like the war resisters. He talked about the conscientious objection process that is available in the American military. He talked about our refugee process here. It is the failure of those processes that led us to this very motion today. It is the fact that they do not work, and they have not worked, to protect people of conscience. That clearly has been the experience of people who came to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125671">He also made an incredible statement, that the proposed legislation on the refugee appeal division was now before the Senate. The parliamentary secretary knows that is part of the current Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and what is before the Senate is a bill calling on the government to implement legislation that has already been passed by the House of Commons and the Senate, which is an outrageous statement in itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125672">If this process has the integrity that the parliamentary secretary says it does, why did the government move to disallow any consideration of the legality of the war in Iraq from the process? Why do thousands and thousands of Canadians want to see a particular process that would allow war resisters to remain in Canada because they are people of conscience?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1125675">It is not so much an issue of a failure of process. We have a number of processes and I have outlined them: a hearing before a board and potentially an appeal from the board; leave to appeal to the Federal Court; an appeal to the Federal Court; an application to the Supreme Court; a humanitarian and compassionate grounds application, more than once; a pre-removal risk assessment. If a person receives a negative decision, at some point the person has to respect that. What the member is saying is that if they do not like a decision, they would like a program developed to add yet another layer to ensure that they could succeed, if that is what they want. It is not a failure of process. Adding another layer to the process certainly is not what is necessary. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125676">The court has ruled on this issue saying that someone who, during his or her time in the military, develops an objection after he or she has volunteered is not entitled to refugee protection as we know it. There is a process that should be followed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125677"> Does the member not agree that the process should be followed? At some point, when a negative decision is received, one would expect the person to respect the negative decision and leave the country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1125682">Mr. Speaker, the definition of what a refugee is or is not is well defined in our law and it has been interpreted by a variety of courts. The definition is well settled in the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The UNHCR has stated that our system is a model system for the rest of the world in terms of its generosity, its fairness, and the broadness of its extent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125683">The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees handbook calls for the consideration of whether a resister was drafted or joined the army voluntarily. Those now coming to Canada volunteered for military service. When one volunteers and then later develops some objection, that in and of itself would not allow the person to qualify as a refugee in the true sense as it is meant to mean and as it is defined. In fact, a number of individuals had the benefit of the interpretation not only by a board, but the Federal Court and the Supreme Court of Canada also commented on these issues. The handbook makes a distinction and for good reason. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125684">At some point, as I have said, when a person goes through the process, he or she either fits the category or does not. If the person fails and receives a negative decision, our generous system has other options. There are other processes that can be used to determine, notwithstanding that, could an application still be made on humanitarian or compassionate grounds. A full hearing is entitled and on some occasions more than once. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125685">At some point with all of these existing processes, due process must prevail. When a negative decision is received, at some point it needs to be respected. That is primarily the point we are making. It is a point that not only is well made but it is an important point if we want to ensure the continued integrity of our system and if we want to have the support of Canadians who want to see a system that is not only respected but is followed.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1125688">Mr. Speaker, there is no question that the refugee appeal division is provided for and is something that would require enactment. That essentially is what the bill allows. It is another layer put forward by members that would extend the whole process by an additional five months. Presently it sometimes takes five, six or seven years to determine the outcome of a specific case. By adding another layer and not fixing the rest, all we would be doing is simply adding more time to a process that is already not proceeding as efficiently as it should. That process will be there. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125689">In addition to all the existing processes and that process, this motion is asking for yet another process. If a negative decision is received, it could be appealed with leave to the Federal Court of Appeal and perhaps the Supreme Court of Canada. This would be yet another layer in a due process system that already takes years, not months. That simply is not appropriate.</ParaText>

I determined that when my contract was up with the military, when my volunteer service was over, I was going to separate and not be in the military anymore. However, after I did that in June 2006, I was called back into service involuntarily under the army's Stop Loss policy. I was told that I was going to have a 15-month tour in Iraq. I told my chain of command that I disagreed with the war and that I didn't want to go....I tried to contact my elected officials to explain to them how I felt about that. They said, sorry, there were a lot of people in the same situation, that I didn't have a choice, and that I was going to Iraq.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="1125714">There are many other resisters in Canada who have come to seek refuge. Among them are Patrick Hart, an army sergeant with nine years of service, Chuck Wylie who was chief petty officer with 17 years of service, Dean Walcott who was a field marine deployed in the initial invasion of Iraq, Kim Rivera, a mother of two who was told by her recruiter that women were rarely deployed to combat zones. Less than a year later, she was in Iraq, unable to cope with the abuse and indiscriminate violence she witnessed. Among others was Jeremy Hinzman who applied for conscientious objector status. He asked for non-combat duty and was denied.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125715">People may ask what is the stop loss policy? Let me explain. In the United States military, stop loss, as Mr. McDowell explains, is the involuntary extension of a service member's active duty service under the enlistment contract in order to retain them beyond their initial end of term service date.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125716">The problem for individuals such as Mr. McDowell is the military service has in fact become involuntary. Many conscientious objectors, such as Phillip McDowell, come to Canada much like the soldiers who deserted during the Vietnam war in search of shelter and safety. In fact, former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau welcomed such soldiers as he believed that Canada should be a refuge from military. </ParaText>

However, if he were to suggest that a new program should be undertaken, would he prevent applications from being made under the basis of a refugee or would he still want to have the same processes that are available to make an application as a refugee and, alongside that, if there was a failure in a positive decision, that the program should also be implemented, or is one exclusive to the other, knowing that presently if a negative decision is received with respect to the determination of refugee, the person can apply by leave and with leave to the Federal Court, the Supreme Court of Canada, and if that fails and the person gets a negative decision, the person can apply under humanitarian and compassionate grounds, and that would be notwithstanding a negative decision?

When the door exploded inward, a 10-year-old female was hit with shrapnel and wood splinters in the face, neck and abdomen.

              <ParaText id="1125775">Mr. Speaker, I am happy to speak today and return to my first love. In fact, until just recently, I was the Bloc Québécois citizenship and immigration critic. It is therefore a pleasure for me to talk about an issue that is close to the hearts of many Quebeckers and Canadians. Moreover, a number of young people from my riding, Vaudreuil-Soulanges, are here today, and I will have the opportunity to talk to them and discuss this issue. I would therefore like to thank my colleagues for giving us the opportunity to hold a debate today about conscientious objectors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125776">The deportation order against Corey Glass, a deserter from the war in Iraq who is living in the Toronto area, has reopened the debate. I am happy about what I have heard here from the opposition members. My friends from <Affiliation DbId="78688" Type="2">Vaughan</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="78401" Type="2">Scarborough—Agincourt</Affiliation>, as well as my NDP colleagues, have described the cases that are before us and about which groups are asking parliamentarians to make a decision. In my opinion, this is a political decision that could change the course of these people's lives. The principle on which their claims are based is laudable and justifiable, as the member for Vaughan said in his speech.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1125780">I would now like to talk about certain factors which support war resisters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125781">In the past three years, people opposed to the U.S. war in Iraq who have been living here in Canada have had the opportunity to talk to a number of people here. About 50 people living here have been involved. I would like to commend them on having the courage to uphold principles of international law, principles of solidarity and humanitarian principles. These are great values shared by the parliamentarians here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125782">I do not want their words to be forgotten. These people came to speak to us. In their opinion, the war in Iraq is illegal and immoral. Some came to that conclusion after their experience on the ground in Iraq, while others came to that same conclusion based on what they read, namely accounts by other soldiers who have returned from Iraq. Their claims were also backed by certain facts and events, including Colin Powell's outburst.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125783">This is a sensitive issue because it affects our relationship with the United States and could also affect our relationships with other countries. As far as the issue of conscientious objectors is concerned, one of the basic problems that always brings us back to this type of debate is the lack of clear direction in Canada's foreign policy.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1125784">This policy has not been implemented for almost 10 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125785">Other factors at play include the review of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act following the attacks in 2001. Instead of allowing the borders to remain open for humanitarian or family reasons, Canada stepped up its border controls and increased its munitions. It is closing its borders and fewer and fewer refugee claims on humanitarian grounds are being properly considered here in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125786">The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act poses a basic problem. The Bloc Québécois was opposed to it then for the same reasons it is now. Our evidence shows that we were right at the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125787">Since the 1990s, the global economy and the international political scene have had their share of upheavals that have had an impact on Canada's role in the world. For the past 10 years, the Government of Canada has not conducted an indepth public review of its foreign policy and its defence policy. A policy incorporates the values we want to the defend and the principles on which we can make our decisions, whether it is a matter of regulations or other measures. A real reform is needed, preceded by real consultations with the elected members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125788">Nowadays, issues are being brought up one by one. That is why people get the sense that everything is so complicated, and things get bogged down in endless processes and procedures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125789">Our Conservative Party colleague talked about what he would do with the soldiers and what would happen if we were to adopt a policy toward conscientious objectors. We already have a basic principle to inform our decisions. These considerations have to do with multilateralism and peacekeeping.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125790">We have to consider Canada's position on the war in Iraq and base the decision we make today on that. These factors also influenced the decisions made by those who resisted the American war in Iraq.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125791">Witnesses who appeared before the committee brought up three main points. First, in March 2003, the Canadian government decided not to send more troops to participate in the United States' invasion and occupation of Iraq.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125792">Second, Canada welcomed resistors during the Vietnam war, a chapter in history that is relatively well known in the United States and that created a historical precedent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125793">The third point involved people who have been the subject of significant international media coverage and who made it possible for members of the American armed forces to gain access to information about what was really going on on the ground.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125794">I would like to talk more about the Vietnam war. We have to put ourselves in the shoes of parliamentarians of the day. I had the text of the debates held in 1969 printed, and what people were saying back then in Parliament is the same as what we are hearing now. Some members were wondering about how to build soldiers' loyalty and deal with international relations with other countries. Others were worried that officers or soldiers who had committed serious crimes or crimes against humanity might wind up here in Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1125795">But a policy was implemented at the time and thousands of deserters were able to come to Canada. This brings me to the question of immigration. At the time, the Immigration Act was different. When people submitted documents explaining their opinion and what led them to decide to be conscientious objectors, the act allowed them to apply here and those people were allowed normal entry to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125796">I would also like to thank these people, because many of them had the courage to come and appear before the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration, precisely to tell us how they have contributed to this country by passing on pacifist and humanitarian values. Many are now emeritus professors at Canadian universities. I would therefore like to sincerely thank them, on behalf of deserters who were conscientious objectors, for their contributions. The committee concluded that the government could implement some measures. In this case, under existing legislation, these exceptional measures could allow conscientious objectors to come to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125797">I do not know what time it was when I began my speech, but I would like to take this opportunity to remind this House that, this year, the United Nations made a specific commitment to peace. The Bloc Québécois defends Quebec's values and I believe many people in the other provinces also share the values generally espoused in Quebec, which include respect for the rights of individuals and of peoples, freedom, solidarity and peaceful resolution of conflicts. These values are deeply entrenched in Quebec and have been passionately expressed, for instance, during the debate surrounding the war in Iraq, which illustrates just how willing people are to denounce illegal wars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125798">We need only recall the 250,000 people who braved the cold to demonstrate in Montreal and the polls that showed major opposition to the war at that time. We managed to change political positions in terms of foreign affairs and our policy on the war in Iraq.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125799">We can now reaffirm these values because the United Nations has proclaimed 2001 to 2010 as the International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World. I think that this is a golden opportunity to educate and act in the spirit of non-violence and peace by recognizing the requests of these conscientious objectors and drawing on the wisdom of 1969. At that time, during the Vietnam War, Canada showed clemency and allowed thousands of people—I would like to speak of people and not cases—to establish themselves in Canada and make a positive contribution to the country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1125801">We are in favour of conscientious objectors staying in Canada. We are in favour of creating a mechanism to examine their applications. We would like the House to have the same attitude as it had in 1969. The government must show leadership and recognize, once and for all, the events of the war in Iraq. It must develop a policy to recognize the rights of these people who, by the way, have worked hard for the recognition of their rights using the means available to them. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1125803">Mr. Speaker, the member talked about what happened in the sixties and seventies with the soldiers who did not want to fight in the Vietnam war.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125804">In May 1969 the immigration department was opposed to giving military resisters and deserters a free passage to permanent residence in Canada. In July 1968, when Mr. Allan MacEachen became the minister of immigration, he put out a memo that said military deserters were not to be accepted because they had not kept their moral, legal and contractual obligations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125805">Subsequently, there was a huge outrage in Canada. Between July 1968 and May 1969, many Canadians said that was not acceptable. Canadians wanted these war resisters to stay in Canada. This was during the Vietnam war.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125806">Subsequently, in May 1969, because of the outcry from ordinary Canadians, a memo was sent out by the minister of immigration which said that whether they were military deserters or draft resisters, whether they volunteered for service or were drafted, it did not matter, they were now allowed to stay in Canada. That was in May 1969. In November 1972 every person was allowed and there was a general amnesty for all people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125807">The situation right now is close to being identical to the time of the war in Vietnam, which in my mind was an illegal war. The war in Iraq was certainly not sanctioned by the United Nations. There is absolutely no difference between these two wars. Because of those reasons, should we not allow war resisters to stay in Canada?</ParaText>

I found references to the legislation in an article that appeared in the <I>Toronto Daily Star</I> on May 22, 1969. It explains the decision made by the government of the day to no longer differentiate between draft dodgers and deserters seeking refuge in Canada.

              <ParaText id="1125813">There is no doubt that many cases have humanitarian and compassionate grounds within them. We have a process that allows for humanitarian and compassionate grounds applications, separate and apart from the determination as to whether a person is a refugee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125814">As for the program that she proposes in the motion, does she suggest that if people apply under the program they would not have the benefit of the application for refugee protection, as refugees? Would they not be allowed to make an application under humanitarian and compassionate grounds? I notice that the program is limited to those who do not have a criminal record. Would the member then say that the refugee protection system as we now have it on humanitarian and compassionate grounds should be reserved for those who have criminal records? That is my first question. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125815">Second, before either the refugee protection system or the humanitarian and compassionate grounds application is utilized, or the program that the member suggests is in place, would it be incumbent upon the applicant, or necessary, to have exhausted the procedural options available in the country of origin? Or does it matter whether the person has applied under the procedural options available in that country and has exhausted the process there? Would it matter whether, in the first instance, a person was drafted or volunteered?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1125817">Mr. Speaker, I would be pleased to answer this question. In the past few years, we have become accustomed to seeing the Conservative government abandon Canadians abroad, bog us down in procedures, never-ending court cases and appeals, and then avoid the major issues so as to not have to consider, debate or discuss them in this House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125818">I was a member of the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration and I have never seen such a right-wing, inflexible government with respect to the issue of immigration. We currently find ourselves in a situation where foreign policy has not been reviewed, the government is taking a controversial military direction and it refuses to put in place mechanisms to deal with exceptions. There are no options, because the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act was amended in 2001. We keep hearing the same argument—that people have to apply on compassionate or humanitarian grounds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125819">If only you knew, Mr. Speaker, how much of a catch-all this program has become. There are about 14 or 15 processes for an application on compassionate and humanitarian grounds. Some of the reasons are family reunification, denied applications for refugee status and individuals facing moratoriums. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125820">People could possibly use that program. However, there is one problem: by sending all applications to this humanitarian and compassionate program, the program lacks limits. The parliamentary secretary did not mention the rate of refusal for people who opt for this program, as well as its inefficiency.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1125828">I am a woman and a lawyer, and I tend to try to find solutions when problems arise. I listened to the parliamentary secretary to the minister ask if our way of seeing things should change depending on whether the person is a volunteer who enlisted in a country's armed forces or someone carrying out mandatory military service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125829">Should we consider the report's recommendation to set up a special program that would offer special treatment, compared to other people who come here and apply for refugee status or those who submit normal immigration applications? </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1125831">I see it as much larger than that, because a lot of the government members have really homed in on the fact that it is American war resisters who have come to Canada and who have made claims for refugee status. They are saying that for the government to somehow facilitate their staying in Canada and to regularize their legal status in Canada would confer upon them a privilege that we do not give to anyone else.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125832">Therefore, I looked at the law, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. In looking at that law, I realized that there are different sections that the government can actually use if it so wishes. </ParaText>

This decision goes against the recommendation made on December 6, 2007 by the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration. Canadians are outraged with the failure of the government to act timely enough to stop this first deportation as the Iraqi war was unsanctioned by the UN and opposed by Canada. Do you support the [committee] recommendation and do you believe that an appropriate bill should come before the House?</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="1125837">In part what I am going to say today is in fact my response. First, I support the committee report and I will vote in favour of it. Second, I also support the government actually taking action. One of the ways the government can in fact take action is to recognize resolution 1998/77 of the United Nations Human Rights Commission, which recognized that military personnel, whether volunteers or conscripts, can develop a conscientious objection. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125838">That specific resolution actually puts no limits as to whether the objection is to all war in general. We do have members of the House, and Canadians, who believe that all war is wrong. We have others who believe that there may and can be and have been just wars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125839">However, the United Nations Human Rights Commission resolution recognized that whether the objection is to all war or to a particular war, it is in fact most often in the actual experience of war that many basic human attributes, including conscience, are developed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125840"> We also know that many states clearly recognize that members of voluntary armies can and do develop conscientious objection. The reason we know it is that in their military acts or national defence acts those states actually have provisions that in some cases allow that objector to seek a discharge. However, if we look at Iraq, the United States policy does not quite align with that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125841">How can the Canadian government, the Conservative government, actually help war resisters, whether they are from the United States or from another country, to regularize their situation in Canada and provide them with legal status to remain in Canada, recognizing that individual persons can develop conscientious objection to war in general or to a particular war precisely because they have themselves now experienced it?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125842"> Under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, there is section 25. Section 25 actually states that for various humanitarian reasons, including reasons of “public policy”, a person may establish humanitarian grounds.</ParaText>

Those are victims of domestic violence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125844">There are countries and states where women, as victims of domestic violence, receive absolutely no assistance from the state or from the law enforcement within that country, in some cases because the country and state itself does not recognize domestic violence.

              <ParaText id="1125845">There were cases back in the early 1990s and the mid-1990s of women coming from, for instance, Guyana and other Caribbean countries, and from some African countries and South American countries who fled their country because they were subject to domestic violence. They had reasonable grounds to believe that their lives, health and safety was in danger and that they could not seek protection from the law enforcement there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125846">The IRB, with the initial claims, rejected them and said, no, there is a law against assault in that particular country, but the Canadian government at that time, in its wisdom, recognized that although here in Canada our law enforcement and judicial system do take the issue of domestic violence seriously, that is not the case in all countries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125847">Canada issued a public policy that if individuals were making a claim for refugee status and these individuals were able to establish that they had a well-founded belief of persecution as victims and were victims of domestic violence, and were unable to receive protection from their government, either because the government was unwilling or unable to provide that protection, that it was grounds for humanitarian acceptance of their claim.

              <ParaText id="1125852">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this debate. Let me say that this was an issue that we debated, and thought long and hard about at the citizenship and immigration committee. I remember when my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78519" Type="2">Burnaby—Douglas</Affiliation> first broached the topic that there was initially not a great deal of support. However, we talked about the issue. Afterwards, the committee came out with its report which is now before this House and is asking the House to concur in the majority report of the citizenship and immigration committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125853">Having listened to the debate, I want to touch on a few cases where this issue has a historical background when we are talking about people seeking refuge in Canada rather than engaging in combat, doing military service and going to war.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125854">The first case we had in our history was in 1793 when the First Assembly of Upper Canada passed a law exempting Quakers, Mennonites and Tunkers from military duty. This cleared the way for thousands of these people to arrive in Ontario and Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125855">In 1877 there was a large number of German Mennonites living in Russia that expressed an interest in moving to Canada to settle on the Prairies. The government passed an order in council confirming that they too could be exempted from military service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125856">In 1898-99 the government passed similar orders in council for Doukhobors and Hutterites respectively, thereby facilitating the arrival of more newcomers to the western Prairies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125857">This whole issue of offering refuge in this country relates to those who are against compulsory military service or against military service where they might have volunteered, but found out during the course of their duty that they were engaged in an illegal war and the cause that they were fighting for was not the cause that they originally joined up for and subsequently developed a conscientious objection.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125858">We do not have to go very far away to show that the issue relates to the war in Iraq and how the administration of the United States misled the American people. Yesterday, we had the reports from the former press secretary to President Bush, who made the allegation that indeed while he was the press secretary and having reflected on the matter, it was an exercise in deception in terms of getting the American public behind the war in Iraq.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125859">The fact that the president's former press secretary is now under attack by associates of the White House is not surprising. If we think back to the timeframe of the Iraq war and the debate that raged throughout the world, where the world community was pleading with the United States not to take unilateral action, that was not to happen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125860">The United States did invade Iraq with the coalition of the willing. I must say that the ranks of the coalition of the willing has shrunk a great deal. We are now talking about the United States standing virtually alone in Iraq.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1125872">First, is the program proposed in addition to, or in lieu of, the present program we have for refugee protection and application for refugee protection for humanitarian and compassionate grounds?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125873">Second, does it matter whether the applicant was drafted or volunteered for service?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125874">Third, would it be incumbent to ensure that the procedural options that are available in the country of origin are actually used before an application is made?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125875">I notice that the program they want to implement would not apply to those who might have a criminal record. For those who do have a criminal record, does the member propose that they be entitled to apply under our current refugee protection system on humanitarian and compassionate grounds, which provides for a hearing in the first instance and eventually leave to appeal to the federal court and, with leave, an actual hearing before the federal court and leave to appeal to the Supreme Court?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125876">A direct answer to any one of those questions would be appreciated, to see if we could get a less than perfect record.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1125877">Mr. Speaker, first, the government should apply a general policy that all the people who fit the motion are let in without any kind of refugee hearing to put them through the process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125878">When the current government came into office two years ago, less than 20,000 people were waiting in the backlog of refugee cases and that number was steadily dropping. Since the Conservative government came into office, those numbers are up to 45,000 and they are expected to be 62,000 by the end of the year. The refugee board system is in a crisis. As I said before, it is my belief that the government is growing the backlog in the refugee division because it wants to abolish that system. This goes with his first point. I want it as a general policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125879">On his second point, one can be drafted to go to fight in a just war. I believe many of the soldiers, just like many of the people who went to Vietnam and then became resisters, believed they were fighting in a just war. Once they got there and saw the reality on the ground, all of a sudden they did not want to do service because their conscience would not allow them to do that. There is a difference in fighting in a just war, fighting in an unjust war and fighting in an illegal war.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125880">On his third point, he asked whether people with a criminal record should be able to go through the refugee determination system. For the small number who would be left, the answer is yes, probably under humanitarian compassionate considerations as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125881">On our refugee determination system, because of action by it where it has refused to appoint IRB members, the government has created a crisis which threatens the very existence of the IRB.

              <ParaText id="1125883">We know our country has officially refused to fight in Iraq. Logic would have it then that we would support those who refuse to fight in this illegal invasion of a sovereign country. They need our support. I just met with Corey Glass who is facing deportation. I have met with other war resisters in my riding, in the town of Nelson. I have listened to their testimony in committee. I believe we have an obligation and responsibility to help these young people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125884">The argument often is that they volunteered, they chose to go. A lot of these people were deceived, and I will give a couple of examples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125885">The tenure of Mr. Glass, a native of Indiana, began in 2002 in the military when he joined the National Guard to complete “humanitarian work” within the United States, he was told. At that time, he had no idea he would end up fighting on foreign shores. When he joined the National Guard, he was told the only way he would be in combat was if there were troops occupying the United States. He signed up to defend people and do humanitarian work, such as filling sandbags if there was a hurricane. That was not what happened to Mr. Glass.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125886">I met a young couple in Nelson. The young man was told if he signed up for the military, it would pay for his university education when he got back and it would give his wife health care. She was one of the 40 million people in the United States who did not have health care. What choice did he have? He had the promise of finally getting through school with some help and being provided medical assistance for his wife.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125887"> We have to put this in context. In the past we have supported those who did not want to fight or fled the United States because of the unjust war in Vietnam. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125888">I will quote from a couple of letters. One is from Mr. Klaus Offerman of Nelson, who said that according to war resisters he talked to and according to former Iraq weapons inspector, Scott Ritter, the U.S. army used economic, educational and health care incentives to lure and pressure young, poor potential recruits into military service before they understood the reality of military life and responsibility. Meanwhile, their commander-in-chief deceived them into thinking they had a just war and they were going to search out weapons of mass destruction.</ParaText>

            <ResponseContent>
              <ParaText id="1125918">Mr. Speaker, in deciding whether to consent to the institution of proceedings under section 117 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, prosecutors apply the test set out in Chapter 15 of the Federal Prosecution Service Deskbook entitled “The Decision to Prosecute”. First, the prosecutor must consider whether the evidence is sufficient to justify the institution of proceedings. If there is a reasonable prospect of conviction, the prosecutor must then consider whether the public interest requires a prosecution to be pursued. Not all offences for which there is sufficient evidence must be prosecuted. As the deskbook states, the proper decision in many cases will be to proceed with a prosecution if there is sufficient evidence available to justify a prosecution. Generally, the more serious the offence, the more likely the public interest will require that a prosecution be pursued.      </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125919">In considering whether the public interest requires a prosecution, it is not a question of determining whether the factors listed in section 15.3.2 have been met. Rather the process is one of considering the general public interest with the factors listed, and the list is not exhaustive and the factors and their respective weight may vary from case to case, being taken into account to arrive at a general conclusion as to whether a prosecution is required. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125920">The director of public prosecutions is accountable to the Attorney General of Canada for decisions made by federal prosecutors.  Prosecutors are also accountable to the courts but the courts have indicated that they will not examine prosecutorial deliberations absent bad faith or flagrant impropriety. This is consistent with the principle of prosecutorial independence.¸</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125921">Generally, prosecutors do not publicly disclose details of their deliberations that touch upon a core element of prosecutorial discretion such as the decision to institute or stay proceedings. However, the deskbook does recognize that in certain cases, confidence in the administration of justice is strengthened by publicly communicating a general explanation for not prosecuting.  The case of Ms. Hinshaw-Thomas falls into this category. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125922">In deciding whether to prosecute Ms. Hinshaw-Thomas, the regional director followed the “Decision-to-Prosecute” policy in the deskbook. After reviewing the evidence initially presented by the investigators, he concluded that there was sufficient evidence to justify a prosecution.  He then considered whether the public interest required a prosecution. He examined the factors set out in section 15.3.2 including the general public interest in prosecuting given that a prosecution was justified on the evidence presented by the investigators, the seriousness of the alleged offence, the circumstances surrounding the alleged offence, Ms. Hinshaw-Thomas’ alleged degree of responsibility for the offence, and the prosecution's likely effect on public confidence in the administration of justice. After considering the public interest based on the evidence before him, the regional director concluded that a prosecution was warranted.   </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125923">After a charge had been laid, the investigators presented the regional director with new evidence. Consistent with his obligation to apply the evidentiary standard of “reasonable prospect of conviction” throughout the proceeding, the regional director reviewed the file in the light of this new evidence and concluded that the evidence no longer justified a prosecution. Given this conclusion, the public interest test did not enter into play.  The proceedings were therefore stayed.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1125934"> I had the opportunity to speak to many amendments that my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="79025" Type="2">Western Arctic</Affiliation>, made at the natural resources committee on Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document>. I think about 35 amendments were moved, which, unfortunately, were not passed, that would have improved the bill and made it a bill we could support. Sadly, the NDP cannot support the bill in its present form.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125935">The bill was introduced last year, sent to committee, where it was quickly shuffled through with no amendments, and now we have it before the House today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125936">The bill, in our estimation, was introduced to facilitate the development of the nuclear industry in Canada. The federal government developed the legislation to limit the amount of damages a nuclear power plant operator would have to pay out should there be an accident causing radiological contamination to property outside the plant area itself. Such legislation is deemed necessary, as private insurers refuse to compensate for damage due to a nuclear accident or incident.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125937">As I said, we had many problems with the bill but the biggest one for us was the limit on the liability. The current legislation, as we know, dates from the 1970s. It is woefully inadequate, and we agree with that, with a liability limit of only $75 million. By comparison, a new mine usually has to post an environmental bond of approximately $50 million, and it does not have radiological contamination to worry about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125938">This low level of liability is creating an impediment for foreign private industry purchasing Canadian nuclear industries. Under U.S. law, a foreign victim of an accident caused by an American headquartered company can sue for damages under American law if the foreign law is insufficient by international standards. These changes bring the legislation in line with minimum international standards, which is $650 million. We know the government brought this to the minimum international standards, the bottom of the international average.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125939">For amounts above the $650 million, a special tribunal would be set up by the <Affiliation DbId="78751" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> and further funds would come out of the public purse, which is the taxpayers' pockets. What that means is that a nuclear operator would only need to pay out the maximum of $650 million, while the public would be on the hook for the rest, possibly millions or even billions of dollars in the case of a nuclear incident or accident.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125940">My colleague and I presented amendments to the bill because we felt strongly that it was our duty as members of Parliament to look after the public good and the public interest. We do not believe taxpayers should be on the hook for billions of dollars in case of a nuclear accident.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125941">I talked about the liability framework in the United States. Canada is moving from $75 million, a woefully inadequate liability, up to $650 million. However, in the U.S. the liability can be as high as $9 billion. In other countries, such as Germany, Japan and Switzerland, they have unlimited liability. They understand that the costs of a nuclear accident outside of a nuclear facility could be devastatingly high. We know this because many of our reactors are in populated areas. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1125942">The Pickering reactors are located in a very densely populated area. Many of the businesses, homes and schools in the area are close enough that if there were a significant accident or incident, they could be negatively impacted to the tune of more than $650 million. The price of homes in that area are quite high. The future incomes of businesses in the area could be at risk if the area were to become contaiminated because people would not go into the area for years to come. All kinds of future costs could be implicated as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125943">Those are the reasons we wanted to have unlimited liability, such as those in other European countries, or to at least have a $9 billion liability, which is what it is in the U.S.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1125953">What he was referencing was that the money was not enough, obviously, and that the expansion of nuclear power was an issue. We know the <Affiliation DbId="78751" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> has told the committee that the government was looking at nuclear power as a clean energy source.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125954">I find that quite interesting because that was raised during the committee's study of the tar sands. It was one of our first studies that I was on as a member of that committee. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1125955">That made me wonder whether the government was thinking of using nuclear in the oil sands to melt the tar to produce the bitumen that we are shipping daily to the U.S., using a form of energy that has its own particular problems, such as the disposal of the waste. The issue of nuclear waste has never been resolved in this country. Therefore, to call that a green, clean source of energy is a misnomer, and yet the government likes to look at nuclear as a way out of our greenhouse gas emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125956">That is something that needs to be highlighted here because we are investing, as saw in the last budget, in nuclear. The budget had quite a lot of money for nuclear but very little for real green alternatives, such as solar power, wind power, wave generation, geothermal and all kinds of things that truly are green, clean sources of energy that have very little impact and leave a much smaller footprint on our planet. The government should be supporting more of thoses sources of energy in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125957">If the passage of the bill allows the expansion of nuclear power in this country it will be a big step backward for us in our quest to have a greener and cleaner energy source in many ways. We need to ensure that it not only does not create greenhouse gases, which it does not in that respect, but we need to look at it for all other things, such as the waste, the mining that takes place and the tragedy, human and otherwise, that it could inflict if there were to be an accident. If it is not a green source of energy we should not invest in it so heavily. We should be thinking of much cleaner, greener ways to go.</ParaText>

We believe that the figure of $650 million has no sound scientific or financial basis, and that this arbitrary amount serves to distract the Committee from a much more important question:--</QuotePara>

Again, I have to say that it is the members of this House who are responsible for ensuring public security and safety, and also accountability with the public's money. If we were to agree to the bill and it were to pass, and there was a nuclear accident and taxpayers were on the hook for any moneys over the $650 million, it would be on our heads. It would be because we allowed that to happen. We would be not just financially but morally responsible for making that decision. That would be a travesty. It is something that we ought not inflict on the Canadian public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125967">That is why for the most part we cannot support the bill. As I said earlier, the act needed to be updated. Currently, it is woefully inadequate with the amount at $75 million. We have an opportunity now to increase the liability or not to have a cap of $650 million so that the Canadian taxpayer will not be left on the hook.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125968">The amendments we proposed at committee would have brought our country in line with countries, like Germany, where there is unlimited liability on their nuclear industries. Those amendments were important because they would encourage safety in the nuclear industry. They would make the nuclear industry more accountable. The industry would then be on the hook, not the taxpayer. Why are we putting the government's finances in jeopardy?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125969">It is important to note that all Canadians want this Parliament to move toward cleaner, greener solutions for our energy needs. Unfortunately, this bill is going to pass, because it has Liberal and Conservative support, and it will increase nuclear power production around the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1125970">Instead, we could be investing much more in alternatives for our energy needs, things that would not have such an impact on the planet, things like solar power. We could help people invest in their homes to reduce their energy consumption. We do not seem to be doing much of that. There is no real program that I know of in this country that would help people invest in their own homes to reduce their energy consumption. We really need that type of program. Canadians need help with getting into things such as solar power. People need some help to make these changes to their homes, perhaps new windows and better insulation. People need help in getting rid of their old oil furnaces and converting to a greener source of energy. Ordinary families need some help with those kinds of things. </ParaText>

They have found that not much of what they are trying to invest in is covered. Heat pumps and other green sources of energy are very expensive, around $18,000.

              <ParaText id="1126007">I suggest to the member that it is important to hear not only from the principal members dealing in natural resources but from parliamentarians with regard to some of the other important issues related to legislation that has not been kept up to date.

              <ParaText id="1126009">In response to the member's question about how legislation from time to time needs to be updated, that is certainly correct. Because of that, I would underscore the fact that this needs to be dealt with promptly and expeditiously. I would also suggest that all pieces of legislation coming before this House are, I believe, quite exhaustively discussed within respective caucuses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126010"> I believe my hon. colleague from the New Democratic Party said earlier in her presentation that the position of each of the parties is well known. I believe that to be true. I believe that by continuing the debate all we would be doing is restricting the ability of this House to deal with an important piece of legislation in the expeditious manner it deserves.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1126012">Mr. Speaker, there are three reactors in different provinces. In Ontario, there is Ontario Power Generation in Bruce. In New Brunswick, there are the operators at New Brunswick Power. In Quebec, it is Hydro-Québec. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126013">This piece of legislation addresses an important issue. As I indicated in my question for the parliamentary secretary, it is a piece of legislation that has not been updated for a very substantial period of time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126014">I know there are only a few minutes remaining before question period, but I think it is important for Canadians to understand what we are debating. Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5 </Document> is an act respecting civil liability and compensation for damage in case of a nuclear incident. It establishes a specific civil liability and a regime with respect to nuclear incidents and repeals the current Nuclear Liability Act, which provides the regime today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126015">This act, which will repeal the Nuclear Liability Act, is very similar to that act. It does make operators of nuclear installations exclusively liable but, as I indicated, it increases significantly, from $75 million to $650 million, the extent of their liability and the financial security they are required to maintain. The establishment of a form of civil liability and a requirement to pay compensation in respect of damage caused by a nuclear incident is in line with the efforts to manage and minimize the risk involved in the use of nuclear material.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126016">The bill establishes a specific liability regime applicable in the case of a nuclear incident and sets out the terms and conditions in respect of the civil liability and the compensation to be paid for any damage caused in such circumstances. It also provides for the establishment of a tribunal to administer the claims arising from the nuclear incident.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126017">I was very interested in this and did a little research. The bill states specifically that it is binding on the federal government and on the provinces and it excludes two types of circumstances. The first exclusion includes incidents resulting from an act of war, hostilities, civil war or insurrection, but not a terrorist activity as defined in the Criminal Code. The second exclusion is damage to a nuclear installation or any property located at the installation and used in connection with it if the operator of the installation is responsible for the damage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126018">Earlier in the debate, there was some question with regard to the liability exclusion of suppliers of equipment that would be used in these plants. As someone who is not an expert in this area, I am not exactly sure about this and certainly would want to ask this question. In the event that there is a fault with regard to the equipment supplier, the operator itself, the purchaser of that equipment, would have legal recourse. I am not sure how far the umbrella has to go to insure all those who are directly or indirectly the source of the problem and the cause for the liability and the costs and damages to be incurred.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126019">Because of the time constraints, I am not going to be able to deliver all of my speech, but in preparing for this debate today I noted that the minister laid out the main principles of the bill. The responsibility of providing an insurance framework for the nuclear industry falls under federal jurisdiction. That is one of the reasons why we need this. It is a framework that is in existence today. Both the current legislation and Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document> apply to nuclear power plants, nuclear research reactors, fuel fabrication facilities and facilities managing nuclear fuel.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1126020">There are three principles involved that the legislation tries to emulate. Those are the principles of absolute and exclusive liability of the operator, mandatory insurance, and limitations in the time and amount. These are the kinds of things that are consistent with legislation internationally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126021">I understand that we are going to break now. Unfortunately, I will not be able to be in the House to continue my speech due to committee responsibilities, but I appreciate having at least this brief time to address the House on Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document>.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1126023">Canadians see the savings they get from the two per cent reduction in the GST almost every time they purchase something.

              <ParaText id="1126024">Corporate tax cuts are every bit as important but are less obvious. These cuts encourage businesses to keep operating in Canada or encourage new businesses to come and operate in Canada.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1126339">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document> at the third reading stage. The Bloc Québécois thinks that this bill is important to protect citizens and not to promote nuclear energy. I want to make that clear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126340">Before I begin my remarks, I would like to thank the people who worked on this bill: the researchers, the members of the committee and the witnesses, as well as all the legislative staff who helped prepare this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126341">Before I explain why we support this bill and defend the amounts in it, I would like to give an overview of the current nuclear energy situation in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126342">The <Affiliation DbId="78751" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> recently spoke to the Economic Club of Toronto about the merits of nuclear energy, including a new generation of reactors. By the way, where are those reactors? It is a secret, like all those other things the government keeps secret. Later on in his speech, he mentioned that it would take decades to find a safe disposal site. We agree with him there. It is clear that a site will not be found quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126343">Furthermore, the global partnership launched by Mr. Bush for the reprocessing of irradiated nuclear fuel, which Canada has joined, is light years away from becoming a reality. I would remind the House that, in France, this project was in the works for 15 years before it was abandoned as unworkable. By relying on all the other countries, President Bush thinks it is feasible. So far, no progress has been made on this. Everyone thinks that we will simply be left with nuclear waste to transport and dispose of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126344">This bill establishes a limit of $650 million in compensation and we think this is a fair amount. In any case, we could not put this system in place and ask for any more than the $650 million requested, because the insurance companies would never agree to it. As it is, reinsurance will be needed to make up the difference. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126345">We do not think that we could have a situation like that of the United States where full responsibility falls to the companies. With a common fund that varies between $9 billion and $11 billion, they share responsibility in the event of an accident. That is not the kind of approach we have taken here. Instead, we decided on an insurance plan that cannot exceed $650 million. We think this represents a marked improvement over previous legislation, which provided for $70 million or $75 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126346">This bill, however, has some major gaps. Of course, the government and the entire population should be able to provide all the money needed in the event of an accident. Unfortunately, the calculation of probabilities would suggest that an accident is likely to happen sooner or later, since one occurs every 30 years. Let us hope that it is not in Canada. If, however, that is the case, $650 million will not be enough. It will be the entire population that will have to pay in order to continue compensating the people affected by the disaster, the conflagration—fire is usually the result—or the radiation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126347">But the law does not provide for compensation by insurance companies in case of war or sabotage, including terrorist acts. We know that right now, terrorist activity is the greatest threat to nuclear power. That is what both Canada and the United States fear most. Since 2001, Canada's budget for protection from terrorism has quadrupled. I will review the numbers shortly. These costs are not included in the price per kilowatt hour.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="20">(1520)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1126348">These costs are not included because they are for protection, for security agencies. Those budgets do not fall within the Department of Natural Resources' purview.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126349">Information about this energy source is utterly contradictory. Our minister insists on telling us that it is clean energy. Yet it generates waste, and there is a significant accident risk. About 60 accidents happen every year in Canada. They are usually minor, but major accidents could happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126350">We are told that radiation is not a problem, even with uranium 235 mining. That is not true. As miners work, radon, a colourless, odourless gas, emanates from the mine walls. As a result, the miners are exposed to radiation. Health-wise, that is even more dangerous than asbestos. The inescapable result is cancer. Mines can be ventilated, but as we all know, it is very hard to ventilate tunnels at the very bottom of mines, where there is the most radon. It is dangerous for miners and for those transporting the ore.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126351">Since 2006, the government has had big problems with nuclear energy. I will list them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126352">In September 2007, the safety report seriously called into question nuclear safety across Canada. That is why we are now trying to change and comply with international safety standards. Because of them, it will cost much more to renovate existing plants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126353">There was the isotope crisis. The safety of the Chalk River laboratories was called into question. Then there was the firing of Ms. Keen, the president of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, who was highly qualified but annoyed and embarrassed the government. There was the disorganized crisis management on site.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126354">There was also the study on privatizing Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, an issue that still has not been resolved one way or the other. The latest problem was the failure of MAPLE. It was announced on May 16, not long ago, that the MAPLE reactors would not be brought on stream, because they could not be made functional.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126355">There is still the fragility caused by terrorism. I will come back to this, because it is true. Terrorism targets only two types of energy: nuclear energy and liquefied natural gas at liquefied natural gas terminals. Only in these two areas can terrorism really hit hard. Some people do not believe that and think that hydroelectric dams can be terrorist targets. This would be rather surprising, though. During the last war, people had a hard time destroying hydroelectric dams. Rest assured that terrorists will not attack dams.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126356">However, in the case of nuclear power, you do not need a huge plane to destroy the small buildings that protect the pools of water used to cool nuclear waste. That can be done very easily. It would also be very easy to blow these buildings to pieces by dropping a bomb on one of them. Hence, the threat of terrorism against nuclear power lurks everywhere. We need only think of the transportation of MOX. Wherever there is radioactivity, there can be terrorism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126357">Furthermore, waste management poses a problem. The minister told us that it will take decades to resolve. He just appointed a commission, the largest we have ever had: some 70 to 75 people will be involved. It will take years to identify a solution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126358">I would like to bring up another point pertaining to nuclear power. It is a source of energy and that is a provincial jurisdiction. We believe that nuclear energy must be managed by Quebec.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="25">(1525)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1126359">We accept that the safety standards may be Canadian. We are just as interested in preventing Ontario nuclear power plants from blowing up. Yet, I will reiterate that energy is a provincial jurisdiction. By the way, Hydro-Québec is doing a very good job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126360">Let us go back to the issue of waste. According to the <Affiliation DbId="78751" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation>, Canada is far from finding a location for burying the waste because no community has agreed to have a waste disposal site in its area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126361">Therefore, we support this bill but with some reservations. The bill must not promote nuclear power. Canadians are not convinced of the future of nuclear power. According to surveys, in spite of all the promotion of nuclear power and all the lobbying, the fact remains that a majority are still against it, particularly in Quebec, where citizens strongly oppose it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126362">Before we decide to promote nuclear energy, we would have to really consult the public. That includes experts, people knowledgeable about energy and the people who live next to reactors, which is important because they would be the first to be impacted by an accident.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126363">We would also need to consult with the people living along the route where the waste would be transported. We remember the 150 municipalities that were against the transportation of MOX in Quebec. The people living in the province where the waste will be buried should also be consulted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126364">All of these people need to be consulted, not just the pro-nuclear lobbyists with huge sums of money that often comes from governments. In the United States, Bush invested $18.5 billion in the promotion of nuclear energy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126365">Given that there are 22 nuclear plants in Canada, it seems reasonable to offer the public insurance that will give them a minimum amount of protection. This should not be used to build other plants, but should protect the ones that already exist.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126366">According to the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, Gentilly-2 in Quebec respects and surpasses the regulatory requirements in all of the safety categories. That is great, but it does not mean that there will never be an accident. In fact, there was one recently. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126367">The budgets allocated for nuclear safety may have quadrupled since the September 11 attacks, but authorities believe that there are still flaws in the system that could one day pose a threat to national security. That is not very reassuring.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126368">We know that security measures at Gentilly-2 have been stepped up since 2001, but Hydro-Québec has been reluctant to reveal the costs. We can imagine why, even if this corporation does a good job. Even the authorities admit that there is always a possibility of a terrorist attack at any of the existing plants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126369">I have here an excerpt from a report issued by the CNSC that shows the possibility of accidents in Canada. Earlier I was saying there are roughly 60 accidents every year. An accident occurred two months ago—and the document from the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission talks about an “accident”—involving a fueling machine removing fuel from one of the reactor channels in order to access a process tube and replace the spacer blocks. When it was being moved, the back of the fueling machine broke off and pushed the lift truck against a pillar, which shut the machine off.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126370">The fuel clusters were not affected, but they could have been. If that had happened, they would have spilled outside the cooling water, which could have caused a major accident.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="30">(1530)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1126371">It does not take much to cause an accident. A more serious accident could occur at any given time. Nuclear power is still not safe and is still dangerous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126372">That is why we want to pass Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document>, to protect these generating stations. We would not have to pass such a bill for wind energy. There is no risk of anyone being hit on the head by a rotor blade. We would not have to pass such a bill for solar energy because it is not dangerous. The worst that can happen is that a panel or a pipe breaks. With geothermal we can produce large quantities of electricity and we would not have to legislate that energy either. Why? Because there is no risk of catastrophe with geothermal plants. I toured one this winter in New Zealand. It has been there for 50 years. They have to replace a few pipes now and then, but there is no danger. The risk of catastrophe only exists with nuclear energy and natural gas terminals, as I was saying earlier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126373">Fortunately, no radiation leaked from the nuclear generating station during this accident. And the term “accident” does in fact appear in the document. I am not making it up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126374">I heard my colleague say earlier that if facilities were built underground, it would be less dangerous. That does not solve all the problems. It does not solve the problems with transporting MOX; or with mining and transporting uranium 235; or with safely disposing of spent radioactive materials; or with the use of cooling water and the possibility of leaks after an earthquake. It also does not solve the problem of potential terrorist attacks, or the risks of sabotage, even if facilities are built underground. So it does not solve all the problems. That is why a nuclear power plant, underground or above ground, is a time bomb.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126375">Earlier I spoke about the transportation of MOX. There are 150 municipalities that have spoken out against this type of transportation because they say it is very dangerous. There is currently an international movement on the quality of safety, called the Integrated Safety Review, which is a cut above what we have now. Yes, safety is a good thing, but the problem with this type of safety review is that it increases the cost of facilities by two or three times the estimated amount, especially for facilities in need of repair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126376">I will use the example of a facility I know, the Gentilly facility. The cost of renovating this facility had been estimated at $1.5 billion. Aggel and Baly, people whose job it is to assess the cost of work to be done on nuclear facilities, estimated that if the new standards were applied, the cost would rise to $2 billion, a significant increase. They also say that this price could very likely go up to $3 billion, double the original estimate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126377">However, all that is for a very limited length of time, because that is the problem. I had a graph that I would like to show the House. A nuclear facility produces electricity at peak capacity for only a brief period of time. Looking at the table, we can see that the first nuclear reactors came on line in 1970 and reached peak production in 1995. Since then, they have been declining steadily.

That is another government budget and everyone has to pay for safety. It is quite alarming, but in the meantime, we can be glad that the CNSC is being vigilant and calling for increased safety. There is a better chance of avoiding accidents with a call for increased safety and if we use the integrated system I mentioned earlier that meets the international standard.

              <ParaText id="1126403">Mr. Speaker, this is a challenging topic for the House. One of the things I have heard in this discussion about Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document>, an act respecting civil liability and compensation for damage in case of a nuclear incident, is that we should support the new limits proposed in this bill because they are better than the old ones. It seems to me that argument, in itself, is fundamentally flawed because it is like saying half a loaf is better than no loaf at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126404">We have seen other pieces of legislation proposed in the House of Commons that we subsequently had to go in and fix because they were inadequate. One of them was the voter identification piece of legislation, which disenfranchised over a million rural voters. Because the House did not perform its due diligence, we passed a piece of legislation that was deeply flawed.</ParaText>

In particular, I want to talk about the very good work that the member for <Affiliation DbId="79025" Type="2">Western Arctic</Affiliation> has done. He proposed many amendments to try to improve this piece of legislation and, unfortunately, they were not supported by members of the House.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1126408">I want to talk a bit about where this bill came from. In order to facilitate the development of the nuclear industry in Canada, the federal government has developed legislation to limit the amount of damages a nuclear plant operator would have to pay out should there be an accident causing radiological contamination to property outside the plant area itself. Such legislation is necessary as private insurers refuse to compensate for damage due to a nuclear accident or incident.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126409">The current legislation dates from the 1970s and is woefully inadequate with a liability limit of $75 million. By comparison, a new mine usually has to post an environmental bond of approximately $50 million. This low level of liability is creating an impediment for foreign, particularly American, private industry for purchasing Canadian nuclear industries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126410">Under American law, a foreign victim of an accident caused by an American headquartered company can sue for damages under American law if the foreign law is insufficient by international standards. These changes bring the legislation in line with minimum international standards. It is important to note that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126411">We look to Canada often to become a leader in any number of areas and, sadly, what we have seen over this last two years in particular is an erosion of Canada's leadership on many files, such as international human rights obligations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126412">We have certainly seen the government abandon our leadership role around the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples by refusing to sign on to it, one of only three countries left. Australia reversed its position. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1126414">Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document> limits the total liability of a nuclear operator to $650 million, which is the bottom of the international average. For amounts above that number, a special tribunal would be set up by the <Affiliation DbId="78751" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> and further funds would come out of the public purse. This basically means that a nuclear operator would only have to pay out a maximum of $650 million while the public would be on the hook for millions, possibly billions, of dollars in case of an accident.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1126420">I want to put this in the context of where this came from. The Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage tried to address some of the very serious concerns around civil liability around the world. This is a bit of background on what was happening: </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126421">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">In September 1997, the government took a significant step forward in improving the liability régime for nuclear damage. At a diplomatic conference at IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] Headquarters in Vienna, 8-12 September 1997, delegates from over 80 States adopted a Protocol to Amend the 1963 Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and also adopted a Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage.The Protocol sets the possible limits of the operator's liability at not less than 300 million Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) (roughly equivalent to 400 million US dollars). The Convention on Supplementary Compensation defines additional amounts to be provided through contributions by States Parties on the basis of installed nuclear capacity and UN rate of assessment.The Convention is an instrument to which all States may adhere regardless of whether they are parties to any existing nuclear liability conventions or have nuclear installations on their territories. The Protocol contains inter alia a better definition of nuclear damage (now also addressing the concept of environmental damage and preventive measures), extends the geographical scope of the Vienna Convention, and extends the period during which claims may be brought for loss of life and personal injury. It also provides for jurisdiction of coastal states over actions incurring nuclear damage during transport. Taken together, the two instruments should substantially enhance the global framework for compensation well beyond that foreseen by existing Conventions. Before the action in September 1997, the international liability regime was embodied primarily in two instruments, i.e. the Vienna Convention on Civil liability for Nuclear Damage of 1963 and the Paris Convention on Third Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy of 1960 linked by the Joint Protocol adopted in 1988. The Paris Convention was later built up by the 1963 Brussels Supplementary Convention. These Conventions are based on the civil law concept and share the following main principles:</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126422"> There are a number of principles outlined in these conventions, but I just want to talk about a couple of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126423">One is that the liability is channelled exclusively to the operators of the nuclear installations. Another is that the liability of the operator is absolute; for example, the operator is held liable irrespective of fault. Another is that the operator must maintain insurance of other financial security for an amount corresponding to his liability. If such security is insufficient, the installation state is obliged to make up the difference up to the limit of the operator's liability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126424">It is on this last point where we are very concerned that Canadian taxpayers may be on the hook for the difference between the $650 million and the millions and millions over and above that amount which could be incurred in a nuclear incident.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126425">We often hear Conservative members talk about being concerned about the taxpayers' purse and accountability. I would suggest they make sure to bring in legislation that actually does protect taxpayers from being on the hook for a potential incident.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126426">I want to turn for a moment to the economics of nuclear power. One of the things that is important in this consideration is the age and the state of nuclear facilities, and the kind of investment that is made for future nuclear stations, if that is the direction the government should choose to go in.

However, wishing for an outcome is not sufficient to make it fact. Until nuclear power actually meets all these criteria on a sustained basis, the additional risks of nuclear investment will be large.</QuotePara>

Utilities suffered heavy losses in the 1980s as economic regulators became increasingly unwilling to pass huge cost overruns from nuclear projects on to consumers, forcing utilities to bear the extra costs. The introduction of power markets has meant that plant owners are now fully exposed not just to the risk of cost overruns but also to plant unreliability.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="1126479">Mr. Speaker, we are debating Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document> today at third reading, which is quite an important bill in the scheme of things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126480"> The need for the bill was generated over a number of years. Suffice to say that the nuclear power option and the use of nuclear power plants for energy production began here after the second world war and was highly regulated under a statute that stayed pretty much the same for most of those years, and, as in so many other areas, an update or a modernization is required. This particular bill addresses, for the most part, the liability component of the envelope.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126481">The area is highly regulated. No matter what we do involving the nuclear industry, it is always highly regulated. Some people in Canada do not believe we should be as reliant on nuclear energy as we are. The fact is that in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick, there is substantial reliance. I think in Ontario, one-third of the current power needs are generated by nuclear energy. I am saying that to indicate that the nuclear generation option is not going away. We will continue to rely on it for many years and some of our provinces have made that decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126482">To be sure, there are other sources of energy. We are capable of improving our production of hydroelectric energy. We continue to generate electrical energy from gas. We may be using coal in some parts of Canada. Our neighbour to the south is certainly using it in some parts the country. Wind and solar options are there too but nuclear will remain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126483">Is it efficient? Is it cost effective? Is it clean? Is it safe? Is it renewable? All those questions are there and are part of the continuing debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126484">The bill does not alter any of those but it does recognize that there have been a lot of changes in Canadian society, in the world, in the financial world, in the insurance world and in our perspectives on nuclear energy and the risks associated with it that caused us to modernize the statute that governs this very regulated industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126485">If people wanted to produce some solar energy, some wind energy in a particular province, they would call it co-generation and plug it into the electricity grid, and they could probably do it without much regulation. However, if they were to try to do some nuclear generation, they could not move without a licence in their back pockets or maybe a dozen licences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126486">I should also say that Canadians, whether or not they know it, are actually quite reliant on some radioactive processes, both for health care and for some industrial processes. Radioactivity and radioactive isotopes are found in many of our communities. They are closely controlled and serve us all very well, whether we actually know it or not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126487">To be sure, there are some background radiation sources with low level radiation. They are found in various places across the country, including where uranium is mined or has been mined and where there are tailings. We generally manage those things fairly well and the Government of Canada is quite involved in that. Wherever it is higher than background level of radiation, the Government of Canada believes it has a jurisdiction and it acts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126488">The bill itself re-establishes a revised liability scheme for civil liability and compensation for this envelope of activity. It is worth pointing out that the previous statute had a maximum liability for an operator of a paltry $75 million.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="20">(1620)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1126489">These days, when it comes to potential liability for anything, whether we have some bad peanut butter, or drive a car, or a truck, or a train or fly an aircraft, $75 million is not a lot of coverage for potential liability. That has been recognized now for some time. The bill would correct that by increasing the limit up to $650 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126490">Some may say that is not a lot either. However, the bill was reviewed by the standing committee of the House of Commons and that limit was selected after looking at the basic principles of nuclear liability. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126491">I will reiterate the four principles for the record. First, the operator is the party that is liable, nobody else. Second, the operator of the nuclear facility is exclusively liable for damages if there is an accident. Third, the operator must carry insurance. Fourth, the liability is by statute limited. There are time limitations and dollar limitations, in this case running up to $650 million. This is important. Those who supply materials to the nuclear operator do not face liability for second and third party liability. They can safely deliver the commodity or service to the nuclear operator and they do not have to deal with the potential liability if there is an accident.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126492">Fortunately we have not had any serious accidents in Canada. There have been accidents in two, three or four in various places around the world. The one most people will recall is Chernobyl. The implications of that have been experienced right around the world for all these years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126493">The factors involved in picking this number include the foreseeable risk. That means the amount chosen was based on what an operator might anticipate as a risk and not from a catastrophic unforeseen event. Our nuclear reactors all have second and third backup fail-safe systems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126494">This legislation would bring Canada up to par and to the same level as most of the other countries that produce nuclear energy, certainly the western countries. We would get to the $650 million limit not in one slice, but in several years of phase-in, which would be done by regulation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126495">Under the bill, the government and Parliament will be able to review this every five years. Things may change some more in the coming years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126496">The statute takes account of what are actually huge changes in the insurance industry. The insurance will have to be obtained only through an approved insurer. The government and the House have recognized that there are other ways of insuring these days, which perhaps were not available 50 years ago. They include government guarantees, letters of credit, some types of self-insurance and the big one of reinsurance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126497">In some cases some carriers of insurance will not insure unless they have the ability to reinsure, and that means spreading out the risk to shareholders and investors in different parts of the jurisdiction or even around the world. A lot of major insurance contracts now are reinsured to spread the risk around the world. The reinsurance mechanism, which is now an industry standard, can be used here where an approved insurer will not insure without the reinsurance piece.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1126498">The insurance and civil liability also cover the movement of radioactive materials, either the uranium coming in if it is above the level and the spent uranium in the fuel rods or whatever else might be radioactive and transported. There have not been any accidents that I am aware of right now, but there can be with these things and people can be harmed, so we are insuring against those too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126499">It is notable that since the nuclear industry began, we have realized that sometimes the harm associated with an exposure to radiation will not be seen for many years. Therefore, the time limitation on a claim for bodily injury from exposure to radiation is now pushed out to 30 years. The other limitation for property damage is 10 years, but for bodily injury and death there is a 30 year limitation period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126500">In the event that a nuclear accident crossed a provincial boundary, if we did not have this legislation, we would probably have litigation going on in two separate provincial court systems. There is a provision in the bill that where there is a boundary straddling circumstance, the claim may be made in the Federal Court.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126501">The last thing I want to say about that is in the event of a major accident, the government may establish a nuclear claims tribunal, in other words, to take it out of the courts and establish a special tribunal to deal with actual liability claims and any awards that will have to be made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126502">What the government has provided for in the bill and what the House has approved is a certain amount of free market interplay with the insurance and reinsurance scheme. In theory, that should keep the insurance costs down or at least competitive and the nuclear station power operators will have the benefit of having improved accessibility to insurance and improved cost efficiencies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126503">The proposed bill also provides for a reciprocating arrangement with other countries. There is always the risk that a nuclear operator is a corporation that straddles international boundaries or the nuclear operation may be close to a boundary. For example, in my riding of Scarborough—Rouge River, the very east end of the city of Toronto, is only 10 or 20 kilometres from the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station. The generating station is on the shore of Lake Ontario and that itself is only a few kilometres from the boundary of the United States of America.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126504">There is the ability under this statute for the Government of Canada to enter into an agreement with another country to deal with the possibility of nuclear accidents and liabilities in a reciprocating agreement where it would accept our procedures and we might accept its. The ability is there and in the increasingly global environment, that is probably a good thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126505">I commend the committee that looked at the bill. I cannot assume anything about third reading, but my party certainly will support it. My hope is that we will get to third reading fairly soon.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1126508">Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak to some of the issues that my hon. colleague brought up. We were concerned with many of them. We put forward amendments, both at committee and in the House, over the time we dealt with the bill, which is a considerable length of time. One of them is the reinsurance provisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126509">The hon. member alluded to the reinsurance provisions within the bill and said that the insurance companies could reach out to other insurance companies. If they felt they could not take this risk on themselves, they could reinsure with other insurance companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126510"> However, in the bill the federal government is empowered to be the reinsurer of the nuclear facilities. If they are unable to accomplish the insurance with the insurance company, the government can step in and become the reinsurer. In other words, it can take over the liability of the insurance for the particular facility. We had a lot of trouble with this clause. We did not see this as setting up the nuclear industry as separate, distinct and on its own two feet. We saw this as the government would be brought into insuring high-risk nuclear facilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126511">How does this match up to understanding that the industry will work in an unsubsidized, unsupported manner from the government? How will this phase, which we tried to eliminate, prevent government from holding the liability for the nuclear plants that are not up to the standards that regular insurers would cover?</ParaText>

I take it he is referring to the guarantee piece for a government. My understanding of the bill is a government could become a guarantor of a insurance contract or be a surety for a reinsurance contract. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126513">The member is correct in suggesting that having the government do it is a non-market mechanism in many respects will appear to be a benefit or a subsidy to the nuclear industry. However, it is also a fact that it is highly unlikely we would have any nuclear capability in our country if it were not for a government infrastructure that regulated it in the first place. Most people will recognize that the essential component of the nuclear industry carries a lot of risk with it. It is simply not something we can carry around in our back pocket. Therefore, the presence of the government should not be a surprise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126514"> I know the bill offers the potential, with government approval, of normal insurance-reinsurance mechanisms so the risk is spread around and the costs of the insurance are kept within reason.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1126545"> The bill would replace the 1976 Nuclear Liability and Compensation Act and would establish a clear regime in the event of a nuclear accident. The bill establishes a compensation and civil liability regime to address damages resulting from radiation in the event of a radioactive release.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126546">I want to speak a little about the nuclear industry, how it relates to the bill and Canadians, and how it relates to our energy consumption and industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126547">Before I go into that, I want to speak about Canada being a world leader in uranium, uranium being the substrate utilized in our reactors. Canada, as I said during questions, is the world's leading producer of uranium. We produce 22% of the world's uranium, which is quite exciting for us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126548">What is very interesting is that the electricity generated from our Canadian uranium worldwide avoids more than 650 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually. It is really quite amazing that the utilization of uranium actually reduces that much carbon dioxide, which, as we know, is one of the greenhouse gas emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126549">Uranium is a metal and is found in abundance in certain parts of the world. We are lucky that we have it in our country. It is able to generate very large amounts of energy. We know about the possible costs of nuclear utilization. We know what happened in Chernobyl. Perhaps a little later on I will get to how that disaster happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126550">However, nuclear energy does not pollute the air and neither does it produce smog or rain. It does not produce any greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide, methane or nitrous oxide. Nuclear energy in Canada avoids the emission of about 90 million tonnes of greenhouse gases per year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126551">What does that mean in terms of cars, for example? Essentially it is equivalent of taking 18 million cars or trucks off the road. That is a staggering amount when we apply it to the real world. The amount of uranium we produce through our reactors in our country is the equivalent of taking 18 million cars off the road every single year, which is about 12% of our greenhouse gas emissions. It also reduces by 10% the amount of smog that would be produced if those cars were allowed to continue on our roads.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126552">Much is made of the factor of radiation emissions from nuclear power plants. It is very interesting that a lot of mythology surrounds it, but I think it is wise for us to put it in context. We know there is a natural supply of radiation in the world. Radon is ubiquitous in nature, and the amount of radiation that we receive from travelling in a plane, for example, is quite extraordinary. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126553">Many of us travel by plane to come to work in these hallowed halls. For those of us who travel from the west coast of Canada to Ottawa, we receive, from a one-way flight, the equivalent of 15 to 20 times the amount of radiation a person would receive if he or she lived on the perimeter of a nuclear power plant. On one trip from Vancouver to Toronto, the amount of radiation we pick up during that one flight, and not a return flight, would be 15 to 20 times the amount of radiation we would pick up if we lived on the perimeter of a nuclear power plant for a period of one year. If we were to travel once across the country one-way, it would be the equivalent of living next to a nuclear power plant for 15 to 20 years. It is quite phenomenal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126554">It is also important to know that in Canada we have quite a good nuclear safety regulation process. We have not had any substantial accidents in our country, unlike others. The big problem most of us have and are concerned about is the disposition of the spent nuclear rods.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1126555">These materials are still of danger. They are buried in the Cambrian Shield, for example, deep within the earth's core. It is done quite safely. There are concerns of course as to the transportation of those materials, but we have very good procedures in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126556">The same cannot be said for other parts of the world, and one of the challenges that I think everybody has, and that I might say is receiving short shrift in terms of the ability of our government to address it in its foreign policy perspective, is the loss of fissile material.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126557">We know, for example, that one of the objectives of terrorist groups is to acquire fissile material, not necessarily to build a bomb, but in essence to use what is called a dirty bomb where they actually take the nuclear material, pad C4 or dynamite around it and blow it up. The effect is that this nuclear material is spread in an isolated area, affecting people in the immediate vicinity of the blast zone, and also there are long term effects of being exposed to nuclear material which can be an array of cancers and other health problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126558">The challenge therefore is how we can secure that material, and I will give one anecdote. The Russians had backpack nuclear devices, small nuclear devices that were on backpacks, and when asked where these backpacks were, a key general in the Russian army, a very senior general, said, “I do not know”. Russia cannot account for the backpack nukes that they built during the cold war. That has to be very worrisome to most of us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126559">Therefore, when the government actually gets around to appointing a foreign minister on a permanent basis, one of the goals of the minister should be to work with his or her counterparts in the United States. I know for a fact that Congress is very concerned about lost nukes and lost fissile material from other parts of the world, particularly Russia and Eastern Europe where it is much easier to acquire this material and the controls on this material are more difficult.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126560">I mentioned Chernobyl. Many people like to equate the fact that because Chernobyl occurred, somehow we are going to have a Chernobyl in Canada. What happened in Chernobyl was that the actual workers in the institute were playing a game. They had turned off all the fail-safe mechanisms, turned off all the redundancies to stop an event from occurring to see how high the temperature would go within the reactor core, with catastrophic results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126561">However, that was a human failure that occurred, not a failure of the system itself. We know that we can always pervert a system if there is enough determination to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126562">The amount of waste that we have within our own reactors is relatively small and the amount is quite well controlled. The benefits, as I mentioned before, in terms of the production of energy and electricity is vast. The benefits to our environment are quite considerable and it is very important to actually be aware of this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126563">If we are going to be able to meet our greenhouse gas emission targets through Kyoto or beyond Kyoto, then nuclear power will be a part of that. What is also interesting to know is that the cost to actually manufacture power and through the life span of a nuclear reactor, the costs are equivalent to other alternative forms of energy, such as wind, solar and hydro power. That is important to be aware of because those who choose to demonize nuclear power need to be aware of this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126564">The other aspect of excellence that we have in our country is in the production of nuclear isotopes that are used in the medical field, and I think it is important for us to know that we as a country produce more than 50% of the medical isotopes in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126565">When the situation occurred not so long ago, with the minister making some grave errors at the end of last year in dealing with the nuclear isotope catastrophe that we had and the shutdown of our nuclear reactor in Chalk River, it bespoke of the fact that we lacked a redundancy in the system. As a physician, I frankly did not know that we did not have a redundancy in our system, so in that time of crisis we were trying to get isotopes from places like South Africa, which produces them too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126566">In the face of this, we had the production of the MAPLE reactor, but we have learned in the last 24 to 48 hours that the MAPLE reactor is now not going to open up.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="55">(1655)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1126567">What this means for Canadian patients and for those doctors who work in the care and in the diagnosis of patients who are ill is that we do not have the redundancy we need in acquiring the isotopes that are absolutely essential for the more than 60,000 procedures that occur every single day in the care of those who are ill in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126568">I would submit to the government that it has to come to the House and tell the House and the Canadian public what it is doing to ensure that we have redundancy in the production of radioactive isotopes in our country. If it does not do that, and if we have another problem with this 50 year old reactor at Chalk River, I might add, then Canadian patients will be left out on a limb. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126569">Few things are more frightening for patients than to have to get these tests but more frightening to them is to be let down at the last minute that they cannot have the tests because they do not have access to these nuclear materials. It is heartbreaking for the patient. It is heartbreaking for the person's caregiver.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126570">We know MDS Nordion supplies over half of the world's isotopes for the diagnostics and treatment of some very serious illnesses including numerous cancers. It is also used in the diagnosis of a number of diseases both malignancies and non-malignancies. We are also a leader in the development of gamma technology that is used for the elimination of food borne pathogens such as E. coli which can cause an array of problems. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126571">I would only submit that it behooves the government to get on this right away. The <Affiliation DbId="78751" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> must come to the House and tell the House and tell the Canadian public what he is doing to deal with this problem as quickly as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126572">On the energy security issue, I know that we will have to deal with a number of alternate forms of power including tidal power, wind power and hydro power. I want to draw to the attention of the government a really critical problem that is occurring right now in my province of British Columbia. It is going to wipe out the Similkameen Valley.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126573">The Similkameen River that runs through the Similkameen Valley comes from south of the border. The United States has an option to build a high level dam on the river. That is going to back up the water and cause the destruction of the Similkameen Valley, destroy aboriginal lands owned by them, and destroy a park that is in the middle of that territory. In effect, the flooding of this area is going to wipe out the ability of a new park to occur in southern British Columbia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126574">What we have heard from the government on this is nothing. The people of the Similkameen Valley are deeply concerned about this, yet there are options. There are in fact three options. Option one is a high level dam that will result in the destruction of the valley, the destruction of aboriginal territories, the severing of a potential national park in half, the destruction of critical habitat, and the destruction of a number of species, flora and fauna that are significant and that are endangered and specific to the valley. The second option is to build a mid-level dam. The mid-level dam can be an option because it will not result in flooding. The third option is a low level dam that would be a run of the river dam. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126575">The last two options, the mid-level dam and the small dam, are options that the government can negotiate with the United States to ensure that it has its power needs met, whereas we ensure that the integrity of the Similkameen Valley is going to continue. However, what is not an option is for the government to remain silent and not to bring this up with the U.S. government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126576">This requires the urgent attention of the Government of Canada. We have heard nothing on this whatsoever. I would like, as a British Columbia member of Parliament, to ask the government to come to the House as quickly as possible to inform the House and the Canadian public what the minister is going to do to address this particular problem. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126577">It is grave, it is critical, and it requires the minister's and the government's utmost urgency, otherwise we are going to have a very big problem in British Columbia. It will be an environmental disaster, it will be a political disaster, and it will be an economic disaster.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126578">The next issue concerns the oil sands. I know many of the members in the government come from the beautiful province of Alberta. The oil sands are in an area of some potential. They are in an area that is fraught with a lot of difficulty and could produce an environmental catastrophe.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1126579">The water issue alone is enough to make Albertans deeply concerned about this particular issue. That perhaps is why Alberta is looking toward the development of a nuclear reactor so it can get some of its energy needs from the reactor.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126580">If the tar sands continue to go the way they are going the water security of the people of Alberta will be deeply damaged. Their ability to actually engage in farming and agriculture production that they have done so ably for so long will be compromised, and the beauty and environmental integrity of what I consider one of the most beautiful parts of the world will be damaged. This does not have to happen, but what it requires is a government that is willing to get off its backside and engage the private sector that wants the government to do it, to address the challenges within the tar sands.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126581">If the government does not do that then the development of the tar sands without any consideration whatsoever for the environmental and larger economic concerns of other industries in Alberta will be a catastrophe for the people and province of Alberta as well as the people of Canada and for the world. The environmental damage that would be inflicted on the world and our country by that particular project would be so profound that it would damage the ability for us to get a hold of our greenhouse gas emissions in the future for a very long time to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126582">This is not a given but it does require leadership and it does require the government working with the private sector. I want to emphasize that the oil producers in Alberta are smart people. They know the problems that they face and they would like to work with the government to resolve those problems. The people of Alberta know that and they want this to happen, too, but what they have received from some of their elected officials and from the government is dead silence. That is not an option.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126583">Lastly, I want to address two other options. One is the issue of tidal power. Our country actually, interestingly enough, is a leader in this field. Many of the phenomenal scientists who have been involved in tidal power have actually exported their talents to other parts of the world such as Great Britain. Great Britain has overcome some of the initial scientific problems and obstructions that existed with tidal power. There were rusting problems, problems in terms of tidal movements being translated into the energy that is produced and also some security and consistency in the way that it is done. But those interestingly enough have actually been overcome, overcome I might add by Canadian scientists.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126584">Now, our job is to bring those scientists and technologies back to Canada and to utilize tidal power. My riding of <Affiliation DbId="78343" Type="2">Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca</Affiliation> is on Vancouver Island. When I am back home on the island, all I see is potential energy that is going to waste and I ask myself, would it not be remarkable if we were able to harness the energy and utilize it, particularly in coastal areas? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126585">It would be clean without any production of greenhouse gases. This could be one of the major exports that we could have, one of the things we could use within our own country to reduce our dependence on carbon-based fuels, but also it could be a phenomenal export potential for our country because many of the people of the world actually live in coastal areas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126586">One can imagine the potential that exists if we were able to capitalize and become world leaders in the area of tidal power. We are doing some of that in fact in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="78343" Type="2">Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca</Affiliation>. We have an area near Race Rocks but that kind of superb cutting edge science and research needs the attention of the federal government to ensure that we are able to maximize that potential, and utilize and export it to other countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126587">The Liberal Party will be conditionally supporting the bill as it moves forward. Our critics will keep an eagle eye on it to make sure that it meets our demands in the interests of Canadians. If it continues to be a good bill, and answers our questions and those of our citizens, then we will support it through to the end.</ParaText>

He also mentioned how this was having a devastating impact on our climate and our greenhouse gas emissions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126589">One of the things we know is that the National Energy Board recently approved two more pipelines, the Alberta Clipper and the Southern Lights pipelines, that will take raw bitumen directly to refineries in the U.S. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126590">Does the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca think that is a good idea for Canada? Once those pipelines are built they will increase production of the tar sands probably 10 or 20-fold, which will have an even more devastating impact on the climate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126591">The other thing we know is that the production there is having a serious effect on the climate and the water. We know that first nations in that area are very concerned about their health. Strange cancers are showing up in the first nations of that area and it is having a devastating impact on their communities. It is also the issue of jobs and the environment that are at risk.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1126594">As I said in my speech, the unrestrained development of the tar sands does not suit the people of Alberta, the people of Canada nor the world on a number of levels, not only from an environmental perspective, such as the release of greenhouse gas emissions, damage to water supplies, pollution of water supplies and the diminution of water supplies, but it also releases cancer causing and teratogenic materials that are having an effect on people who live in the area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126595">What we need to do is ensure that if the tar sands go forward we address those concerns. We need to look at ways to pursue carbon dioxide sequestration. We need look at ways to ensure that carcinogenic and teratogenic materials that are produced as byproducts of the industrial production of the tar sands will not be released. We also need to ensure that the health and safety concerns of not only the people who live in the region but also the workers are addressed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126596">An exciting thing about it is that we do have options. An exciting thing is that the private sector, the companies that are involved in this, want the federal government to work with them. The people of Alberta want the federal government to work with them.

I believe our role as members of Parliament is to tap into those great minds and study their ideas for the benefit of the public we serve. Extraordinary people living in our country have amazing ideas that should be brought to life, if even on a pilot project, that could benefit Canadians in many ways. I would implore the government to do a better job of utilizing our scientists. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126604">It was a sad thing when the government closed the office of the science advisor and let Dr. Carty go. Why on earth would the government close the office of the science advisor to the Prime Minister, one of the stellar scientists in our country? It is unfathomable to me but the Prime Minister chose in his wisdom to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126605">Nuclear power can be a very potent tool. It is one of an array of non-greenhouse gas emitting tools that allows us to meet our energy needs, reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, improve our environment and reduce our smog factor. It also affects the price of carbon. If we are going to be using carbon credits, the utilization of nuclear power, as with hydro, tidal and wind power, would enable us to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, acquire a lot of carbon credits and keep the price of carbon down.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1126612">Mr. Speaker, once again I rise to speak to Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document>, the nuclear liability act. It is an act that has been rattling around the House of Commons for the better part of a year and, in that year, our position has not really altered all that much on the bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126613">Yes, we recognize the need to increase the liability limits for nuclear power, very much so. We know that the liability limit that was in place before is simply not enough. However, the $650 million is a number that we have not been able to accept as a limit to the liability within the system and we have talked about that to a great degree.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126614">I will not get into that right now because it is only part of the bill. We put forward many amendments on numerous other subjects, which I will get into as I go along, but they show that this bill, in reality, limits liability in more than one way. It limits liability and continues a Canadian practice of ignoring the impacts of nuclear accidents in the country, the impacts on workers in the uranium mining industry over many years and the impacts on our soldiers when they were put in harm's way in the face of nuclear explosions in the 1950s and 1960s.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126615">There has been a consistent pattern over many years of downplaying the impacts of nuclear problems in the country. At the same time, contrary to what many of my colleagues have said, the nuclear industry is one that has never really made its way. In the half century that it has been a big part of the energy system in Canada, it has relied consistently on subsidies from government. It is an industry that has been plagued with overruns. We see this once again with the cancellation of the MAPLE reactor, a simple, small nuclear reactor going in place way over budget, to the point where we have now given up on it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126616">In the nuclear industry we have in place right now, we are looking at massive retrofits to existing plants at huge costs that are continuing to escalate as we move along. When we think of the nuclear industry, we are not thinking of an industry that has a great track record of performance in providing cheap energy for people across this country, and that is a reality. Therefore, when we talk about setting up a nuclear liability act to put things on a level playing field, we should take that seriously and we should look at how we are doing it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126617"> At the same time, we should look at our record of dealing with people who have been exposed to nuclear radiation in this country in the past and ask if we are doing enough in this bill to protect them. To that end, I will go through some of the amendments that we proposed within the bill, taking away from the liability amount and speaking to some other items.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126618">We proposed a number of amendments, such as to clause 24 which talks about alternate financial security that companies can put up in place of insurance under this bill. Up to 50% can be provided in alternative financial security. Once again, it is in the hands of the minister to deem correct the conditions by which the security is put up. Therefore, the minister has a great deal of latitude to choose what the financial security is for the nuclear plant. It does not all have to be insurance. Fifty per cent can be alternative security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126619">What is wrong with that? If there is an accident, the victims need to wait for the liquidation of the financial security in order to get compensation.

They are coming back now today with claims, long after 30 years, because it has shown up in their system. Once again, this is limiting the liability and it is limiting the ability for compensation to be paid. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126630">In any other case, it is after 10 years from the day on which the nuclear accident occurred. If it is not bodily injury, if it is contamination of a site, if it is the fact that someone uses contaminated material from a site to perhaps build another site somewhere, or to use it in the building of residences, which has been a very common occurrence right across the country, and I can point to Uranium City where that happened, the liability and the ability to be compensated for mistakes that have been made is gone after 10 years. Once again, it is the limitations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126631">Then we could go to clause 32. A person who started off suing the operator, but after a certain period of time had not seen action, would have to start all over again. People who are suffering from things which are very difficult to determine or may take years to determine, such as cancer or radiation sickness, will have great difficulty going through multiple processes to get fair compensation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126632">This clause would allow a nuclear operator to delay having to pay compensation by throwing legal roadblocks in place. Wait long enough and working Canadians will suffer and compensation for the people who look for it will be unavailable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126633"> Once again, the bill creates a situation where the claimants are at a greater risk than the company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126634">Clause 34 states that the maximum amount paid may not exceed 20% of the difference between the totals set out and total amounts paid by the operators. Therefore, interim compensation for people who are previously ill can only amount perhaps to 20% of what they require to cover their compensated loss. Once again, this speaks to favouring the company over the people who may be involved in the claims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126635">We also had a lot of trouble with clause 47. The tribunal, which has been set up to review these things, may refuse to hear any claim referred to it if it considers them to be frivolous or vexatious. This is patently unfair under the rules of our courts. Federal courts can only reject an action if a person has persistently instituted vexatious proceedings or has conducted a proceeding in a vexatious manner and only with the consent of the Attorney General of Canada. A tribunal will simply be able to say to a victim looking for compensation that the claim is vexatious, that it does not have deal with it. Where is this serving Canadians when it comes to establishing compensation?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1126652">Mr. Speaker, I would like to pick up on Bill <Document DbId="3073285" Type="4">C-377, An Act to ensure Canada assumes its responsibilities in preventing dangerous climate change</Document>. It is bill brought forward by the leader of the NDP, as a private member's bill. I congratulate the leader for his work and thank him for his continuing contribution to the debate about carbon pricing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126653">I especially want to thank him for keeping an open mind. I know he came out strongly against the notion of a carbon tax shift at first, but yesterday he came some way back in recognizing that a carbon tax shift would be considered an invaluable tool as we took on the challenge of bringing greenhouse gas emissions back down our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126654">Why is a bill like this even necessary? We looked at some questions just last night in the committee of the whole that were directly related to this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126655"> I asked the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> directly, as did my colleague, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78902" Type="2">Mississauga—Erindale</Affiliation>, about the effects of energy prices on the forthcoming government cap and trade plan, its regulatory plan due for October. The minister appeared confused by the question, as he did for that matter for much of the evening. He could not give us an indication that he even knew he had a cap and trade plan. He did not know it would cost Canadians more at the pumps, more for natural gas, more for home heating and more every time they made a purchase, but this is indisputable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126656">Let me quote directly from the government's “Turning the Corner” plan. At page 14 of the so-called detailed report of the government, which let me assure Canadians is no detail, it says, “Our modelling suggests that Canadians can expect to bear real costs” under the government's plan. It goes on to say, “these costs will be most evident in the form of higher energy prices, particularly with respect to electricity and natural gas”. I am not saying that. That is the <Affiliation DbId="105835" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and the government in their plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126657">Here is the real irony. Today we had the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in London flogging his plan in Europe. Last night the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> could not even answer basic questions about the design of the cap and trade system, for which he is responsible, about the economic analysis that underpins the price of carbon, for which he is responsible. Yet the Prime Minister is out vaunting to the world, in Europe, in London, Rome and Paris, that he has a plan that will take Canada so far in the future. It is quite remarkable. The minister could not even tell us the price of carbon today, much less what he anticipates it to be in the fall.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126658">How can we have 2008-09 budget estimates and projections if the minister does not know what the price of carbon will be and what the distributive effects will be on energy prices in the Canadian economy? The minister could not answer that question. He was not asked once, not twice but four times by two separate members of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126659">We have the minister so busy pursuing the politics of fear, racing down around carbon pricing, that he has not bothered to do even his own homework about the plan for which he is responsible for delivering in six short months from now. He even had more difficulty explaining his ecotrust scheme. This is really rich. It is $1.5 billion put into a trust with no strings, no conditions, no verification and no accountability at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126660">When we were in government, there was the partnership fund. Under ecotrust, there is no agreement with the provinces. There is no verification. I asked if he could tell how he expected the $1.5 billion to reduce a single tonne of greenhouse gases. Not only was he flustered, he did not even know what I was talking about. He is administering the $1.5 billion fund, not his colleague, the <Affiliation DbId="105835" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation>. It is really unbelievable that we are trying to reconcile all of this and the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> simply does not know what he is doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126661">Let us turn back to the provisions of Bill <Document DbId="3073285" Type="4">C-377</Document> and the amendments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126662"> Motion No. 1 is simple. It identifies the GHGs we are talking about, as listed in the list of toxins under CEPA. Listing these greenhouse gases was a Liberal government achievement in the last Parliament. Other amendments deal with the roles of the round table on the environment economy and the Commissioner for the Environment and Sustainable Development.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1126663">I continue to manifest grave concern about the government's unilateral decision to change the reporting structure of the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy out of the Privy Council Office and the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s office and seriously weakening its reach and impact by putting it under the <Affiliation DbId="105835" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation>, particularly the current Minister of the Environment, but certainly the Department of the Environment.</ParaText>

How did the Conservatives do this? They did it by subterfuge. They did it with the stroke of a pen. They cut the legs out from underneath the agency. The government does not even understand what Brian Mulroney understood when he set up the agency to report directly to his office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126665">It is about PMO control. It speaks volumes about the fact that the Conservatives really want to control the Ministry of the Environment. They want to weaken what happens with civil society actors who come together in a place like the national round table. What really happens is that the advice gets buried and marginalized.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126666">It is very interesting, because last night we also asked the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> to explain to us just what is happening with the cap and trade system that he is talking about and how, for example, it might connect with other trading systems. Wow. That was really quite remarkable, because the government has no idea how its own cap and trade system will affect energy prices. It has prepared nothing in this fiscal year for the distributive economic effects, increases in costs for home heating fuel, natural gas, oil, and increases in gas prices at the pump. Let the Conservatives stand and deny it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126667">On the one hand the <Affiliation DbId="105835" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation> says, “We are in favour of pricing carbon”. On the other hand the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> says, “I do not know what you are talking about. I cannot even tell you what the price of carbon will be. I have no idea what the price of carbon is today in the marketplace”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126668"> It is unbelievable that we are four months away from the Conservatives' so-called cap and trade plan, but it is worse again, because they do not know how it will connect with the emerging provincial regimes. Whether they are carbon taxes in B.C. or whether they are trading systems in Quebec, they do not know. This is worse, because they do not even know how their national cap and trade program will connect to the international cap and trade program coming from Europe and elsewhere for those countries that were still signatories to Kyoto, Canada having abandoned it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126669">Yet again, there is no evidence from the government that it knows what it is doing on cap and trade when it comes to an emerging potential American system under a president McCain, or a president Obama, or a president Clinton.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126670"> It is really quite remarkable that the Conservatives do not know what they are doing; the left hand, the right hand. The irony cannot be lost on Canadians as the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is over in London giving a grandiose speech about his climate change vision for Canada, and the plan, which nine independent groups in Canada, including such left leaning institutions as the C. D. Howe Institute, Deutsche Bank, CIBC World Markets and others have looked at and said, “It is not believable. There is no analysis. They will never achieve the greenhouse gas cuts they claim they will achieve”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126671">How can they, when the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> does not even know what the price of carbon will be in four months when he is going to set up the economics of a trading regime for this country? It is unbelievable for Canadians when they see that kind of incompetence, in fact, negligence. The minister was scrambling, looking for documents, turning to the deputy minister and the ADMs, who apparently knew even less. Yet we are four months away from the government claiming it is announcing a major regulatory system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126672">Worse, the politics of fear compels the government to try to deliberately mislead Canadians about the fact that when it brings out its plan, it will have a massive impact on energy costs: “Do not tell the people this. No, do not tip your hat. We are the tax fighters”, the Conservatives say, “We are the tax cutters”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126673">There is no surprise there again, because we now have in government the arrival of the Harris quintuplets: the prospective chief of staff to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="78772" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="105835" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation>, and now the<Affiliation DbId="105838" Type="96"> House leader</Affiliation>; the five man wrecking crew who just about ruined the province of Ontario, leaving it with a $28 billion increase in provincial debt and a $5.6 billion deficit.</ParaText>

As you know, my party, the Bloc Québécois, has been one of the strongest proponents of the Kyoto protocol since it was signed in 1997. It is the only party that has consistently called on the federal government to come up with a plan that meets the climate change targets.</ParaText>

However, I wanted to take part in this debate, because environmental problems are not always visible in our everyday lives, even though they have serious consequences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126677">The specific consequences of global warming are becoming increasingly tangible, and we must take urgent action before we reach the point of no return. Every day brings more information about the serious long-term risks and the implications for future generations.

              <ParaText id="1126678">The long-term implications are so obvious that paragraph 5(<I>a</I>) of the bill sets out a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to a level 80% below the 1990 level. This reduction of greenhouse gas emissions generated by human activity in Quebec and Canada would have to be made by 2050.

The government, which in recent years has unfortunately abandoned its role as an environmental leader, will be able to restore its image.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126680">This bill also proposes that a report be made to the House of Commons on progress in the fight against climate change. Bill <Document DbId="3073285" Type="4">C-377</Document> provides for five-year interim plans and annual reports. These requirements, set out in clauses 6 and 10, create accountability for targets and results. Moreover, they provide a way of clearly informing the public about developments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126681">That is the way to make a serious plan for public policy implementation. Neither the previous government nor the current one had these elements in place to bring in concrete actions in response to the commitments made.

              <ParaText id="1126686">Here is an example that speaks volumes: my region, Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean, is a major aluminum producer. Aluminum is a primary metal, and the industry is an economic engine that has undergone restructuring several times in the past 20 years. Companies have invested a lot in research and development. They doubled their aluminum production between 1990 and 2005: 1.3 million tonnes in 1990 and twice that in 2005. One might think that emissions doubled as well. But they did not. In fact, greenhouse gas emissions dropped by 500,000 tonnes. As a result, in 2006, emissions were 15% lower.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126687">Aluminum producers in Quebec did not stop there. In June 2007, together with the Government of Quebec, they committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by an additional 150,000 tonnes between 2008 and 2011.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1126699">Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="3073285" Type="4">C-377</Document>, a bill that would help Canada and would make Canada assume its responsibilities in preventing dangerous climate change gas emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126700">Over the last day and a half, I had the opportunity to travel to Greenland on the issue of northern sovereignty. While I was there with the <Affiliation DbId="78751" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation>, I had the opportunity to travel to the Greenland ice cap, which is an amazing place. It is a huge expanse of ice that has been in place for hundreds of thousands of years. There is an enormous volume of moisture tied up in the ice cap, but it is quite clearly under severe strain right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126701"> The scientists we met with on the ice cap talked to us about the conditions they are seeing within this massive and seemingly eternal landscape of ice that is thousands of metres thick and is covering a whole continent. However, right now it is moving. The movement within the ice is accelerating. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126702">The rate of loss of the ice cap is accelerating as well. It accelerated over the past decade to a point where it had between 250 and 300 cubic kilometres of ice loss each year. Last season, it achieved 500 cubic kilometres of ice loss. That is a massive increase.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126703">Any discussion of northern sovereignty, of course, links to climate change. We had the opportunity to hear presentations on climate change from very respected climatologists in large research institutions. They said that the situation right now with the Arctic ice is likely to mean that if we have another warm summer this year, they will be able to sail a boat across the North Pole, from Norway through to Russia. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126704">That is an extraordinary statement. It may not come to pass. We may have a cooler summer. However, the direction that our climate is taking is extremely disturbing. We must recognize that. As Canadians, we have a tremendous responsibility to lead ourselves and the rest of the world toward solutions, toward mitigation as well as reducing our impact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126705">This bill sets out the kinds of goals that are required to achieve what the scientists have said is a sufficient reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for the world by 2050. Setting out the goals for Canada to achieve those things is extremely important. It is part of what we have to do here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126706">I am dedicated to this. I will dedicate the rest of my life to working to achieve the kinds of things we have to do in Canada to preserve our life and the chance for our children and grandchildren to continue to prosper. That is certainly a worthwhile goal and I have total faith that this country can do that. It can move ahead in a fashion that can achieve our goals in this way. I do not see why we cannot.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126707">I had an opportunity to talk to the Danes. I like the Danes. The Danish minister of energy said to me last year that if we want to accomplish something on climate change and energy, we need to build a non-political consensus within our Parliament of the directions we have to take. That is so important. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1126708">The relentless sniping over climate change that we have seen in this last two years really does not accomplish all that much. However, we did accomplish one thing on climate change already. When we sent the clean air act to a special committee, we got a majority in Parliament to agree on the directions we should take to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We got a majority in Parliament to agree to the mechanisms that we should use to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126709">What I heard from the members of the other party who did not quite agree with us at the time is that they were pretty well on side with most of those mechanisms anyhow. We said in the clean air act that we wanted to put a cap on emissions, put a price on carbon, and create a massive retrofit program for this country so the first step we would take would be to reduce people's use of energy. We would see rapid and substantial decreases in greenhouse gas emissions. We would have a mechanism to fund this and these things would come to pass.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126710">We did that work. The bill is sitting there, waiting to come back to Parliament, waiting to spring into life and to provide that direction to this country. We have done that work and we need to see that kind of plan in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126711">Sometimes we find that other parties change in regard to that. They start to talk about other ideas like they are picking fruit from a tree. Here is a different fruit, they say, let us try that one. What really is required is a consensus on action. We worked on that for a long time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126712"> I would say to the Liberal Party members that they should remember what they worked on in this Parliament. They should remember the effort they put into this, the good ideas they put forward and that we supported, and the good ideas that they have accepted from us. When they move forward with anything on this issue, they should remember that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126713"> We need consensus and we need to build from consensus in the government and in this country to accomplish these rather difficult paths that we have ahead of us. However, if we accomplish them, we will do a major and wonderful thing for the world, for our own society and for our children and grandchildren.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126714"> Bill <Document DbId="3073285" Type="4">C-377</Document> is setting out the goals. It is giving us a framework with which to analyze the goals and make sure that we are on track. It is a planning document of the first order. It is an opportunity to layer in the mechanisms, to understand how they work and to ensure they are meeting the targets as we move along.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126715">Why would we not have a process like this, a process that will take the politics out of it and will mean that we can move ahead very carefully?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126716">I appreciate your gesture, Mr. Speaker. As always in the House, the work that the Speakers do to keep us on track is great. I also appreciate the fact, Mr. Speaker, that you shared that green chair with one of my colleagues, who I am sure will always relish the memory of that opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126717">To get back to the subject at hand, how can we continue to work on this together? We can continue by passing this legislation. The bill is a planning document. It allows us all to agree on the process that we will follow. It is a document that gives us the flexibility to look at how we are making decisions and to ensure that those decisions are moving us in the right direction. By its nature, it is a non-partisan document. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126718">If we all support this, we can move ahead. We can make a difference in this country. We can make this Parliament sing a different tune. We can say, “Here is the reality of what we are dealing with in this world and in this country, so let us make it work together”. Let us make a better place for all of us. Let us put aside the politics on this particular issue for a second, a day, a week, a month, a year, and let us move ahead with this for the good of Canadians.</ParaText>

It is actually a very poorly written bill and is the first bill I have seen in years that did not make it through committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126721">During the report stage of Bill <Document DbId="3073285" Type="4">C-377</Document>, we were reminded of the 13 long, dark years of Liberal neglect on the environment, a time when emissions continued to rise every year and the Liberals did absolutely nothing on the environment.

              <ParaText id="1126723">The previous Liberal government, with much fanfare, committed Canada to a formal target under the Kyoto protocol, but as we later discovered through comments from the former Liberal environment ministers and a senior Liberal adviser, the previous Liberal government had no plan and no intention of ever achieving the ambitious targets set out by the Kyoto protocol agreement. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1126727">Our government believes in being honest with Canadians as well as our international partners. That is why we introduced the “Turning the Corner” plan, an environmental action plan that not only is realistic and achievable but will maintain Canada's economic competitiveness. We need greenhouse gas targets that are technically achievable and at an acceptable cost. That is what is found in the government's turning the corner action plan. Unlike Bill <Document DbId="3073285" Type="4">C-377</Document>, which was not costed, our plan was costed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126728">Before setting any targets, we need to know the economic impacts. As I mentioned, Bill <Document DbId="3073285" Type="4">C-377</Document> has not been costed by the NDP despite repeated calls for that analysis to be undertaken. What is the NDP trying to hide from Canadians?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126729"> Does the NDP not believe that Canadians have the right to know what the bill, if adopted, would mean to the Canadian economy? Do Canadians not have the right to know what sectors of the economy will be impacted by the legislation and how badly they will be impacted?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126730"> Does the NDP not believe that Canadians have the right to know whose jobs will be lost as a result of the bill? Yes, Canadians do have that right. Do Canadians not have a right to know the price of gasoline if Bill <Document DbId="3073285" Type="4">C-377</Document> were to go forward? As we have heard, we are looking at another $1.50 a litre on top of what Canadians are paying now.</ParaText>

When we include that with what the Liberals are proposing with their carbon tax, we can imagine what would happen to the cost of energy in Canada. I would like to contrast the NDP plan and its approach with that taken by the government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1126736">Any discussion about Bill <Document DbId="3073285" Type="4">C-377</Document> has to be taken in relation to the so-called plan issued yesterday on carbon pricing by the leader of the NDP. Actually, it was nothing more than another one of those empty NDP media events.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1126738">Instead of talking about putting a price on carbon, our government has already shown leadership on the environment and delivered a balanced solution to tackle climate change with our “Turning the Corner” environmental plan, which includes, for the first time in Canadian history, a price on carbon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126739">As members know, our “Turning the Corner” plan to cut Canada's greenhouse gas emissions by an absolute 20% by 2020 will see the market set a price on carbon starting at around $25 a tonne and rising to $65 a tonne. That plan can be seen online. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126740">In addition, our government's plan has brought certainty to the carbon market, and that is important. The Montreal Exchange has said that our March “Turning the Corner” announcement has given it the green light to start trading as early as tomorrow, May 30. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126741">The NDP leader actually bragged yesterday that the NDP raised the issue of climate change back in 1983, yet greenhouse gas emissions have skyrocketed since then. I guess he has actually been celebrating 25 years of NDP failure on the environment. The fact is if we look at the track record of the NDP, it has been an absolute failure on the environment. Those members have done absolutely nothing. Ultimately, that is the problem with the NDP. Those members can talk all they want, but the fact is they have never actually done anything to protect the environment.</ParaText>

The Prime Minister is demonstrating that Canada is taking real action in the fight against climate change, both here at home and abroad.

That is the kind of leadership that Canadians can count on with this government to deliver every day.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1126750">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill <Document DbId="3073285" Type="4">C-377</Document>, which ensures that Canada assumes its responsibilities in preventing climate change. This bill is even more important because it does not put a partisan spin on this issue, an issue that is probably the greatest challenge of the 21st century. Canadians expect us to be above partisan games. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126751">Mr. Speaker, I want to say that I was very honoured that you asked me to replace you for a few minutes. I had the opportunity, while sitting in the green chair, to look at things from a different perspective. I spent a few minutes thinking about how important it would be for the government to show true leadership on this issue that is so important for the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126752">I recently attended a conference in Victoria.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1126753">The conference, called “Gaining Ground”, was held in Victoria during the break week. There were people gathered from all over<?bk?> B.C.<?ek?> and indeed from all over Canada and even from the United States. There were students, scientists, economists, and business people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126754">The students, the young people, said, “Do not mortgage our future”. The economists were saying, “Do not treat environmental impacts as externalities, as we have been doing and as we continue to do”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126755">Business leaders are far ahead of where we are at the moment. There were builders there who talked about the incredible impact that we could have by simply having some leadership at the level of changing the rules around construction in Canada and beginning to build green buildings, green homes, the kinds of green economy jobs that we could be creating, but that has not happened yet. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126756">This bill would allow us to work together to build consensus. This bill is really science-based and I would like to go back to that. However, I want to talk a little about the consensus that I think the New Democrats have tried to build on during this Parliament, given how strongly we feel about this issue and how important we believe it is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126757">There was the Liberal Bill <Document DbId="2181701" Type="4">C-288</Document>, the Kyoto bill, and we agreed to work with the Liberals to bring that bill through committee to the House and to pass it. It was the same thing with Bill <Document DbId="3134198" Type="3">C-30</Document>, the Conservatives' climate change bill, which in its initial stages would have done very little to mitigate climate changes, but we proposed that all parties bring their best ideas and work together in consensus at committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126758">We did that and there were some great ideas that came from all parties and this bill remains at third reading. The government has refused to bring it to the House for a vote and that simply goes against what Canadians expect of us. They want real change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126759">As everyone tries to understand the shifts that are required to achieve a more sustainable future, they are discouraged by the lack of action by successive governments. We know that biophysical and social changes can reach a tipping point, beyond which there is potentially irreparable change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126760">My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="79025" Type="2">Western Arctic</Affiliation> spoke about his visit recently to Greenland and observed with scientists the way glaciers are receding. I had the fortunate experience to do the same thing on the other coast. I had the opportunity to visit Prince William Sound and the glacier called Nellie Juan. The people who were with us, who had been living in that area for some 30 years, showed us the way the ice was receding. There were beginnings of growth of vegetation where the ice had stood for centuries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126761">That is our children's future and our grandchildren's future that we are looking at. This is why I take this issue so seriously, as I think do all Canadians. The reason this bill is so exciting is it sets firmly into law the responsibility Canada must assume to prevent the tipping point that I mentioned.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1126762">Setting targets into law is key. Before I ran for election I remember having a conversation with the former minister of the environment. He was discouraged by the lack of action and the lack of commitment of his own government to move forward on climate change after accepting the Kyoto agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126763"> I got the impression that the reason he felt there was a lack of commitment was that the discussions always occurred behind closed does in cabinet and there was no formal legislation requiring government to take action. It was always discussions behind closed doors and power plays that prevented any real decisions to take action. This piece of legislation would change that process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126764">Scientists tell us there is a consensus that an increase of 2° in the world's surface temperature from pre-industrial levels would constitute dangerous climate change and trigger global scale impacts and feedback loops from which it is difficult to imagine coming back.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1126773">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to add to the debate on Bill <Document DbId="3073285" Type="4">C-377</Document> at report stage .</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126774">The Conservative Party members on the environment committee, which studied the bill, have some serious concerns about the legality and constitutional status of this bill. I know that the Conservative members were, and are, extremely concerned regarding the lack of any economic analysis or costing of the bill, its constitutional validity and the manner in which the bill was reported back to the House. Bill <Document DbId="3073285" Type="4">C-377</Document> is an irresponsible piece of legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126775">What the NDP is proposing would require a 40% reduction in greenhouse emissions from where we are today. Much like the Liberals' hidden carbon tax plan, this simply is not possible without causing massive job losses and huge price increases in electricity, heat and gasoline. The costs that this bill would impose on Canadian families and businesses could be quite considerable. Yet, when he testified at the committee about the bill, the <Affiliation DbId="78385" Type="2">leader of the NDP</Affiliation> actually admitted that he had not bothered to find out how much the bill would cost Canadian families in increased gas and energy prices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126776">One would think for a member who stands in this House almost every day and rails on and on about gas prices, he would have taken the time to step back and get a fair costing of what he was proposing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126777">Costs alone should not be the only reason to defeat this bill. Earlier, I believe that one of my colleagues addressed comments made by the respected constitutional scholar Peter Hogg at the environment committee in early February. I know he made reference to his comments that this bill would likely be struck down by the Supreme Court. What he did not mention was another comment made by Mr. Hogg. He said, “the constitutional issues are all that I am concerned with, and they are, in my view, enough to defeat the legislation”. Wise words from a wise man. I believe that Mr. Hogg's comments should be heeded by all members of this House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126778"> Unfortunately, all the NDP members care about is passing feel good pieces of legislation that will not accomplish what they want them to accomplish.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126779">It is not just the cost and the constitutionality of the bill that are in question, but it is also the issue of regulatory targets. I think we all agree in this House that regulatory targets like those being proposed in Bill <Document DbId="3073285" Type="4">C-377</Document> should be evaluated carefully and logically. For example, we all know that the previous Liberal government set arbitrary targets on greenhouse gas emissions at Kyoto under pressure from former Liberal Prime Minister Jean Chrétien and then stood back and did nothing for 10 long years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126780">That brings me to a comment made by a witness at the environment committee earlier this spring.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126781"> Andre Turmel from the Canadian Bar Association appeared as a witness. One of the things that he said which I found most interesting is that targets “should be linked to and coherent with targets set out in existing international law.... The targets in Bill C-377 are not”. That is a very interesting comment. The targets in Bill <Document DbId="3073285" Type="4">C-377</Document> are incoherent with those set out in international law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126782">Either the NDP research bureau did not bother doing any homework or the<Affiliation DbId="78385" Type="2"> NDP leader</Affiliation> is more interested in scoring political points than fighting climate change. In either case, this is not responsible behaviour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126783">In conclusion, the question that this House is facing today with this bill is: Should we set climate change objectives that we know from the very beginning make little or no sense; objectives that would be impossible to meet without considerably disrupting the Canadian economy? Or should we set realistic and achievable targets that would strengthen Canada's long term competitiveness; targets that would still represent significant and positive progress in the fight to reduce harmful air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126784">I know that the Conservative members agree with the latter position. That is why we cannot support this bill. Quite frankly, this bill is comparable to a foot on the throat of the automotive industry. Thousands of jobs in my area, in the area surrounding the Durham region, Northumberland and Peterborough, are reliant upon a healthy and vibrant automotive industry, yet we have seen some job losses. We have seen two shifts laid off at the General Motors truck plant.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="25">(1825)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1126785">This legislation will just add to the problems of the automotive industry, an automotive industry that the NDP claims to support and yet at that committee, I am told that the automotive industry said that this will be tantamount to almost obliterating automotive plants and parts assembly plants across the province and the country. That is unacceptable. That is why we will not support the bill.</ParaText>

This is a bill that we fought tooth and nail at committee, every step of the way because it is a bad bill for Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126789">It is a very bad bill. We already heard from previous members of our party about how it was not costed. What are the costs? We had a chance to probe that at committee, to ask witnesses. We asked an economist what the cost of it would be. Even in his spotty analysis he predicted there would be dire consequences for certain sectors, among them the auto industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126790">What was the proposed solution from the New Democrats? Billions of dollars for some sort of transition fund to create a job, hopefully somewhere down the road. However, they were prepared to put the auto industry out of business right now, moves that Buzz Hargrove himself even said would be suicidal for the economy. It would mean that every car in Canada, except the Impala, could not be produced here. What does that mean for communities like Oshawa, Windsor, Oakville and on and on down the list? That means they are out of jobs; the industry is done here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126791">The reality is that the NDP members do not care. They can stand in the House and say that they are there for the working family, but they are prepared to put a bill forward that even the economists say is going to pose a real problem for jobs that exist today. There is no plan for the future.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1126795">What else do the NDP members want to do in the post-Kyoto period? They want to give China a 20 year pass on emissions so that manufacturers there can manufacture a car cheaper than can our own domestic industries. That is what they want to do.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1126842">Mr. Speaker, on April 4, I asked the <Affiliation DbId="105835" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation> about his appearance before the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates. The Minister of the Environment sidestepped the questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126843">I will review the facts. In the fall of 2006, a municipal election was held in Ottawa. The stakes were very high, in particular the light rail project. Members will remember that the municipal council negotiated and approved a contract with Siemens to carry out the project. The council then made a request for $200 million in funding from the Government of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126844">At the time, the current <Affiliation DbId="105835" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation> was President of the Treasury Board. It was public knowledge that the President of the Treasury Board did not get along with the then-mayor of Ottawa, Bob Chiarelli. However, a mayoral candidate, the current mayor of Ottawa, Larry O'Brien, seemed to hit it off with the Conservative minister. The two allegedly conspired to offer a job to a third candidate to remove him from the mayoral race.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126845">It could not be more clear: by interfering with the subsidy for the light rail project, the President of the Treasury Board was interfering in the mayoral race. What did he do? He got a copy of the contract and found a weakness. He said he had hit the jackpot. He attacked the reputation of several municipal officials, claiming that these City of Ottawa officials had lied to him. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1126846">In his eyes, the light rail project was a fiasco. Why then did federal officials approve the project? Why was the Department of Transport, with its expertise, not called in to advise the Treasury Board president? Why did he not consult his own officials, who had already approved the project? There were many projects on the drawing board, but the light rail project was the only one to get the president's personal attention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126847">After the election, the new Ottawa municipal council decided to cancel the light rail project. Because of the minister's stubbornness and poor judgment, the City of Ottawa is still waiting for light rail and could be forced to pay hundreds of millions of dollars for breach of contract.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126848">During his testimony at the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates, the <Affiliation DbId="105835" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation> stated that the Treasury Board had met on October 10, 2006, in the cabinet room to approve his light rail decision. But that was a break week. Government files and media reports confirmed that members of the Treasury Board were not in the city on that day. Instead of clarifying the situation, the <Affiliation DbId="105836" Type="4">Leader of the Government in the House of Commons</Affiliation> accused the media of reporting false information. Instead of simply telling the truth or correcting the facts, the minister blamed the media.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126849"> The government has had almost two months to respond clearly and act transparently on this issue. I would like to repeat my question from April 4: on what date was this meeting held and which cabinet members were present?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1126850">Mr. Speaker, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78429" Type="2">Hull—Aylmer</Affiliation> has actually managed something quite incredible. In such a short amount of time he has put out so much false information it is very difficult to actually respond.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126851">First but not least of which is the fact that he just cited a meeting of the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates and what was said there and what happened there. The member was not even there. He is not a member of the committee. He does not know what happened in the committee. He was not there for the testimony. He was not there for the questioning. He was not there for any of the information that he is now splicing and dicing, and trying to put forward as some kind of an explanation for something that in fact did not at all happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126852">This is not unusual. It is not original. We know that the Liberals have been putting forward, led by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78329" Type="2">Ajax—Pickering</Affiliation>, a bunch of falsehoods on this file. The other day the member for Ajax--Pickering, in fact, said:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1126855">The fact of the matter is, and this is the central fact that I would ask my hon. colleague from Hull to understand. The central fact is that Treasury Board, under the current <Affiliation DbId="105835" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation>, the member for Ottawa West--Nepean, approved funding for the light rail project, but it was the democratically elected Ottawa City Council that voted against the light rail contract. Treasury Board approved the money and it was the city council, elected by the people of Ottawa, that voted against the light rail contract.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126856">As for the contract the member opposite knows that it was five former Liberal party candidates who voted against the previous light rail project at the Ottawa City Council.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126857">I want to return for a second to the member for <Affiliation DbId="78329" Type="2">Ajax—Pickering</Affiliation> who has led the charge on this issue. He filed a frivolous complaint on this subject with the Ontario Civilian Commission on Police Services. What did it do? It threw his complaint out completely. It threw it out. It was so frivolous that it would not even listen to him. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126858">As a matter of fact, OPP Commissioner Julian Fantino was interviewed on CFRA radio about this very same issue earlier this week. He confirmed that the Ontario Civilian Commission on Police Services had completely dismissed baseless complaints from the Liberal member for <Affiliation DbId="78329" Type="2">Ajax—Pickering</Affiliation>. He also said that it was interesting that the member for Ajax--Pickering was making these complaints because that very own member's office was calling up the OPP on several occasions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126859">It gets better. Commissioner Julian Fantino said what he thought of these Liberal claims. He called them “ludicrous, frivolous, vexatious” and an “attempt to interfere with due process”. He also said the following about the accusations by that Liberal member. He said, “I don't know how anybody other than those of feeble mind could ever jump to these conclusions. Absolutely it's preposterous”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126860">The only thing left to do on this subject, other than leave it behind as a non-scandal, another one of these Liberal non-scandals where they throw mud and try to make something after the fact, is for the members of the Liberal Party, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78329" Type="2">Ajax—Pickering</Affiliation> and unfortunately now my friend from <Affiliation DbId="78429" Type="2">Hull—Aylmer</Affiliation>, to withdraw these ridiculous attacks, recognize that what they have alleged here is entirely wrong, and that what happened here was the appropriate due course of action. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126861">Again, as I said, Treasury Board approved the money. The democratically elected council of the City of Ottawa voted it down. It took the action on behalf of its constituents and the City of Ottawa does not need the member of Parliament from Hull getting in its face and telling it what it did democratically was inappropriate.</ParaText>

First, all committee evidence, as we know, is available because it is transcribed.

              <ParaText id="1126863">In any event, a civil suit was launched against the City of Ottawa and the outcome will show that the then minister was wrong.

              <ParaText id="1126864">The current <Affiliation DbId="105835" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation> interfered in the last municipal election campaign.

              <ParaText id="1126868">He was there. He answered these questions in a televised committee room. We had all the people before the committee who wanted to ask questions. It is interesting that this member apparently has an interest in this issue, and I know he is the deputy whip of the opposition so maybe he is doing this as part of his parliamentary responsibilities, but the fact is the minister made himself available. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126869">He was at committee to answer all these questions. He answered these questions numerous times. He availed himself to his local media. He has spoken to the local city councillors and has made himself entirely open on this process from start to finish. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126870">He has answered all these questions. As a matter of fact, if my memory serves me, at that committee meeting the Liberals ran out of questions and the meeting itself adjourned early.

              <ParaText id="1126877">The problem with the <Affiliation DbId="78950" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation>'s answer is that he was talking about the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver-Whistler, British Columbia. I was asking about something entirely different, namely the Olympic and Paralympic Games to be held in Beijing in the People's Republic of China in summer 2008. That is the problem with the answer.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1126887">Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague. He is right about his question. About a month ago, or a little more than a month ago, I misheard the beginning of his question and I answered as if he had asked a question about the 2010 Olympic Games instead of the 2008 Games. That was my fault, I was wrong, but I am grateful for the chance I have here today to correct my answer and give the real answer to his question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126888"> The answer is quite simply that he agreed. I think the origin of his question in April and again today goes back to the articles that were published in <I>Le Droit</I>, which expressed the concerns some people had about the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, in terms of services and respect. In fact, there was a lack of respect. Not everything had been done to show respect to athletes from Quebec and all Canadians and Quebeckers who want to see the games and listen to them in the official language of their choice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126889"> I can assure my colleague that we are aware of the concerns or problems there are. We are in the process of fixing those problems to the satisfaction of all Canadians, of all Quebeckers, of all francophones and all anglophones, so the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing will be enjoyable for all Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1126891"> My colleagues may rest assured that I am not going to run through all of the occasions on which Canada has failed in its responsibilities regarding the French fact in Canada and Quebec. In any event, the Bloc Québécois, Quebec athletes and trainers and the francophones of Canada will certainly be watching to make sure that Mandarin is not in fact the other so-called official language of the Canadian contingent in Beijing. Both French and English do have to be used. It is extremely important that no confusion remain on this point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126892"> Out of respect for the Quebec nation, it must be understood that it is a French-speaking nation with its own culture and that French takes precedence there. We respect our anglophone minority, the official minority of Quebec, and we want Canada to respect both official languages, and will insist on this, for as long as we are part of the Canadian federation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1126940">Mr. Chair, the truth of the matter is that Canada has taken perhaps the strongest measures in terms of sanctions against Burma. Those sanctions cover a host of issues from exports and imports to investment and personal assets. It is a whole range of very comprehensive sanctions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126941">On some of the matters in terms of how one tracks the data, it is very difficult, as the member knows, to track indirect investment flows.

We have not only a right to enforce it, but a responsibility to enforce it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1126955">Mr. Chair, it is a great honour for me to stand in this committee in this House and give my first, albeit brief, speech on foreign affairs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126956">The government's policy on foreign affairs and international trade is about principle and it is about commitment. We seek a more peaceful and a more secure world. We seek political and economic freedom. We seek the spread of freedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of law. Greater prosperity for Canadians through open markets and investment is another critical aspect of our approach to foreign policy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126957">Principles, however, must be connected with interests. This means setting priorities. It means making choices. Above all, it means following through.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126958">Let us talk about Afghanistan. In terms of Canadian interests and values, nowhere is our commitment more clear than in Afghanistan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126959">All members were part of the debate earlier this year on the future of Canada's mission in Afghanistan. The resolution passed by Parliament extended Canada's role there through June 2011. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126960">Not only did the resolution express the support of Parliament for the mission, it also sent a strong message to our NATO allies. That message had a strong effect at the NATO summit in Bucharest, giving us the leverage we needed to secure more support from our allies for the work we are doing in Afghanistan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126961"> That same strong message spoke clearly of Canada's commitment to the Afghan people. Our commitment can be seen in the 2,500 members of the Canadian Forces serving in Kandahar. It can be seen in the Canadian diplomats, development experts, corrections officers, civilian police and others contributing to the mission.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126962"> There will be no quick and easy fix or easy solutions in Afghanistan. And there is a long way to go. Nevertheless, we are making progress. Ministers and officials, the media, and individual Canadians have seen this in their own visits to Afghanistan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126963"> Canada is serving the cause of international peace and security in Afghanistan. We are playing our part as a member of the international community. Canadians know this and they are proud of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126964">What about the Americas and the United States? The government came to power with a commitment to improve Canada-U.S. relations. This we have done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126965"> Our strategy of working constructively with the United States administration is paying off. For example, we see it on softwood lumber, border security and broader foreign policy issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126966"> We have re-established a positive dialogue and a willingness to listen closely to each other. On every issue and at all levels we have worked to ensure that the partnership between Canada and the United States remains respectful, close and productive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126967">Canada is also taking a larger role in the Americas. We are laying the foundations to be a long term player in the region. We will contribute where we can to help defuse longstanding conflicts, promote freer trade and strengthen democratic governance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126968"> Haiti is an example of where we can contribute in the short term as well as in the long term. In the short term, Canadian Forces officers and civilian police are helping the country address its day to day security needs. At the same time, we are also strengthening Haitian security institutions, looking forward to the day when they can guarantee their own country's security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126969">Earlier this year, Canada announced a $19 million package to strengthen the capacity of the Haitian government and police forces to manage its borders. We are taking a similar approach to social and economic development. We have responded to Haiti's immediate needs, such as food, drinking water and medical aid. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="15">(1915)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1126970">At the same time, we are contributing to longer term social and economic development, for example, in the agricultural sector, to ensure a more secure food supply or an infrastructure where we are literally laying the foundations for a better future by funding a $75 million road construction project. Progress is being made, but it is a long term project and recent violence shows how fragile these gains can be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126971">Let us talk about emerging markets. Our third major priority is to strengthen Canada's presence in emerging markets, particularly India and China. The government is committed to helping Canadian business succeed in making Canada the destination of choice for foreign investment. We have set out our plans in the global commerce strategy and have backed up these plans to the tune of $100 million over the next two years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126972">What about the Arctic? Our foreign policy in the Arctic is based on the foundations of our integrated northern strategy. The goal of our approach is to support Canada's domestic policies, social and economic development, stronger local government institutions and environmental protection, including the critical issue of climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126973">The future of the north and of the Arctic is a matter of national and global importance. The region is integral to Canada's history and national identity. It is also critical to the future of the planet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126974">The Northwest Passage is part of Canada's internal waters. Canada's sovereignty over these waters is well established and based on historic title. The government has repeatedly made this clear. This will not change. Nor will the government's position on it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126975">What about Sudan? The hon. member referred to it earlier. Since January 2006, Canada has committed nearly $400 million for peace, humanitarian assistance and governance in Sudan. If we combine our UN peacekeeping assessments with our voluntary contributions, Canada will be providing up to $275 million in assistance to Sudan this year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126976">In March Canada announced that it would be increasing its assistance, but we will also set down some markers with Sudanese ministers, specifically that the future of our relations depends on Sudan's conduct within its own borders. We urged all parties in Sudan to end the violence in Darfur, to support the prompt and full deployment of the UN African Union mission in Darfur and to improve the human rights situation in all areas of the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126977">In the area of international trade, the goals of Canadian foreign policy are inseparable from our trade and investment strategy. The government believes that a strong, aggressive and forward looking trade and investment strategy is good for Canada, especially in this day of hypercompetitive emerging economies like China, India and Brazil.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126978">Initiatives like “Advantage Canada” are clearly positioning Canada as a more attractive destination for foreign investment and a partner of choice for global business. Take our Asia Pacific gateway initiative, an unprecedented effort to create more Asian trans-Pacific trade both to and through North America. Our global commerce strategy is another important part of our efforts to draw the world's attention to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126979"> A few weeks ago, I stood in the House to table legislation to enact Canada's first free trade agreement since 2001, with the EFTA countries of Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Today, we are signing a free trade agreement with Peru, an economic leader in Latin America. With the EFTA and Peru agreements, our global commerce strategy is getting Canada back on track and we are moving forward with a list of other negotiations around the world, with Colombia, the Caribbean community, the Dominican Republic, Jordan and South Korea. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126980">These agreements will give Canadian businesses and producers more competitive terms of access to key global markets. These efforts are part of a strategic suite of initiatives to get Canadians more involved in the global economy. These include foreign investment, promotion and protection agreements. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126981">These agreements will help Canadians build linkages to the global value chains that are driving business around the world today, such as air services agreements to foster the human links so vital to strong business relations, not to mention carrying high value cargo along global supply and value chains, as well as the science and technology cooperation agreements we are pursuing to work with other innovative countries to develop and market tomorrow's technological breakthroughs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1126982">Finally, there are the market plans being developed by our department and trade commissioners to zero in on the opportunities in global markets. These plans include new trade offices in key markets in China, India, Brazil and elsewhere. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126983">The global commerce strategy is a comprehensive road map that will help Canadian businesses and investors succeed in the global economy and continue building on our country's long-standing heritage as a trading nation. We are proud of our success to date and there will be much more to come in the time ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126984">On the issue of democracy and human rights, the government has also been proud to maintain Canada's enduring commitment to freedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of law. I will continue to make our views known bilaterally and in multilateral fora, such as the United Nations, in NATO, the G-8 and in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126985">Among the multilateral fora of importance to Canada it is la Francophonie. The French language and culture remain an integral to Canada's identity. We look forward to Summit 2008 this October in Quebec City and to the city's 400th anniversary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1126986">Let me close my remarks by saying a few words about my department. The Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade is made up of people that match our ambitions on the world stage, with the required talent, the dedication and the energy.

It is for the purpose of keeping the people of Quebec and Canada informed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127003"> Everyone knows that when the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78461" Type="2">Beauce</Affiliation> was the foreign affairs minister, he forgot some documents at Ms. Couillard's place. She has said that they were forgotten around the middle of April, or shortly after the NATO summit in Bucharest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127004"> Originally, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said during his press conference that the foreign affairs minister resigned because he had left classified confidential documents—those were his words—in non-secure places. This is what led to his resignation because it was a serious mistake. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127005"> I would like to ask a question, and I suppose that it will be the House Leader who answers and not the new <Affiliation DbId="124438" Type="96">foreign affairs minister</Affiliation>. If they have strict security rules at the Department of Foreign Affairs, how is it possible that the neither this department nor the office of the minister at the time, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78461" Type="2">Beauce</Affiliation>, noticed that the documents had disappeared over the ensuing five weeks? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127006"> This all seems very nebulous to me and I would like a clear answer. It has nothing to do with the private lives of the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78461" Type="2">Beauce</Affiliation> or Ms. Couillard. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127007"> How could documents, some of which the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has described as “classified”, possibly just disappear for five weeks from the radar screens of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the office of its former minister? </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1127008">Mr. Chair, the issue is one of documents that were left inappropriately by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78461" Type="2">Beauce</Affiliation> in an unsecured place and some were classified documents. As has been observed by my friend, it was inappropriate for them to be left in that place. Whether it be for five weeks, or five days or five hours, it matters not. It does not matter whether it was Madame Couillard's home or, as I have said on other occasions, the front steps of the Parliament buildings. In either case it would have been in appropriate. That is why the resignation of the <Affiliation DbId="78461" Type="2">minister of foreign affairs</Affiliation> was offered, because he had violated the rules.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127009">That I think led to a question about what measures the department had in place for tracking documents. There is a government security policy, and it is obviously too lengthy for me to answer in the brief time I have. For the benefit of my friend, he can review it on the Treasury Board Secretariat website. It outlines all the requirements that have to be followed by all departments for documents. That policy is also supplemented by what are known as operational standards. Those standards provide some additional guidance to departments in a number of areas, including how to meet the requirements of the Security of Information Act in physical and personnel security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127010">As I have indicated as well in the House, Foreign Affairs and International Trade is conducting a review. It will continue to operate in the future to ensure that all sensitive materials are properly protected and treated appropriately.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1127018">I have indicated that there are standards that must be upheld. The standards are quite clear and in this case the standards were not upheld.

The <Affiliation DbId="105836" Type="4">Leader of the Government in the House of Commons</Affiliation> told us on several occasions that the government was not made aware of the disappearances until Sunday, and the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> only learned of it on Monday. For a period of five weeks, documents were missing from the Department of Foreign Affairs. Yet, they tell us that the rules are strict; that there are standards that were not respected by the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, and he has paid the price. Yes, he has paid the price; but how will they ensure that it does not happen again the next time a minister forgets documents at someone’s home, or loses them or puts them under the mattress and forgets that they are under the mattress? I am not just talking about the Minister of Foreign Affairs. It could be the Minister of International Trade or National Defence or any other minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127020"> How can they guarantee that the departments concerned will quickly identify those documents as missing,so that we do not relive the situation we have been through in the past few weeks?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127021"> They are not answering our question.

              <ParaText id="1127058">In fact, it was the order paper questions that I put forward and the responses from the government that established the following. When I asked the government what Canadian companies, individuals and public pension funds have direct investments in Burma, what is the total of those investments and how can we establish what Canadian companies have investments in Burma, the minister replied earlier that it was very difficult to track and if there was any way to do it, he would like to know and would like to hear suggestions. However, he was talking about indirect investments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127059"> My question is about direct investments. According to the document I received, which was the government's response officially from the department, there is no requirement for Canadian companies to register their business activities with the department; sources of information are derived from various non-government organizations. Then it goes on about how it might get that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127060">My question is very specific. If this government were to suggest that it has the toughest sanctions on Burma, how could it do that when its own department is saying there is no requirement for Canadian companies to register at all vis-à-vis direct investment in Burma? Could the minister tell me how he can know what investments are in Burma when there is no requirement for Canadian companies to register direct investments in Burma?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1127063">Mr. Chair, sadly, I am going to have to ask a question of the minister. If he is saying that this is too difficult and it is hard to track, then how is it that he can enforce the sanctions at all? What he is saying to us is that we have the toughest sanctions but it turns out to be a paper tiger because the departmental response is saying very directly there is no requirement for Canadian companies to register their business activities with the department. Are we to rely on Google? How is it that we are going to actually enforce the rules? How is the government going to enforce the rules on sanctions vis-à-vis Burma?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127064">The last point I will suggest to him is that he has the tool in his hands. It is SEMA. The Special Economic Measures Act allows the government to tailor sanctions. It could, if it chose to, require all companies that are investing in Burma to register with the government and put the onus on them to pay for it. Why is the government not doing that?</ParaText>

It has been said that tying one's food aid says more about wanting to helping one's own country than wanting to help people in other countries. When we took office, only 50% of food aid was untied. This government has gone forward and completely untied 100% of food aid. This means that food can now be acquired more locally, regionally and support local farmers and producers in those countries and regions.</ParaText>

Regarding Mr. Sensenbrenner, if he were hired, what value for money did he provide in his services with the embassy? What steps has the department taken to ensure that the source of the leaked document was in DFAIT? It cannot be a matter of simply too many emails. It hired these private investigators. They cost over $140,000. The member cannot simply tell us that after the investigation, there were too many emails to follow up, or they chose not to pick up the phone and make the calls.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1127186">When I was Minister for La Francophonie, we accomplished a number of things. In the first weeks, I went to Paris to meet with His Excellency Abdou Diouf, Secretary General of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie. There, I announced that Canada would make a direct contribution of $900,000 to support institution building and the modernization of the OIF. It was important for Canada to modernize the OIF and make it more transparent and efficient.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1127190">Today I am going to talk about the international institution known as la Francophonie.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127191"> When we talk about la Francophonie, we first have to talk about the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, which is known by the acronym OIF, and about all of the agencies, decision-making bodies, ministerial conferences and operators surrounding it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127192"> First and foremost, la Francophonie is an idea, we could say an ideal, that originated in the early 1960s, at a time when the great architecture of the United Nations had been put in place. The UN programs had not yet hit their stride, the international community recognized the need for a kind of Marshall Plan on a global scale, and decolonization, particularly in Africa, was underway. The idea was an ambitious one: to take advantage of a common language to build bonds of cooperation and strengthen natural affinities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127193"> The spirit behind la Francophonie is a desire to cooperate and to discuss contemporary problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127194"> Within la Francophonie, there has been a process of evolution that has produced an amalgam of institutions, which vary in their specialization and the autonomy they enjoy. The oldest of them is the Conference of Ministers of Education of Countries Using French as a Common Language, CONFEMEN. It was created in 1960 and its purpose is to encourage dialogue, cooperation and coordination in the area of education policies and to conduct high-level discussions about the future of education. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127195"> In 1961, the Association des universités partiellement ou entièrement de langue française was created in Montreal, and it has since become the Agence universitaire de la Francophonie. Today it has a membership of 659 institutions in 60 countries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127196"> In 1967, the Association internationale des parlementaires de langue française was created, and today it is known as the Assemblée parlementaire de la Francophonie.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127197"> A second permanent ministerial conference was established in 1969: the Conference of Youth and Sports Ministers of Countries sharing the use of French, CONFEJES. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127198"> And last, in 1970, at the impetus of the Presidents of Tunisia, Niger and Senegal, an intergovernmental institution for la Francophonie was established, with a broader mandate: the Agency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation. It has served to provide more structure for international Francophonie, and over the years it has adapted to the needs of the member countries. It is now called the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127199">La Francophonie has continued to build on those foundations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127200"> The mayors of Paris and Quebec City started the International Association of Francophone Mayors.

              <ParaText id="1127201"> The first summit of heads of state and government of la Francophonie was held in Paris in 1986. Canada eagerly hosted the second summit in Quebec City in 1987, and we continue to act as host country on a fairly regular basis.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1127203">La Francophonie is one of the only international intergovernmental entities where the Canadian provinces can have a seat. In the early 1970s, the Government of Canada concluded an agreement with Quebec on its participation in la Francophonie events. The same agreement was later reached with New Brunswick. These two provinces have government participant status, sit in on the proceedings, make their own financial contributions and bring with them real expertise on issues in their own jurisdictions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127204">I have a few more words about la Francophonie: the OIF today has 53 member states and governments, two associate states and 13 observer states, from five continents, that are united by the French language. It is a forum where Canada has some clout and influence. We are the second largest provider of funds after France, with a contribution of more than $40 million a year. Some $19 million comes from the Department of Foreign Affairs. The rest essentially comes from CIDA and Canadian Heritage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127205">Our participation in la Francophonie reflects the linguistic duality of our country and our attachment to cultural diversity and the values of solidarity. It is the multilateral forum of choice for promoting the major objectives of Canada's foreign policy and we have strongly encouraged la Francophonie to become more political. The OIF has answered that call and is now taking political action in line with its four fundamental missions: to promote the French language and cultural and linguistic diversity; to promote peace, democracy and human rights; to support education, training, higher learning and research; and to develop cooperation for sustainable development and solidarity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127206">Canada can have its voice heard on issues like security, the rule of law, good governance, human rights and development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127207">We will continue to contribute to the institutional reform of la Francophonie and to encourage the organization to have clear objectives and a structure that maximizes its effectiveness. The OIF's good governance depends on its people. We have complete confidence in the current secretary general, His Excellency, Abdou Diouf, former president of Senegal, and in the OIF administrator—the secretary general's right-hand man— Clément Duhaime, a Canadian.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127208"> We are also very proud of the progress that has been made in regard to the TV5 Monde international television network. As the chair of the conference of ministers responsible for TV5 Monde, I had the pleasure of announcing that discussions among senior officials from the partner governments have led to the development of a draft agreement that preserves the multilateral, pluralistic nature of TV5 Monde. This network plays a major role in promoting the culture and values of la Francophonie and must remain a joint project of this international organization. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127209"> Discussions among the partner governments have always been held in an excellent climate of cooperation and collaboration.

              <ParaText id="1127210"> This will be the 12th time that the heads of state and government of la Francophonie have met. This time the summit will be held in Quebec City from October 17 to 19, 2008. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127211"> The governments of Canada and Quebec are the co-hosts and Canada will chair the summit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127212"> We have been working very closely with our partners—both the participating provinces and the other member countries—to deliver a summit worthy of the name. Four issues—broken down into sub-topics—have been selected. The first is democracy and la Francophonie, including preventive diplomacy and strengthening of the organization’s mediation capacities, as well as democratic life. The second is the environment, where we will emphasize water and sustainable forest management. The third concerns economic governance, including the principles of transparency and corporate social responsibility. Finally, the fourth is the French language, which is at the heart of la Francophonie. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127213"> The preparations are proceeding well. An organizational secretariat has been established in Quebec City and started its technical and logistical work in September 2007, in accordance with federal management guidelines. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1127214">The governments of Canada and Quebec have each contributed $16 million to the organization of the summit and New Brunswick has contributed $750,000. In addition, the federal government is responsible for the full cost of security, which brings its total contribution to more than $57 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127215">In recent months, organizing the summit has provided many opportunities to strengthen cooperation between Ottawa and Quebec City. At last November's ministerial conference in Vientiane, Canada assumed the presidency of the ministerial conference of la Francophonie.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127216">We should not forget what we are doing for the French language here in our own country. On March 20, the International Day of La Francophonie, I announced financial assistance for the cross-country tour of Francoforce, which will run from May 30 to September 2, 2008. Funding of $1.1 million will help the Fédération culturelle canadienne-française coordinate this major tour, in close cooperation with the Fédération des communautés francophones et acadienne du Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127217">In March, our government announced financial assistance for various major projects in minority language communities in New Brunswick.

In addition, we announced $714,970 in financial support for seven organizations working with francophone communities in Alberta.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1127224">Furthermore, if Canada wants to be an important player on the international stage, and I believe everyone feels the same way about this, we have to belong to major multilateral organizations, such as la Francophonie. But do we not also have an obligation to ensure that our actions on the international stage are as effective as possible? Is it not in our interest to see to it that the performance of the institutions to which we belong and contribute meets certain standards of good governance and management? Where is la Francophonie on that? Are we satisfied? What remains to be done in that regard?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127225">It would certainly be reassuring to know that Canada is still working toward more relevant and effective multilateralism. Madam minister, I will conclude by asking you to tell us how Canada's participation in la Francophonie corresponds—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1127274">Can the <Affiliation DbId="124437" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> tell us if he is going to change his approach and drop the secrecy adopted at Montebello in particular? The government should have an open approach enabling citizens to be engaged in the negotiations. In this way, the relationship between Canada, the United States and Mexico will be centred on bettering the future of North America, particularly with respect to competition with the rest of the world, emerging countries and China in particular.</ParaText>

It was a very good idea at the time. There was a recognition that trade relations across the Canada-U.S. border were increasingly defined by a number of very small regulatory anomalies and impediments. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1127278">Mr. Chair, it is a great pleasure for me to rise in the House today to speak about Canada's engagement with Africa as well as our pursuit of opportunities in the emerging Asian markets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127279">Asia is a key focus of our efforts under our global commerce strategy. Our plan is to help Canadian businesses and investors benefit from everything the global economy has to offer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127280">Today, I would like to outline how our strategy is helping us pursue and build new opportunities in Asia. There is a staggering diversity of opportunity for our businesses and investors to succeed in the Asian markets, especially on the investment front. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127281">Vietnam, for instance, is a growing and dynamic market for Canadian investors. In 2006, the stock of Canadian direct investment in Vietnam was $142 million, an almost 60% increase in one year, with more large projects planned, particularly in the natural resources sector. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127282">To help continue forging these links, Canada is launching a new chapter in our bilateral investment relationship through the negotiation of a foreign investment protection and promotion agreement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127283">Our goal is a high quality agreement that will enhance the Canadian investment community and our bilateral commercial links with Vietnam.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127284">Indonesia is another important investment destination, ranking fourth in Asia, with a stock of $3.12 billion worth of Canadian investment. Canadian and Indonesian officials have held two rounds of exploratory discussions so far toward a FIPA, and we plan to hold the first round of negotiations shortly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127285">Turning to Singapore, Canadian negotiators are continuing to push for a bilateral free trade agreement. As pointed out in our report, Singapore is a commercial business hub and springboard into Southeast Asian value chains. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127286">Building more commercial links to Singapore through a free trade agreement, for example, would greatly enhance Canada's profile across the region and bring many benefits to Canadian businesses, particularly in the areas of investment and services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127287">China is another top priority of our commercial efforts. Over the years we have built a strong and sophisticated commercial relationship with China. Indeed, not long ago, both the <Affiliation DbId="124437" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="78751" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> visited China to reinforce this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127288">A comprehensive market plan has been developed in cooperation with Canada's business community to continue making connections between Canadian expertise and Chinese demand in a number of sectors. We are planning to add more trade commissioners in China to give our businesses the support they need to outdo their competitors and capture opportunities in a number of key sectors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127289">Our global commerce strategy also places a key focus on driving more two-way investment between our countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127290">Now, I would like to turn to India. Canada and India have long been partners on the world stage. As I observed during my visit to India earlier this year, Canada and India share common values of freedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of law. It is vital that Canada maintain a strong relationship with India, the world's largest democracy and an increasingly important international partner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127291">This partnership extends into the commercial realm where our nations have built a sophisticated business relationship that saw our two-way trade reach an all-time record high last year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127292">Like China, we have developed a targeted market plan for India that emphasizes opportunities in key sectors, including agriculture, oil and gas, electric power, aerospace, information and communications technology, infrastructure and service industries. Canada has a proven expertise in all of these areas and can help India as it continues its economic ascent. Two-way investment is another hallmark of the Canada-India relationship. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127293">Last year, we concluded negotiations toward a Canada-India foreign promotion and protection agreement that will give investors in both countries the access and protection they need in each of our markets. At this point I would like to emphasize that it was the current <Affiliation DbId="124437" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> who was instrumental in signing this agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127294">Since the signing of the Canada-India science and technology cooperation agreement in 2005, researchers from both countries have been working together to develop and commercialize tomorrow's technological breakthroughs. We also recognize the importance of a strong Canadian presence in the Indian marketplace.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="00">(2100)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1127295">We currently have commercial representation in five Indian cities and our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> recently announced the opening of two new trade offices in Hyderabad and Kolkata, formerly known as Calcutta, as well as additional commercial staff to our missions in Mumbai and New Delhi. An expanded presence in India will allow Canada to create even more commercial connections between our two nations and create wealth, prosperity and opportunity for both countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127296">Finally, we cannot talk about our efforts in capturing more business in Asia without talking about the Asia-Pacific gateway and the corridor initiative. The initiative is a bold visionary project to boost our west coast transportation infrastructure capabilities and to create the premier gateway of choice between Asia and North America.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127297">With our partners in the provinces and the private sector, we are making an unprecedented effort to boost our transportation and logistics systems and establish new links between North America and the Asian giants. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127298">We are seeing solid progress with the recent opening of the new expanded Fairview Container Terminal at the port of Prince Rupert, giving it a significant advantage over key American ports. The gateway project is yet another example of Canada's commitment to our Asian partners and of our clear focus on creating two-way supply chains that will drive trade between our countries into the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127299">I would now like to turn to Africa. I would like to talk about Canada's long history of dedicated commitment to Africa. Both in Canada and Africa, Canadians have worked for and with Africans to alleviate suffering and improve lives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127300">Today, many Canadians, and this includes a growing African diaspora, maintain this commitment. They are involved through family ties, churches, mosques, schools, and cultural and community organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127301">In spite of the often large negative impression the news headlines leave, Africa has made real progress compared with a decade ago with more reform-minded democratic leaders taking responsibility; more prudent economic management with GDP growth up and inflation down; fewer conflicts, six ended in the past 10 years; and more democratic elections, 45 elections in sub-Saharan Africa in the past five years, of which two-thirds were deemed free and fair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127302">However, social, economic and health challenges remain immense. Serious conflict and governance problems persist. The progress achieved is fragile and must be sustained. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127303">The government has pursued a focused and principled approach in sub-Saharan Africa. Our values are those all Canadians cherish: freedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of law. Our interests comprise major aid commitments, growing trade and investments, and dealing with key regional security risks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127304">At this time I would also like to acknowledge the hard work the <Affiliation DbId="111559" Type="4">Minister of International Cooperation</Affiliation> has done in promoting the Africa agenda where she has made a difference and she is fighting for effective aid delivery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127305">Canada is meeting its commitments to Africa. We are doubling annual aid to Africa from 2003-04 to 2008-09 to $2.1 billion. We will meet this objective. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127306">Last December, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> announced a $1.3 billion contribution over three years to the World Bank's International Development Association. This represents a 25% increase in Canada's contribution. About half of these funds will go to Africa. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127307">Last year the <Affiliation DbId="111559" Type="4">Minister of International Cooperation</Affiliation> announced nearly $400 million for development in Africa. This includes our contribution to the African Development Bank.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127308">Canada is already obtaining better results and making a difference, especially in countries where we have a long term, well established aid partnership. We continue to make progress in poverty reduction, health and education, democratic governance, and peace and security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127309">For example, Ghana is on track to halve extreme poverty by 2015, thereby meeting a key millennium development goal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127310">Earlier this year I visited Sudan where our government announced a new Canadian investment of up to $275 million in security, diplomacy and aid initiatives, as was just announced by the <Affiliation DbId="124437" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> for our commitment to Sudan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127311">Canada has played a leadership role in supporting international efforts to establish sustainable peace and long term stability in Sudan. We remain committed to those goals. All parties continue to work toward building the culture of peace and stability throughout the country and to support sustained efforts to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127312">Since we are on topic of aid, let me say that we know we must also make our aid more effective and improve results. The government will do this by bringing more focus, more efficiency, and more accountability to our programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127313">The government has focused attention on the regional dimension of these issues. We are helping Africans to build and strengthen their security architecture.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="05">(2105)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1127314">We support the African Union and other regional institutions, such as the Economic Community of West African States through capacity building and peace support programs and peacekeeping operations. This will enhance the ability of Africans to resolve conflict, improve regional stability and protect civilians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127315">In conclusion, Canada's global commerce strategy is squarely focused on capturing opportunities, both in the most exciting global market as well as working to ensure that Canada is there standing for Africa.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1127318">Mr. Chair, I appreciated the parliamentary secretary's remarks. I would particularly like to return to his references to the continent of Africa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127319">As he rightfully noted, the continent has made some progress of which I think all people of the world are quite happy for. But there are still challenges and there are still difficulties involved in Africa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127320">There have been a number of conflicts and while some of them have successfully progressed, I think particularly of the situations in the Congo, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Burundi and the Ivory Coast. They have all progressed in a positive way, but there are other situations that continue to concern me and concern other Canadians who have an interest in the welfare of the people of Africa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127321">In particular, let me note a few of the countries and perhaps the parliamentary secretary can respond in each situation on what the government's response has been. I think particularly of the Sudan and the humanitarian situation there, the ongoing violence. I know the UN and the African Union are involved there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127322">There is the situation in northern Uganda with the fanatical Lord's Resistance Army still causing a major disruption. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127323">In Somalia, again, there is still an ongoing problem internally with its long problems of political, humanitarian and other forms of unrest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127324">More recently, we have seen problems in Zimbabwe and Kenya. In Zimbabwe it has been with the current election turbulence and the economic collapse in the country. Kenya, long regarded as one of the pillars of Africa, has gone through an election situation that has been somewhat stressful. Hopefully, it has moved to a positive resolution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127325">I would appreciate the parliamentary secretary's response on what the government is doing to assist in these countries.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1127327">In reference to the peace process in Uganda, during the visit by the former foreign affairs minister and myself, we met with the chief mediator of the northern Uganda peace process. The minister emphasized the need for the Lord's Resistance Army to sign and to begin implementing the final peace agreement without further delay. Canada has contributed $8 million, including $3.5 million toward the peace process. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127328">Since 2006, Canada has provided over $19 million in support of humanitarian operations for Somalia, as well as $4.5 million in support of regional refugee operations.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1127395">Mr. Chair, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of International Trade, it is certainly a privilege to rise in the House today to talk for a few minutes about the implementation of our global commerce strategy and how it will help Canadian companies and investors succeed and thrive in the global economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127396">A few weeks ago, the hon. <Affiliation DbId="124557" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation> tabled in the House legislation to enact Canada's first free trade agreement since 2001, an agreement with the European Free Trade Association nations of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. It is an important agreement for Canada, one that gives our businesses competitive terms of access in these important markets and a new link in the growing network of European supply chains.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127397">Just today, we signed a free trade agreement with Peru, an economic leader in Latin America. This new agreement will open new doors for exporters, service providers and investors in this important market. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127398">These agreements are watersheds in Canada's evolving trade strategy. They send a clear signal to the international community that Canada is back in the global commerce game. And they prove that this government is committed to sharpening Canada's competitive positioning in the global economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127399">We believe that a strong, aggressive and forward-looking trade and investment strategy is good for Canada. The global economy is evolving and we have to adapt accordingly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127400">When we talk of trade today, we are talking about “integrative” trade: in other words, the whole range of commercial exchanges that go into creating wealth and prosperity in the global economy. Of course, this includes exports and imports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127401"> It also includes investment, innovation and technology exchanges. These are all part of creating economic opportunity and success.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127402">The level of competition is enormous. Trading nations like ours are facing a competitive landscape like never before, from traditional competitors such as the U.S., Australia and the EU as well as emerging giants such as Russia, Brazil, India and China.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127403">In addition to this fierce competition, we also are facing a range of other challenges, including a high dollar and a slowdown in the U.S. economy. These challenges risk eroding the competitiveness of our exports, our ability to attract foreign investment and ultimately our ability to participate in global value chains.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127404"> It is also a world where governments are competing with governments to support their businesses and investors in the right ways, in the right markets, with the right tools.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127405">That is where our global commerce strategy, led by the hon. <Affiliation DbId="124557" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation>, comes in. Under “Advantage Canada”, this government has demonstrated its commitment to creating a more competitive economy on several fronts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127406">From reducing red tape and streamlining regulations to an ambitious series of tax cuts, to education, infrastructure and a range of strategic investments and initiatives, steps are being taken to create a more competitive domestic economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127407">Our Asia-Pacific gateway and corridor initiative is a good example. It is a bold, visionary effort to boost our west coast transportation infrastructure and create a gateway of choice for shippers and businesses looking for the most efficient link between North America and the Asian marketplaces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127408">Our global commerce strategy fits squarely into our efforts to create a more globally competitive economy. It flows from our recognition that to be globally competitive our businesses need to be supported in the right markets and, again, with the right tools. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127409">Of course, market access for our businesses and investors will always be a crucial focus of our work. That is why the WTO will be our preferred forum for market access. We will continue working with our partners to push hard for a successful conclusion to the Doha round.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127410">In the meantime, we are stepping up our efforts on the bilateral front, first and foremost as a partner in the enormously successful North American commercial platform. Canada benefits greatly from being part of NAFTA and we are working closely with the U.S. and Mexico on a range of issues to keep trade, investment and talent moving across our borders and ensure that the North American partnership remains strong and prosperous. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="35">(2135)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1127411">This is especially crucial in this day of an economic slowdown in the U.S. South of the border, protectionist voices are growing louder. It is up to all of us who believe in a strong North American platform to remind people that it is a competitive world out there and we need this platform today more than ever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127412">Thanks to NAFTA, the world looks at North America as an integrated continental marketplace of 440 million people bound together by an ambitious free trade agreement that has created one of the most prosperous commercial platforms anywhere on the planet. We need to support this message with concrete action to make the North American platform more competitive and help all three countries deal with the challenge posed by commercial powerhouses such as China, India and Brazil.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127413">Now is not the time to turn our backs on the platform but indeed to rededicate ourselves to it and make it even more competitive in the years to come. With our American and Mexican partners, that is exactly what we are doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127414">We are also getting more aggressive on the bilateral front outside of North America. In addition to the EFTA and Peru agreements, our negotiators are busy with a long list of other negotiations around the world, with Colombia, the Caribbean community, the Dominican Republic, Jordan and South Korea, for instance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127415">We are engaged in a joint study with the European Union on the cost and benefits of a closer, economic partnership. We are looking to launch negotiations with new EFTA partners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127416">The results of these efforts should provide our businesses and investors with new links and improved access to new markets, but it is not all about FTAs. We are focused on other kinds of agreements too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127417"> Air services agreements are a good example. We currently have more than 70 in place. Since last January, we have successfully negotiated new or updated existing agreements with nine countries, including Japan, Ireland, Kuwait, Jordan, Iceland, New Zealand, Singapore, Mexico, and Barbados. That sounds like a country and western song, Mr. Chair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127418">We also recently launched negotiations with the EU toward a comprehensive air transport agreement. This is expected to result in an open skies framework between Canada and all 27 member states, including eight countries where rights currently do not exist at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127419">We are also engaging in consultations with a number of key bilateral partners, including the Philippines, South Korea, India, Japan, China and Hong Kong, to continue liberalizing air services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127420">Investment agreements are another good example of how we can work with our partners to create more opportunities. Canadian firms and investors clearly recognize the importance of investing globally. To support them in these efforts, Canada has 23 foreign investment protection and promotion agreements, or FIPAs, in place with key partners around the world, including, most recently, Peru.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127421">We also have concluded negotiations with India and Jordan. Negotiations are now under way with China, Kuwait and Vietnam and exploratory discussions are being held with a number of countries in Asia and Africa. These agreements will help Canadian firms and investors build their own links in the value and supply chains driving business around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127422">We cannot forget the importance of research, science and technology in a competitive economy. Our recently announced science and technology strategy is helping us to create a more competitive and dynamic business environment that encourages investment in S and T and innovation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127423">The strategy also highlights the importance of partnerships with other innovative countries to access foreign knowledge, technologies and expertise in creating marketable products. That is why science and technology cooperation agreements are another focus of our work under the global commerce strategy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127424">Canada currently has agreements in place with countries such as China and India, which are helping to boost research and develop collaboration and bring new high tech products to market quickly. We are negotiating similar arrangements with Chile and Brazil. These agreements are a great example of how countries can join forces, build off each other's strengths and put exciting innovative products to work on the global stage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127425">We are also keenly aware of the important role strategic government services can play in helping connect our businesses and investors to global opportunity. For example, the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade is working closely with Canadian businesses to develop a series of targeted, sector-based market plans for key markets. These plans embrace the full range of international business activities, from exports, imports and investments to science and technology, licensing and the negotiation of market access through trade and investment agreements.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="40">(2140)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1127426">We also enjoy a wide-reaching international commercial network. We currently have about 900 trade commissioners active in over 150 cities around the world, including 13 regional offices across Canada. These dedicated men and women are adapting to new global business models like integrated trade and helping to create new partnerships with nations around the world that will benefit all of our economies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127427">To support them in these efforts, we are opening new trade offices in the world's most exciting markets, including China, India and Brazil. We are committed to offering the right services in the right markets for Canadian businesses to help them succeed and thrive in the new global economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127428">The global commerce strategy is a road map to help our businesses and investors adapt to the complex reality of integrated trade. Through it, we are getting Canada back in the global commerce game. We are sharpening our competitive advantages and helping Canadians create wealth and opportunity in some of the world's most exciting markets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127429">I respectfully ask for the support of all hon. members as we take more steps to create a competitive and prosperous Canada in the years to come and bolster Canada's solid position as a natural business destination and a partner of choice for international business for years to come.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1127568">Mr. Chair, I want to thank the parliamentary secretary for his hard work on the foreign affairs and international development committee, as well as for his speeches here this evening. I would like to follow up on some of his remarks in regard to hemispheric security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127569">The Americas, like other parts of the world, are facing new forms of security risks and challenges in the 21st century. They are trying to adopt programs to help facilitate those concerns. Canada needs a strategy as well and we are developing that strategy. We need to strengthen security and the rule of law in this hemisphere. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127570">Of concern in some of the Americas is the violence and the drugs there. How can we stop violence and drugs there before they come here? Canada must face up to the challenges that diseases and emerging forms of lethal viruses such as the Avian flu pose to our collective safety and well-being.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127571">As we enter the hurricane season in this hemisphere, I think all of us are still horrified by the pictures that we have seen coming out of Burma as well as the pictures following the earthquake in China. This should serve as a chilling wake-up call that disasters can wreak havoc on citizens and on economies just as much as terrorism and wars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127572">In the case of the Americas, these security challenges are not halfway around the world but quite literally on our doorstep. The parliamentary secretary mentioned that 2.5 million Canadians travel to the region every year. I think of the citizens in those countries and those Canadians who could be in harm's way. I think of the potential diseases that could inflict the region and could easily be brought back to our cities. A doctor in Chestermere Lake, Alberta, has written to me a number of times with concerns about the kinds of diseases that could make their way back to Canada and hurt our economy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1127575">As for the question, which is extremely important and timely, I would like to first point out that after 13 years of neglecting the Americas, Canada is back and playing an active role. We are re-engaging with the region. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127576">There are indeed security challenges in the Americas. Because of our desire to protect Canadians at home and abroad, as well as our neighbours in the hemisphere, we have developed a multi-pronged approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127577">On health and pandemic concerns, Canada is focused on building regional solutions to the leading health issues. Working with Health Canada and the Pan American Health Organization, we are developing national policies and programs that reflect the commitment of countries to work with us toward viable and effective programs. We will achieve results by providing the required training and expertise to ensure countries are better equipped to address these concerns on their own and for the long term.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127578">My colleague is quite correct in referring to the unfortunate events that have taken place in Burma. Canada is very concerned by the frequency and the increasing impact of natural disasters, including those that occur in the Americas. We are working to actively promote and support disaster risk reduction activities in the hemisphere. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127579">For instance, in 2007 Canada announced a $20 million program to help communities, governments and regional institutions in the Caribbean enhance their disaster preparedness and response capabilities, as well as another $20 million for the new Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127580">Canada also has a history of responding rapidly and appropriately to natural disasters around the world and is working to further strengthen the international disaster response system. Over the last two fiscal years, for instance, Canada has provided $7.5 million in humanitarian assistance to meet the needs of the areas in the Americas affected by natural disasters and has been working with regional and international agencies to enhance response capabilities in the Americas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127581">These are examples of this government's actions which demonstrate that we are well positioned and motivated to respond to the security challenges in the hemisphere.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1127583">Mr. Chair, I would like to begin by saying that I find it very interesting that we are discussing international issues. In a former life, when I taught secondary school, I took part in or set up UN debating clubs in four different schools. I myself took part in the first Southern Ontario Model United Nations Assembly in 1977. I was the ambassador from Lebanon, a country that was going through a very difficult time then. Because of that experience, I have always had an interest in and an affinity for international affairs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127584">A number of issues interest me. I would like to know what Canada's position is on la Francophonie, the Canadian International Development Agency and the <Affiliation DbId="124437" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> and where we are headed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127585">I will start with the Ottawa convention, which expired in 2007. Not long ago, in November 2007, when I was in Laos with the Minister for La Francophonie, we met with an NGO that was working on mine clearance. In Laos, during the war in Vietnam, the Americans—who always denied it—dropped roughly 10 million bombs, a third of which did not explode. When you go to Laos, you see men working in the fields who are missing a leg. The same is true of boys. This is an extremely difficult situation. Canada was a major partner. Thanks to CIDA and la Francophonie, Canada helped Laos clear mines and unearth the bombs dropped by American B-52s. They did not explode because they were dropped from too low an altitude.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127586">That said, I have a question for the <Affiliation DbId="124439" Type="4">Minister for La Francophonie</Affiliation>. Since Laos is a member of the international French-speaking community, I would like to know what sort of support Canada is providing for Laos and the other countries in this regard. The Ottawa convention was an extraordinary treaty on anti-personnel mines and mine clearance. It expired in 2007, and there was no indication that the government wanted to renew the treaty.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1127587">Mr. Chair, our government supports the Ottawa accord and we have done much work regarding landmines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127588"> In fact, as an example, in Afghanistan alone and with our support, 1.3 billion square metres of land have been cleared, in 1,700 communities. More than 520,000 mines and more than 8,200,000 pieces of unexploded ordnance have been destroyed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127589">Similar kinds of activities are happening in many countries where we are working on this. We work with the Department of Foreign Affairs, which undertakes demining activities as well. When I was in Colombia, we had discussions about the work being done there on demining. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127590">Unfortunately, landmines are prevalent in many countries in conflict. We work with the governments. We work with the United Nations. In fact, in 2007 we contributed a further $80 million to the United Nations Mine Action Service, which will extend until the year 2012. We have certainly responded in those areas and are working with governments where landmines are a concern. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1127591">As we all know, these are dangerous not only to people who are trying to be productive and undertake agriculture and move around in their countries so they can pursue their livelihoods, but also unfortunate is the effect this has on children. I know that this government is very concerned about that. The children are trying to go to school and enjoy themselves in play as well as pursue their activities around their towns and villages.</ParaText>
