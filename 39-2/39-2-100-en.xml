The example that she has set in her display of bravery and selflessness and the willingness to step in when a fellow human being was in danger should inspire us all.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1123105">A new era where “the interests of the country will have priority over partisan and religious interests” will only unfold if Lebanese people of all persuasions focus on the national interest and guard against the influence peddling of foreign countries.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1123414">I have examined closely the documentation cited and the comments made during question period on that day. The affidavit is a lengthy description by a party official of alleged election advertising transactions and arrangements. Contrary to the impression left by the parliamentary secretary, the affidavit in no way supports the pointed insinuation of wrongdoing he made regarding the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78455" Type="2">Ottawa—Vanier</Affiliation>. Similarly, the Chair cannot find anything in the affidavit that contradicts the very clear assertions made by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78455" Type="2">Ottawa—Vanier</Affiliation> on the matter at issue and in particular his statement found at page 5168 of the <I>Debates</I> for April 28, 2008.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123415">As Speaker, I can fully appreciate that the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78455" Type="2">Ottawa—Vanier</Affiliation> believes the parliamentary secretary attacked his reputation on the basis of the remarks he made. However, it is difficult for the Chair to find a prima facie question of privilege. Members may clearly disagree on the propriety of certain events that are alleged to have taken place; they may even dispute their legality, but I do not believe it is the role of the Speaker to settle that argument. My only role is to determine whether the remarks were unparliamentary and whether they constitute such a grave attack as to impede the hon. member for Ottawa—Vanier in the performance of his duties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123416">Given the differing views of both hon. members, and the actual words used by the parliamentary secretary, it is difficult for the Chair to regard the matter as anything other than a matter of debate. On the same ground that I ruled on similar questions for which I gave rulings on October 5, 2006, and again recently on April 10, 2008, I am, therefore, unable to find a basis for a prima facie breach of privilege.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1123432">Members will recall that the bill was first introduced into the House in the 39th session of Parliament as Bill <Document DbId="2590516" Type="3">C-44</Document>. It has been re-introduced into the House as Bill <Document DbId="3095171" Type="3">C-21</Document> and has gone through a very lengthy committee process. It has now come back to the House in its amended form for final conclusion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123433">To recap, members will remember that the act would repeal section 67 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, which excludes Indians who live or work on reserve from filing human rights complaints with the Canadian Human Rights Commission in respect of any alleged human rights violations that relate to any action arising from or pursuant to the Indian Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123434">I want to make it very clear from the outset that this party, this official opposition, has supported the intent of the bill. The repeal of section 67 of the Human Rights Act has been a long time in coming and it is something that we support very much.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123435">What we did not support was the manner in which the bill was brought forward, both in its initial introduction and in its subsequent introduction as Bill <Document DbId="3095171" Type="3">C-21</Document>. It was brought forward without any consultation with first nations communities. We heard that there were significant concerns about the legislation, but there seemed to be absolutely no will, commitment, effort or respect on the part of the government to address some of those concerns. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123436">I am repeating myself, but I want to make it very clear. I said, at least 18 times, in the House or in committee, as did my colleagues, that we supported the repeal of section 67 of the Human Rights Act. We did not support the process in which the government chose, as one of the chiefs from Alberta said, to ram it down their throats. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123437">We are proud to support the amended legislation. We are proud of the process that went on in committee. We heard from a host of witnesses who came before the committee. I emphasize that this is not a substitute for consultation; it was about hearing witnesses and their concerns. Out of the 21 or 22 witnesses we heard, only 1 witness supported the legislation in its original form. We heard learned presentations from academics. We heard from leaders in the aboriginal community. We heard from individuals in the aboriginal community. We heard concerns from the men and women who the bill would affect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123438">We were concerned that there was no interpretive clause. We were concerned that there was no non-derogation clause. We were concerned that there was no attention given to the fiscal capacity. We were most concerned that the transition period was very short. We were also concerned that no study or analysis had been done on the impact the legislation would have on first nations communities. We know an analysis was done on what the impact would be on INAC, but no study was done to determine what the impact would be on first nations communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123439">The amended legislation was a model of cooperation by the opposition parties, listening to the representations we heard from individuals, working together to amend the bill to make it a stronger, fairer bill for aboriginal people in our country.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="50">(1550)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1123440">Many times we heard in the House that we had gutted the bill. Far from it. Misrepresentations were mailed out to every household in my riding, misrepresenting my position and the position of my party as it related to the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123441">We proposed a number of important amendments to the bill. We proposed and passed through committee, a non-derogation clause, an interpretative clause, an extension of the time for implementation for three years. This is important. The government originally proposed six months. It was willing to extend it to 18 months, but not beyond that. I am pleased to see the government has allowed it to go in at three years now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123442">The implementation period of three years will allow first nations to determine their capacity and to look at the implications. It will allow them to prepare their communities for the actual final implementation of the bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123443">As the House may recall, the government tried at one point, through a point of order, to remove the non-derogation clause and the interpretative clause. We are pleased that it has come back with amendments. Although they are not what we would have preferred, we will accept the amended non-derogation and interpretative clauses in the bill. They deal with the intent and the protection of the collective rights of first nations communities. We do, however, prefer the amendments put forward in committee, but as an expression of good faith and a desire to get the bill passed, we will support the amendments put forward by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123444">With the amendments, we would be able to grant human rights to first nations people in a way that balances their collective rights with individual rights as well as maintaining all existing aboriginal and treaty rights, as recognized under section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123445">With respect to the transition period, first nations will now have an adequate amount of time to prepare for the legislation. In doing so, the government will have a chance to properly consult with all affected first nations peoples. I sincerely hope the government will take advantage of the opportunity to do this. I hope it will not just tell them but engage them in a meaningful consultation process whereby it will listen to them and work with them to implement the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123446">Once the bill comes into effect, first nations will work with the government to undertake the extensive preparation, the capacity, fiscal and human resources required. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123447">The important part of this is the amended legislation, and it was amended not without acrimony or without challenge, is an example of parliamentarians working together to fix flawed legislation and amend it to reflect the best interests of first nations people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123448">As I said at the beginning, the Liberals have always maintained our support for the repeal of this section. It was not done in a way which we supported. Since the bill is now in front of us, we are proud to say that we improved flawed legislation to reflect the views of first nations communities throughout the country. They will be able to work with this legislation, and we are proud to support it.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1123449">Mr. Speaker, this is an important day in the House as we bring back the amended Bill <Document DbId="3095171" Type="3">C-21</Document>. Specifically, we are dealing with a couple of amendments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123450"> Unfortunately, this bill has been decades in coming. I will share just a bit of history around this bill. Originally in 1977 an exception was provided that first nations living on reserve could not file complaints under the Canadian Human Rights Act against anything in the Indian Act. Part of the history around that so-called temporary exemption from 1977 being put in place was of course that there were discriminatory provisions in existence in the Indian Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123451">One of those discriminatory provisions was around the fact that first nations women who married non-aboriginal men were actually excluded from living on reserve or maintaining their status. The report that came out in 2005 from the Canadian Human Rights Commission, “A Matter of Rights”, talked about the impacts on the community. I have a quote from that report about what happens to families:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123452">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The effect of this discriminatory provision was the effective banishment of over one hundred thousand women, their spouses, and their children from their communities and traditional homelands. This caused great psychological, emotional and economic suffering. This was especially true in cases where marriages broke down and First Nation women were not allowed to return home.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123453">What we had in place was a system that disenfranchised thousands and thousands of women and their families. Because the department of the day knew this discriminatory provision was in place and was not at that time prepared to deal with that discriminatory provision, it asked for this exemption and it was put in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123454">Subsequent to that, this particular part of the Indian Act was repealed and women were granted their status. I am going to come back to that in a minute, because that was Bill C-31 from 1985, which was one of the reasons that so many people who came before committee were so vocal about wanting some of the amendments that were put in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123455">I am not going to read all the recommendations from “A Matter of Rights”, but there were five key recommendations. Part of what the Canadian Human Rights Commission recommended in 2005, before legislation was developed, was that consultation take place with first nations and that “an interpretive provision”, which would take into consideration the rights and interests of first nations, be put in place, and that there would be a transitional period of at least 18 to 30 months, and so on. There were a number of other recommendations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123456">However, part of the challenge that this House and the committee faced was that when the piece of legislation came before the committee, it was of course a very simple piece of legislation and did not include any of those elements. The bill was developed without consultation with first nations communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123457">Therefore, to the Conservative government's surprise, there were a number of concerns raised by witness after witness who came before the committee. People were saying that in the past governments have passed bills in the House that have had some unintended consequences, and they did not want to see that happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123458">The committee listened quite respectfully to the witnesses and subsequently proposed a number of amendments, which included an extended transitional period for 36 months. They included an interpretive clause and a non-derogation clause. The amendments we are dealing with today have done some refinement on the non-derogation clause and on some additional wording around gender principles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123459">I want to come back for a moment to the Canadian Human Rights Commission and why the committee faced some challenges around needing to hear so much more information, because the report of the Canadian Human Rights Act Review Panel, “Promoting Equality: A New Vision”, made a number of specific recommendations with regard to the repeal of section 67.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123460">The panel said specifically,“Any effort to deal with the section 67 issue must ensure adequate input from Aboriginal people themselves”. We saw what happened when that did not happen: it took months for us to get to the place where there was some agreement in getting the bill back in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123461">The panel talked about resources. To go back to Bill C-31, one thing was very clear in Bill C-31, and in a minute I will quote the Native Women's Association of Canada. What was very clear under Bill C-31 was that there were inadequate resources once women regained their status in their communities. There was not enough housing. There were not enough other support services for women who could have returned to their community. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="00">(1600)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1123462">Therefore, one of the things that the Human Rights Commission recommended was that these resources be put in place. It said that resources must be put in place so that people actually have access to any redress mechanisms that might be deemed suitable once a complaint was filed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123463"> It talked about the fact that there should be cultural recognition and said:</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123469">Thus, the Canadian Human Rights Commission itself acknowledged the fact that there needed to be a number of other mechanisms put in place in order to make sure that this piece of legislation did not have the same kind of impact that Bill <Document DbId="1266940" Type="3">C-31</Document> has had. Bill C-31 has had some difficulties in terms of the fact that when women were reinstated there were not the resources that I referred to, but there is also a second generation cut-off.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123470"> The second generation cut-off means that people whose parents were not both first nations could end up losing their status by the time the second generation is born. That is an unintended consequence. A report did some analysis on key reserves across the country and did some estimates on when the last status person would be born on those reserves. Some would say that quite cynically the government is not dealing with that provision because then first nations people would come under the guidance of the provinces rather than the federal government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1123475">We know that this very important piece of legislation, the repeal of section 67 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, which does provide the right for first nations people on reserve to file complaints under discriminatory provisions under the Indian Act, in itself will not guarantee human rights unless there are resources in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123476">The Native Women's Association of Canada talked about resources around education and housing. We know, of course, that the children from Attawapiskat are here on the Hill today, talking about how their human rights are being violated by the fact that they do not have access to a school. They do not have access to the education that every other Canadian child off reserve expects as a fundamental human right. When Ms. Jacobs from the Native Women's Association of Canada talks about this, she knows full well that many communities simply do not have those resources that would make sure that their human rights were not violated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123477">In a brief that the Native Women's Association put forward to the committee on the repeal of section 67 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, it talked about the fact that governments, both the current Conservative government and previous Liberal government, should not have waited so long, and again quotes the Canadian Human Rights Commission, which said: </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1123482">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to the bill dealing with the European free trade agreement with Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123483">The bill is one that started its progression internationally in 1998 when the then government of Mr. Chrétien moved forward on deliberations with our partners and began dealing with this particular issue. The agreement was signed on January 26, 2008, in Switzerland and it was tabled in our Parliament on February 14, 2008.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123484">The purpose of the bill is to eliminate duties on non-agricultural goods and selected agricultural products, giving Canadian exporters better access to Canada's fifth largest merchandise export destination. Many Canadians would find it interesting that the particular destination is a group of northern European countries, including Liechtenstein and Norway.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123485">This particular free trade agreement is one that has broad support. The Liberal Party supports this particular bill. There are some concerns in a few sectors, including shipbuilding, but I think we have worked together quite well to put forth some solutions that would enable our shipbuilders in Canada to find some recourse because the phase-out of tariffs will be over quite a prolonged period of time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123486">We want to ensure that in Canada we capitalize on our areas of expertise, and one of those is, quite frankly, in the shipbuilding area. On the east coast and west coast of Canada and in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="78343" Type="2">Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca</Affiliation>, we have outstanding individuals, fine craftsmen and craftswomen, who work in the shipbuilding industry and provide exceptional products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123487">Some of those have been built for our Canadian Forces. When Liberals were in government, we commissioned a number of projects, including the Orca class of boats that have been built in my riding of Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca by the shipbuilders there. Quite frankly, the product they have is superb.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123488">My hope is that the government will work with our private sector to ensure that our capabilities will be exported and that those capabilities will find markets in other countries. It would certainly be a fine testament to the exceptional workers that we have in our country, in both eastern and western Canada, who have that ability. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123489">There is one area in shipbuilding in particular that the government may wish to pick up on. We have a tariff on importing ships. A company in Canada that wishes to import a large vessel would pay an import duty. That duty goes into general revenue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123490">The government would be wise to consider, rather than putting those import duties into general revenue, to put them into a fund that would have to be matched by the private sector, which would double the size of the fund, so that those moneys could be directed toward infrastructure for the shipbuilding industry. The funds spent by the companies could then be recirculated within the shipbuilding industry. The private sector would then know that its import tariffs were going back into the shipbuilding industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123491">Third, it would also increase the bang for the buck because the government would be putting those moneys in to match. The matching funds would share the responsibility between the private sector and the government, so there would be dual responsibility and a dual opportunity for both the private sector and the government to enable the private sector to compete with other shipbuilders, particularly those in northern Europe, who quite frankly have done a pretty good job of developing a fine product and are competing internationally. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123492">However, those countries subsidize their domestic shipbuilding capabilities, and while they do it in certain ways, it is important that our shipbuilders not be under the gun or behind the eight-ball when they are competing with other shipbuilding companies in other parts of the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123493">The scope of the bill is very interesting. As I said before, the EFTA countries are the world's fourteenth largest merchandising traders and Canada's fifth largest merchandise export destination. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1123494">The two way Canada-EFTA non-agricultural merchandise trade is, in total, $12.6 billion. Our exports to the EFTA were $5.1 billion last year and our imports were $7.4 billion. Our exports included areas such as the aerospace products industry and I want to take a moment to talk about the MacDonald-Detweiler issue when the government, I think wisely, made the decision to prevent that sale from occurring.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123495">There is a challenge, though. While the MDA sale was quite rightly blocked because Canada and Canadian taxpayers had put more than $500 million into enabling MDA to be a world leader in the aerospace industry and paid for satellites that are some of the best in terms of earth monitoring capabilities, there is another side to this. There are over 1,200 scientists at MDA and unless they have products to sell and be competitive internationally, we will lose those scientists.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123496">It took some 20 years to bring those scientists to Canada and to build and create the capabilities. It is of the utmost urgency that the <Affiliation DbId="111555" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> work with and listen to MDA to find ways to ensure that those scientific capabilities stay within Canada. If we do not, the very real danger is that we will lose that world class capability we have within MDA with the pool of 1,200 scientists to other parts of the world. In particular, we will lose them south of the border to the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123497">This is not something we can wait on for a long period of time. This is something that has to be done quite quickly. I would again urge the <Affiliation DbId="111555" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> or industry officials to meet with MDA officials to determine what we can do to ensure we do not have this loss of very highly skilled, extraordinary individuals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123498">The other issue I want to talk about is international trade, as this is a trade issue, dealing with the WTO and the Doha round of talks. This is very appropriate given the fact that we have a world food crisis on our hands. It has caused governments to collapse and food riots, and it particularly affects those citizens of our planet who are the poorest and most impoverished in the world. One billion people live on less than $1 a day and 1.5 billion people live on less than $2 a day. Two and a half billion people on our planet live on less than $2 a day. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123499">What happens if our foodstuffs increase 140% in a matter of less than a few months? That is what happened with rice. This year, rice prices have increased 141%. Wheat, sorghum, corn, the staples of life, have increased significantly over the last two years. Some have even increased 25% in a day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123500">Most of us in our country have been somewhat insulated from the effects of that for various reasons, but for the poorest people in the world, that is not the case. People living on less than $2 a day have a choice between food and sending their children to school, food and having a roof over their heads, or food and health care. Those are the stark choices people would have if they lived in those countries in the world, more than 58, where there is endemic poverty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123501">The food crisis has not hit us yet in terms of prices but it will. When it hits, it is those Canadians who are least able to afford it who are going to be hurt, people who are single parents with very little money, people making minimum wage or a bit above it, and seniors on fixed incomes who live hand to mouth. The implications of this are quite significant. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123502">What if people have to make choices within food groups? That is how it happens. As prices increase dramatically, people actually have to jettison vital food groups that are important not only for the health of adults but are critical for the development of children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123503">We know that the deprivation of micronutrients and malnutrition on a developing child is catastrophic. If children are deprived of micronutrients and are malnourished, the developing brain in particular is affected. Malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies create long term cognitive, intellectual and physical disabilities that are permanent. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1123504">Children would grow up to be adults who are less than what they could be. The downstream effects of this are what? The downstream effects are that children who are deprived of micronutrients and are malnourished have long term physical, cognitive and intellectual disabilities that affect them when they are adults. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123505">When they are trying to be employed; go to school; acquire training; live and work; act, behave and interact; all of those are negatively impeded by virtue of the fact of what happened when those individuals were children. Early deprivation has long term, profound implications not only for the individual but for society as a whole. The tragedy of it is that it is entirely preventable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123506">When we know that, it behooves us to start to tackle this issue in a pragmatic way. Let us talk about some of the antecedents as to why the food crisis is taking place. Demand, to be sure, is going up in countries such as India and China, pushing prices up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123507">Second, there is the issue of higher energy costs. Energy is required to produce fertilizers. Seeds are becoming more expensive. Availability is down. Biofuel, the conversion of foodstuffs such as corn into ethanol, which is put in our gas tanks, is also a driver to move prices up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123508">The last and the most pernicious area is the area of trade barriers. There is something we could do that would dramatically ameliorate the effects of food prices and that is the tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade that are dramatically impeding our ability to be able to produce the food that we require.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123509">Imagine that the Doha round and WTO has ground to a halt. It started in 2001, I believe, and it has been sitting there moribund or endlessly going around in one big circle. The countries that are most responsible for this are those that are the richest. The countries that pay the price are those that are the poorest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123510">Imagine that. We have a world food crisis where some of the poorest people in the world are unable to put food on the table and we, as developed countries that are the richest countries in the world, are actually doing things to prevent people who need food, who live on less than $2 a day to feed their children and themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123511">Why has the government not demanded an emergency series of debates at the WTO to move the Doha round forward and to implement the Doha round of agreements? This is something that our new Conservative government has fallen flat on, among many other things on the international stage. Why has the government not done this, instead of sitting back? Why has the government not taken a leadership role to address this international challenge?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123512">Canada can do this. We can take a role in mobilizing the more than 27 agencies such as the World Bank, FAO, IFAD, WFP, and WTO. All of those organizations, 27 in total, are tasked with a responsibility to deal with food issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123513">Canada can make a profound impact at the WTO. Canada needs to get our diplomats behind this. There has to be a sense of urgency that has to come from the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office. The Prime Minister has to tell our highly competent diplomats to move this forward and get the job done. They have to get the Doha round of agreements completed and mobilize this with our international colleagues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123514">On the development stage, we have heard very little. In fact, we have heard nothing on this. Moneys were given. A good thing the government did was to not tie the aid and I compliment it for that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123515">The amount of money given by the government was $50 million more than last year, but prices have increased by 40% plus for the demands that the World Food Programme is trying to meet. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123516">We have an increased demand but we also have increased costs. As a result, the amount of money that we are actually putting forward on this is not even able to keep up with the increases in prices. This is something that is unconscionable.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="20">(1620)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1123517">What else can happen? As I said before, some 500 million small landholders live on less than a hectare. About a tonne of foodstuffs, grain and basic products can be derived from a hectare. We know what we could do. Jeffrey Sachs from Columbia University has made some very eloquent interventions. We could double or even triple the output from these small landholders, who are some of the poorest people in the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123518">Imagine if Canada were to tap into some of the extraordinary research available in the International Development Research Centre and other areas in Canada to deal with the issues of better seed quality, better access to fertilizer and markets and better agricultural practices, water security and irrigation techniques. That combination could be used quite significantly to triple the output of foodstuffs from small landholders. What a remarkable thing we could do if Canada were to take up that leadership role. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123519">I would be remiss if I did not draw attention to two areas of excellence within CIDA. One is the micronutrient initiative in which Canada plays a leadership role. I urge the government to work with the <Affiliation DbId="111559" Type="4">Minister of International Cooperation</Affiliation> and other partners to support this initiative because micronutrient deficiencies have a profound impact on developing children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123520">CIDA has discovered high protein, high caloric, high energy bars. The government could work in this area as well because these bars would be effective during a food crisis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123521">I also want to talk about food security and, in particular, the fisheries issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123522">A good chunk of the world relies on fish for food because it is an important source of protein. Ninety per cent of world fish species have been removed from the oceans, particularly large fish species like tuna and shark. This is a catastrophe. Our oceans are dying. Dr. Sylvia Earle from Woods Hole in Massachusetts has done an excellent job of articulating this. She calls it the dying oceans. Why is the government not dealing with this catastrophe? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123523">I will give the House an example. As draggers fish, they destroy the beds upon which fish reproduce. Draggers are horrible, destructive elements in fishing and they are creating an environmental catastrophe. If Canada were to work with our partners to ban dragging, that would go some way toward addressing the problem of our dying oceans. The reason I mention this is because this is part of international trade agreements and trade negotiations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123524">We have heard nothing from the government on all these issues. We have given the government a number of constructive solutions on which it could act. It could act on the food crisis. It could act through international development and trade. The government could ensure that Canadians are not going to be affected by the storms that are wafting over the world right now. So far we have been somewhat protected, but that is not going to exist much longer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123525">These are big international issues that demand international action. Our country can act with authority and knowledge. I implore the government to demonstrate some leadership and do this for our citizens and for the world.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1123526">Mr. Speaker, I am glad the member has spoken to the European Free Trade Association agreement with Canada. As he is well aware, it is an agreement between the Government of Canada and EFTA, which is a bloc of four countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, to implement a bilateral trade agreement between us and those four countries. It is a bloc of countries that is made up of about 12 million citizens. It is a good trade deal because it is a free trade deal with countries that have similar or even higher labour and environmental standards as compared to Canada's. It is a step in the right direction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123527"> I note that this is in Europe. The big trading bloc in Europe is the European Union, an area of about 27 countries and close to 500 million citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123528">What does the member think the Government of Canada needs to do in order to conduct a trade agreement with the European Union? The real future opportunity for Canadian trade, for Canadian business and for Canadian society is under a free trade agreement with the wider European Union, as I mentioned before, a trading bloc. It is one of the largest trading blocs in the world, made up of close to half a billion citizens and 27 member states. What does the member think we need to do as a country, as a government, to move that sort of trade deal along now that we have the first building block of a free trade agreement with the EFTA?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1123529">Mr. Speaker, my colleague has hit on a very intriguing challenge for the reasons he has mentioned, in terms of the size of the existing population. He also knows there are enormous barriers within that bloc, particularly in terms of the trade subsidies, the tariff and non-tariff barriers, that exist within the European Union and between the European Union and us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123530"> I submit that there are two channels we could take.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123531"> One is to pursue it through negotiations, but be very certain that our domestic producers will not be harmed. Critical to that and incumbent upon the European Union is to remove the tariff and non-tariff barriers that so far have created tremendous price distorting issues, not only in the agricultural sector but also the non-agricultural merchandise sector too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123532">The second channel is we move to the WTO. The member knows I have a particular passion, and I know he does too, in dealing with the Doha round of talks. It is unfathomable I think to most of us to see the intransigence on the part of the Europeans in trying to move forward with something that will help the most impoverished in our world. The failure to complete the Doha round is self-defeating. In the absence of moving through Doha and in the absence of completing these talks, we affect negatively the very security that we are trying to deal with not only in Afghanistan but also in other parts of the world. The failure to complete Doha creates insecurity in some of the most impoverished parts of the world, which ultimately will come to address us in terms of insecurity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123533">I will close by one point. Maybe the area in which we can attract our European friend on this is the issue of immigration to Europe from other parts of the world that are quite poor and the effect that has in its own countries. They are deeply concerned by the immigration issue. If they were able to go and complete Doha, then a lot of the people who would go to their countries, seeking simply a better and more secure life, as any of us would do, would not happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123534">Therefore, the carrot for the European countries would be diminished immigration. A lot of the immigration challenges and racial issues within Europe would be defused. They would also be providing security in areas that have been a source of terrorist activity and insecurity for Europe.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1123549">Mr. Speaker, it is good to get up on Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document>, because it is such a good bill. I think that all members are going to be interested in it. I would encourage all of them, as I said, to support it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123550">I want to mention that the Standing Committee on Natural Resources did a great job in dealing with this bill. There was a very positive study of the bill by the committee and the bill was reported back to this House without amendment. We certainly appreciate the work the members of the committee put into their study of Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123551">Canada's nuclear safety record is second to none in the world. We have a robust technology, we have a well-trained workforce, and we have stringent regulatory requirements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123552">There are two pieces of legislation that provide a solid framework for regulating the industry in Canada. Those are the Nuclear Safety and Control Act and the Nuclear Fuel Waste Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123553">Responsibility for providing an insurance framework, that is, a framework to protect Canadians and to provide stability in this important industry, falls under federal jurisdiction. The Government of Canada has the duty to assume its responsibilities in this area, and through this bill it is doing just that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123554">Canada, like virtually all other nuclear countries, addresses this responsibility with the enactment of special legislation. In Canada, we have put in place the Nuclear Liability Act. That act was passed years ago. Bill C-5 modernizes the Nuclear Liability Act. It does so by doing a number of different things. It brings the compensation levels into line with internationally accepted compensation levels. It expands the categories of compensable damage. It improves the compensation procedures and the way people make claims. It increases the financial liability of nuclear operators.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123555">Up to date rules are needed to provide certainty regarding insurance and legal liability for suppliers, operators and the general public. Without this certainty, Canada would not be able to attract leading international firms and suppliers of technology in the nuclear industry. Of course, it could be argued that Canada's current legislation more or less accomplishes these objectives. Therefore, the question needs to be asked, why do we need new legislation when we already have a serviceable act in place? The simple answer is, as I mentioned, that the current act is outdated. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123556">The Nuclear Liability Act was passed in 1970. In terms of today's nuclear technology, that is the middle ages. Several lifetimes of nuclear and related technologies have come and gone since then. In short, Canada's existing Nuclear Liability Act reflects the technology, the science and the thinking of an earlier period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123557">In the interim, it is not only the technology of nuclear energy that has advanced considerably, but the evolution of jurisprudence has contributed to substantial increases in potential liability. Therefore, the government has made the decision, and Canadians are supporting it, that our legislation must be upgraded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123558">There are, of course, certain fundamental principles of the 1970 act that must be retained. These include absolute liability, exclusive liability and mandatory insurance. I would like to take a couple of minutes to explain what those terms mean, because I know everyone in the House is very interested in them and fascinated by them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123559">Absolute liability means that the operator of a nuclear facility will be held liable for compensating victims in the rare case of a nuclear incident. This means that victims would not have to negotiate with a highly complex industry in order to determine who is at fault. There would be no question of where to take a claim for compensation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123560">A second and related principle, exclusive liability, means that no other party other than the operator, for example, no supplier or subcontractor, would be held liable. This removes the risk that would deter secondary enterprises from becoming involved in nuclear projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123561">To modernize our liability scheme, we must have legislation that goes farther, although retaining certain fundamental principles. That is what Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document> does.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123562">The proposed legislation increases the limit of liability for nuclear operators. The current liability act sets the maximum at $75 million. That amount was substantial when it was set, but now stands as one of the lowest limits among the G-8 group of nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123563">The proposed legislation reflects the conditions of today by raising that limit to $650 million. This balances the need for operators to provide adequate compensation without burdening them with huge costs for unrealistic insurance amounts, or impossible insurance amounts, for events that are highly unlikely to occur in this country. Moreover, this increase puts Canada on a par with most western nuclear countries. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1123564">Bill C-5 also increases the mandatory insurance that operators must carry by almost ninefold. It permits operators to cover half of their liability with forms of financial security other than insurance. This has been an important provision for the industry. These could, for example, be things like letters of credit, self-insurance, and provincial, or in the case of Atomic Energy of Canada, federal guarantees. All operators would be required to conform to strict guidelines in this area. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123565">Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document> makes Canada's legislation consistent with international conventions. It does so not only with respect to financial matters, but it also does so with clearer definitions of nuclear damage reflecting today's legal and international nuclear civil liability conventions. These definitions include crucial matters as to what constitutes a nuclear accident, what damages do or do not qualify for compensation, and so on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123566">These enhancements will place Canadian nuclear firms on a level playing field with competitors in other countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123567">Bill C-5 also makes changes to the time period for making claims. Under the act that was passed in 1970, claims had to be brought forward within 10 years of the incident. However, the proposed legislation raises the time limit on compensation for claims to 30 years. Both the earlier Nuclear Liability Act and Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document> provide for an administrative process that will operate faster than the courts in the adjudication. However, the proposed legislation clarifies what the arrangements for the quasi-judicial tribunal must be in order to hear those claims. This new process will ensure that claims are handled both equitably and efficiently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123568">There has been a lot of debate about some of these proposed measures. For example, there has been discussion about how and why the government arrived at the $650 million amount. Questions have been raised as to other international practices and what goes on in other countries. We believe the $650 million liability limit will adequately address any foreseeable incident in a Canadian nuclear power plant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123569">Although the U.S. operator liability is cited as $10 billion Canadian, in practice, individual U.S. operators effectively carry $300 million Canadian in primary insurance coverage. A few countries, namely Germany, Switzerland and Japan, do incorporate unlimited liability to the operator under the provisions of their nuclear civil liability legislation. However, in practice, that liability is always limited to the amount of coverage provided by existing insurance plus the net worth of the operator that is liable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123570">Questions have been raised as to how the $650 million liability limit will stay modern. It is important to note that the $650 million limit set out in Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document> can be increased by regulation, and that limit needs to be reviewed at least every five years. This review will examine changes in the consumer price index and international trends, but will have the flexibility to take into consideration any other criteria that is deemed appropriate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123571">We have made the argument, and Canadians have accepted it, that this is a proper limit in order to ensure that we have the nuclear liability amounts that we need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123572">The challenge for the government in developing this legislation was how to be fair to all stakeholders and to strike an effective balance in the public interest. In developing Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document>, we consulted with nuclear operators, suppliers, insurers, the provinces with nuclear installations, as well as the public. They generally support the changes that I have described.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123573">I know that some nuclear operators may be concerned about cost implications for higher insurance premiums, but they also recognize that the current levels have been outdated. Suppliers welcome the changes as they provide more certainty for the industry. Nuclear insurers appreciate the clarity provided in the new legislation and the resolution of some long-standing issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123574">Provinces with nuclear facilities have been supportive of the proposed revisions to the current legislation. Municipalities that host nuclear facilities have been advocating revisions to the Nuclear Liability Act for some time. They are supportive of the increased levels of operator liability and improved approaches to victim compensation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123575">In short, Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document> was not developed in isolation. The evolution of policy was guided by consultations with key stakeholders and by experiences gained in other countries. The reality is that we have general support of the industry at large for Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document>. I would urge the members of the House to join in that consensus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123576">To conclude, Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document> establishes the compensation and civil liability regime to address damages resulting from radiation in the unlikely event of a radioactive release from a Canadian nuclear installation. It ensures that a proper compensation program is in place and channels civil liability to operators.</ParaText>

I think we will hear that from other members who will speak to this bill, who were at committee and understand that issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123581">I should explain the oversight mechanism as it is at present. Clearly, AECL has been the provider of the nuclear technology in this country for a number of years. We have initiated a review of AECL to determine what its role should be in the future. Apart from that, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission provides the oversight of the safety of nuclear installations in this country. We have confidence that the commission can do that and it has been tasked with that job.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1123583">Mr. Speaker, I have a question about the liability the Government of Canada may have with respect to its involvement in the nuclear industry. I am not sure if the member can answer the question, but I will ask it anyway. There are two incidents that I will point out on which I think we have had liabilities or currently have liabilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123584">I wonder to what extent this piece of legislation restricts the federal government's liability with respect to the nuclear industry. In the summer of 2005, the government of the day transferred $2.3 billion from the Government of Canada to its crown corporation, AECL, in order to recapitalize the corporation with respect to its liabilities for waste management.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123585">Another liability that comes to mind is the liability associated with the medical isotope reactors that were to be built at Chalk River. That project was recently cancelled. My understanding is that the Government of Canada is partly responsible for the cost overruns and liabilities associated with that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123586">Could the member indicate whether or not this piece of legislation in front of us limits the Government of Canada's liabilities, either with respect to these sorts of incidents or in any other way?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1123588">Clearly, in the development of the bill and the changes to the Nuclear Liability Act, there was an examination of what would happen in the unlikely event there was any sort of an incident in this country. There was a study of what level of compensation needed to be put in place in order to deal with whatever situation might arise. The former amount was $75 million. It was felt that $650 million was a good requirement in order to cover any incident that may occur in this country. That is why that number was picked. It is a practical number which, after studies, debate and discussion about what liability would exist, it was felt would cover more than adequately any event that would take place in this country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1123595">The bill would bring compensation into line with internationally accepted compensation levels. It would expand the categories of things that are compensatory. It would improve the compensation procedures. It puts in a number of procedures that would make it much easier for people to make claims in the event of an incident. It would increase the financial liability of financial operators. On that side, Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document> would put a very strong framework in place for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123596">On the other side, in terms of AECL, this government has provided extra resources to AECL. We have also undertaken a review of AECL and its role in Canada.

Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document>, the nuclear liability bill, is an important bill. It is a culmination of years of examination and review of the old bill and is a concise overhaul of the old bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123609">I want to take this opportunity to echo what the parliamentary secretary said earlier. I want to thank members of the natural resources committee for their diligent work in reviewing the bill, for listening to various stakeholders and for offering constructive discussion throughout our hearings. I also want to thank the officials at Natural Resources Canada for their diligent work and for offering an insightful presentation of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123610">This is an administrative bill that overhauls the 1970 act . It offers new and tighter definitions, clearer objectives, a new liability limit and defines financial security. It also proposes a new tribunal for claims. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123611">We heard throughout our study that Bill C-5 was very much needed for the industry and for Canadians. Nuclear suppliers, host communities, independent professors and stakeholders offered our committee very comprehensive thoughts on the bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123612">While there were many legitimate questions about what the limit should be, what type of financial security there should be and how the tribunal should be structured, the overall consensus was that the bill was needed. Host communities, industry and many Canadians are waiting for it. We will be supporting the bill as presented to the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123613">However, I cannot miss the opportunity to speak about the nuclear energy situation in our country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123614">Earlier this year we witnessed a lot of issues with respect to Atomic Energy and the government's management of AECL. We had a national health crisis when the NRU reactor at Chalk River was shut down because of a licensing issue. As a result, we had a severe shortage of nuclear isotopes. Many Canadians, in fact many citizens around the world who depend on the supply of isotopes, were left scrambling for alternative medicine. Some people had their appointments or examinations delayed. I remember the minister at the time saying that many lives were at stake, and I agreed with his comments. Many lives were at stake.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123615">That problem resulted from the Conservative government's mismanagement of the situation. The fiasco was blamed on the Canadian nuclear safety regulator who was doing her job. The government accused her of partisanship. It claimed to consult independent experts, who, by the way, happened to either be a Conservative or a former AECL employee. Rather than address the root cause of the problem, which was the shortage of isotopes, the government placed the blame exclusively on someone else and, in fact, ended up firing her without any justification.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123616">It is important to raise this issue today because we were just reminded of this a week ago when the government again showed its incompetence by announcing that it would stop the MAPLE reactors, which were supposed to replace the old NRU reactor that produces isotopes, without providing Canadians with a plan on how the supply of isotopes will be supplemented.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1123617">In December of last year, Canadians witnessed what could happen if the NRU reactor were to go out of production: severe shortages that could potentially cost Canadian lives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123618">The minister, after hiding for a month and getting training from a media consultant, told Canadians that he had to fire the nuclear regulator because Canadian lives were at stake. Now he has the gall to say that the government will end the project of replacing the NRU reactor and that we should not worry about it because everything is under control. By the way, we do have a 30 year contract to supply isotopes but we will keep the 50-year-old reactor to produce those isotopes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123619">Any reasonable observer can be forgiven for not trusting the government's word on having any sense of reliability or competent management of the situation. If the government had presented a plan at the time of its announcement of shutting down the MAPLE project, it would have been excused for its decision. However, the fact that it has announced that it will no longer pursue the MAPLE reactor but has offered no real plan to supplement the production of isotopes, leaves those questions in the minds of many Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123620">I would not be doing my job here today if I did not ask those questions and raise those points. My Conservative colleagues cannot disagree with me. At the time, supposedly they justified the firing because lives were at stake. Now they cannot claim that there is no risk involved here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123621">There is another issue here. The Conservatives are secretly considering the privatization of AECL but they are not sharing their plans with Canadians. They are not telling us what they are working on. Instead, they want to do the write-off of the MAPLE reactors on the backs of taxpayers so that if they want to privatize it, taxpayers will pay for that write-off.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123622">It is important that the government, the <Affiliation DbId="78751" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> and his parliamentary secretary tell us here today what their plans are for AECL. It is not just important for me. It is important for Canadians. It is important for the Ontario government, which is looking to hire AECL to build a nuclear reactor, but right now the Ontario government is skeptical about the future of AECL because the federal government has said nothing about it. There are jobs at stake and talent at risk. We need to know what the Conservative government plans to do with AECL.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123623">I do not think anybody can attack me for asking these questions. This is my job. This is what Canadians are asking for and the Conservatives are failing Canadians. They are not explaining what they are doing. They are not assuring us that they are worried about nuclear safety. They are not telling us that they concerned about the supply of isotopes. In fact, they are not even telling us what their plan is for the future of nuclear energy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123624">We know that nuclear energy has a bright future, not just in Canada but around the world. We know that AECL has a wealth of talent, people with high degrees of experience and education that have been inventing and creating products unparalleled around the world and they deserve an honest answer from the government. They need to know what the future holds for them. They need to know what the government plans to do. The Conservatives need to do it transparently, apolitically and publicly. They cannot do it in secret.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123625">I want to take this opportunity here today to urge the government to consult publicly and share with us its plans for AECL. Again, future projects depend on it, jobs depend on it and our nuclear energy future depends on it.</ParaText>

In the coming months the government is going to have the results of those reviews and will gladly release them. The member knows these things, but the Canadian public needs to understand that he has been well aware of them as well.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1123631">We know that the government suspended the MAPLE project, but it did not tell us how it is going to secure the supply of isotopes for the next 30 years. We know that the National Bank Financial report is done because the minister told us that in committee, but the government has not shared that with Canadians. We know that the government is planning on some form of privatization, but it is not telling Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1123634"> Today, we are discussing a bill on nuclear responsibility and, in my view, nuclear responsibility cannot be isolated and treated separately from safety. I am concerned, and I share his fears, as do many Quebeckers when we know that the reactor that produces isotopes at the Chalk River laboratory is now 50 years old and that we were counting on MAPLE reactors to produce a new generation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123635"> The initial requirement for the MAPLE reactor project was $140 million. We still do not know how much Quebec and Canadian taxpayers have invested in this project, nor what results it produced because the project was cancelled </ParaText>

Let us for the sake of argument assume that it was the right decision to suspend or cancel the MAPLE project. Let us for the sake of argument say that it was the right decision. However, what is of concern is that the government did not take the time to devise a plan B, to tell us how it is going to maintain the supply of isotopes for the next 30 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123640">AECL has a contract for the next 30 years to supply isotopes. If the government plans to get out of that business, it should be honest and tell Canadians so they know not to expect isotopes from AECL. However, it is not telling us. All it is doing is cancelling the project.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1123641">Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the member for <Affiliation DbId="78902" Type="2">Mississauga—Erindale</Affiliation>. As a member of the committee and as the lead on this issue, his work has been quite stellar and inspirational to all members from all parties in terms of the depth of his knowledge and his ability to get to the point, and make those points objectively and incisively.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123642"> I was also very proud to be a member of the natural resources committee. When we worked through this process, it actually was quite positive. I believe our common goal to protect Canadians and enhance protection on this issue was really foremost in our minds and indeed the world. There is no doubt that when legislation is proposed on nuclear viability, many people are watching to see what our nation is going to do and how effective it will be. When there is a chance to make better legislation, we always hope that it is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123643">What happened during the course of this debate is probably quite strange to many of us because it seems that the government has been reluctant to provide the confidence needed to satisfy Canadians that our reactors are completely safe. I am hoping the reactor isotope scandal has not forced the government to cocoon or muzzle its members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123644"> When the member for <Affiliation DbId="78343" Type="2">Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca</Affiliation> asked if the Canadian public can have the confidence that there is public safety oversight, so that plain and simply we know that our reactors are safe, I believe the response from the government should have been unequivocal, prompt and clear. I certainly believe that the mechanisms, structures and processes for safety are in place, and that the Canadian nuclear industry provides the highest standard of safety. Indeed, it is a selling point for us internationally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123645">I am hoping, as the viewing public watches this debate, that the isotope shortage scandal does not confuse the public in terms of the goals and objectives of this bill. Clearly, the industry needs and wants this. We went through a very long and comprehensive list of witnesses, scientific groups, citizen representatives, environmental organizations, people who understand the industry from many components, and communities which are affected directly. When we make legislation such as this, we want to make sure that people are consulted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123646"> Indeed, on the question of the adequacy of limits, as someone who has a background in commercial insurance, it is always an interesting question about how much insurance could one really have. From a sales standpoint, many people would think that we are always encouraging people to buy more just for its own sake, but eventually we have to get to a point where we can set a limit and feel confident that in the very remotest possibility of an accident that the compensation level would be adequate and that people would be in the situation they were before the accident.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123647">It was a fascinating debate when other components were added: offshore, water transportation, airborne contaminants, and transportation disruptions. My impression from those witnesses observing the legislation, as they compared our proposed legislation to other countries, was that this bill would come out very good compared to much of the rest of the planet where others have actually gone to the stage of providing such liability. After all the intensive questioning it seemed that as we tried to address this, it was to a large extent overshadowed by the isotope shortage issue.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1123648">We on the committee realized that it could have been averted. With proper planning and arrangements internationally with other countries, there would not have been the need for a knee-jerk reaction, which of course disturbs the entire country and everyone feels it was the industry that was at fault as opposed to the government. Was it handled incompetently? It is now pretty obvious. The vast majority of Canadians would agree with that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123649">Were there people making presentations who had a partisan bias? That of course clouded the issue to some extent. As it continues, we know that the isotope issue has to be addressed in a much more open and consultative process. Here we are close to June. We had the hearings in January and the report to Parliament has been delayed through some other work but also because of an extremely long process for a forestry report. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123650">Parliament should have had the report on the isotope issue already. Hopefully there will be enough time to address that and table it in Parliament before the summer adjournment. Otherwise, it appears that the committee may be meeting during the humidity days of July. Can we get to that report in common cause for the common good? I truly hope that all members of the committee are on the same wavelength for that. I am speaking in good faith.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123651">Rainy River, of course, is part of <Affiliation DbId="78979" Type="2">Thunder Bay—Rainy River</Affiliation>. For those who may not be aware, my riding is seven and a half hours long over two time zones. Imagine driving to a community such as that over the Victoria Day weekend and hearing an announcement that there is going to be a shutdown of the program. I ask, as many people do who are tuned in to this, why would the government do it on the Victoria Day weekend? What confidence should I get from this? Is this not strange?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123652">The media reaction, of course, was that it was very shocked. It undermines public faith. When we tell them we are striving to have the highest possible standards for an industry, it certainly gives fuel to critics who may have their own biases about the nuclear industry, so that we actually undermine confidence as opposed to some form of open media or press release at a time when people can respond to it. It is hard to imagine that something would happen at that time of day over that kind of weekend and people would not suspect a hidden agenda.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123653">When Canadians want to know what lies in the future for the nuclear industry, we should be able to overcome unfair reaction. We should be able to debate the entire future of energy, energy supply, energy demand, and how Canadians will meet their needs in the future. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123654">Where does nuclear fit in all of this? In my riding of <Affiliation DbId="78979" Type="2">Thunder Bay—Rainy River</Affiliation>, there are two coal plants. I want to let people know that we want clean coal as an alternative energy. We want to be part of the program for energy where nuclear fits. This is where this bill helps. Do we need a national plan? I believe we do. It is only fair. Canadians need the reassurance. It is needed internationally for our sales of Candu products and it means that not only Canadians but the entire world has to feel confident in us.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1123672">I want to take this opportunity to thank all the members of the committee for their excellent work. Knock wood, all the members in the Standing Committee on Natural Resources work earnestly, professionally and even passionately. We have just concluded a study on forestry during which we discovered the talents, passions and especially the skills of the members of our committee, which enriched our debates.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123673">Unfortunately, in the debate on Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document>, we did not have any specialists in insurance or nuclear liability. We truly had to listen very carefully together to all the witnesses and all the legislative staff who advised us and explained certain things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123674">We also heard from mayors. Those were the testimonies that touched me the most. There is an association that consists of the mayors of all cities that have nuclear power plants, who have joined together to be represented. We heard from one mayor who told us she was truly pleased with the bill, but that she was surprised and even disappointed that the bill allowed for just $650 million in compensation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123675">Perhaps we should remind those watching us on television that the purpose of Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document> is to modernize an existing law that has been obsolete and neglected for over 30 years. The bill is intended to meet international standards on nuclear liability. This bill explains the responsibility of operators regarding nuclear liability, sets compensation at a maximum of $650 million, and creates a tribunal to hear claims in the event of a nuclear incident.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123676">After much debate, everyone agrees that $650 million is a clear improvement over the current provisions. With the resurgence of nuclear power, we all agree that $75 million was not enough. Nonetheless, some concerns remain. We are reassured by the fact that the minister or the government will be able, every five years, to increase the amount of compensation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123677"> It was pure negligence. For 30 years and from government to government, whether Liberal or Conservative, this legislation and the compensation should have been updated but were completely neglected. It was only recently that they started paying attention on the heels of a recommendation from the Environmental Commissioner who told us in his 2005 report that we had a real problem in Canada because our nuclear liability was not up to the international standards and that it was really starting to be problematic. It was certainly a problem for our citizens and communities, as well as our companies and operators. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123678"> We will support Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document> in order to ensure that our communities have better coverage and better tools to defend themselves in case of nuclear incidents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123679"> We heard some pretty impressive witnesses and got sound advice from all the partners and expert stakeholders. A bill dealing with insurance is necessarily very technical and legalistic and we needed to hear some especially good witnesses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123680"> The only nuclear power plant in Quebec is located near the town of Gentilly and there was an incident here recently that could have been serious, but fortunately was not. That leads me once again to say that if this incident had actually had repercussions, we would have had to rely on this old legislation providing the citizens of Gentilly with only $75 million in compensation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="30">(1730)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1123681"> We must understand that if there had been a very serious incident, there would have been consequences not just for Gentilly but the entire area, the cities and suburbs all around. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123682"> I want to emphasize that we in the Bloc Québécois are not satisfied with the $650 million amount, especially as the bill provides that the amounts will rise from $75 million to $650 million over four years. This will not happen at once and will take four years. To us and our citizens and communities, this may seem a long time, and quite rightly so. The operators also have some fears about the increase in their premiums over such a short time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123683"> We worked very hard on this bill in committee and discussed the issues using all the procedures that the House provides us to really get a handle on it. We can be proud of what we accomplished. We worked in an atmosphere in which we all focused on the task at hand and the positive effects rather than partisan politics. There is still no doubt, though, that there are problems with the entire nuclear issue in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123684">I made a short list of nuclear-related events that occurred in the past year and were of concern not only to the government but to all parliamentarians in this House. You may be surprised by this list.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123685">First, as you know—and I believe the opposition members pointed it out—the isotope shortage and the mismanagement of this crisis by Atomic Energy Canada caused many problems and raised many questions. Although the government may not have said so outright, by initiating a study on what happened between Atomic Energy Canada and the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission it has, in fact, acknowledged that there were serious management and communication problems at play in this crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123686">What we learn from bad experiences helps us to avoid the next crisis. However, when looking at the chronology, it is surprising to note the extent to which Atomic Energy Canada was disorganized. There are questions to be asked.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123687">During this crisis, Ms. Keen, the president of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, was fired. There was also the matter of the current study of Atomic Energy Canada. When he appeared before our committee, the <Affiliation DbId="78751" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> did not hesitate to say that the partial or full privatization of Atomic Energy Canada is among the solutions and recommendations that will very likely be retained. We had our suspicions. He was quite forthcoming, if I remember correctly, when he last appeared.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123688">Furthermore, costs always increase by millions of dollars. As members and party critics for a given file, when analyzing the budgets of each department, we talk in terms of millions of dollars. I have been a member of Parliament for two and a half years. What I have seen, every time, is that millions of dollars are added to the nuclear file, for security, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission or Atomic Energy Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123689">This year, we are talking about $300 million: $80 million to make Chalk River safer and $100 million to further develop the ACR-1000 reactor. We can certainly ask questions, because that is a lot of money. Furthermore, they say nuclear energy is clean energy—I do not agree—but very costly energy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123690">The <Affiliation DbId="78751" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> often tells me that nuclear energy is a provincial option. He knows that I am an MP who keeps a close eye on federal and provincial areas of jurisdiction. There we agree. But nuclear safety and waste management are federal responsibilities. For a year, there has been a lot of spending and a lot of studies, but it is not very clear where the government is headed. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1123691">I am not a strong proponent of nuclear energy, and as a taxpayer, I find it very disturbing to see these millions of dollars going to institutions such as Atomic Energy Canada, even though we do not really know what direction the government wants to take, nor how much money will be needed to achieve the objectives of making Chalk River safer and developing the ACR-1000 reactor. It would be especially important to find out how much we need to invest to upgrade the reactor that produces medical isotopes in Chalk River. As an aside, this reactor is 50 years old and is at the end of its life span. We can modernize it and make all the upgrades we want, but it still has a finite life span.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123692">What solution and plan does the government propose? We recently learned that the government was terminating the MAPLE reactor project. That in itself is not actually news, since it had already been announced on May 16. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123693">We know that taxpayers provided an initial investment of $146 million in this project. Apart from that initial amount, no one really knows how much taxpayers have invested since 1996 in the MAPLE reactor research and development project. We do not know how much it all cost, in the end. We do know, however, that the project was abandoned because it was considered a money pit and it was believed that it could never be completed. We learned this officially on May 16, 2008.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123694">I am personally involved in activities that often bring together major players in nuclear energy. Behind the scenes, everyone knew that MAPLE was doomed to fail and that, clearly, the government failed to realize this fact quickly and in a transparent manner. We are especially concerned about what will replace the reactor that has now reached the end of its existence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123695">To top it off, we learned from the front page of today's <I>La Presse</I> that, through access to information, a journalist was able to get a document produced by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. That document reveals that the commission is worried that it does not have sufficient financial and human resources to fulfill its role and ensure the security of Quebeckers and Canadians, in short, to carry out the mission that is its raison d'être. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123696">This is somewhat surprising, while the current government touts nuclear energy as the solution to environmental problems and greenhouse gas emissions across Canada. In any case, we have a Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission that admits that it does not have sufficient financial and human resources to carry out its mission and guarantee Quebeckers and Canadians that all operators and facilities comply with and meet international safety standards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123697">The document reveals one quite impressive fact, namely, that the commission has had to quadruple its security budget. Indeed, since the events of September 2001, security measures intended to protect the facilities against terrorist attacks—</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1123710">Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak today at second reading of Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document>, introduced by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78536" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123711">As with all private members' bills, the basic goal is always the same—to improve the laws in order to improve the environments in which our constituents live. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123712">In this case, we are talking about Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document>, which would amend the Criminal Code to increase the punishment and impose a minimum punishment for the commission of an offence with a concealed weapon, be it a knife or a firearm. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123713">At the same time, the bill would amend the Criminal Code so that only the actual time spent in pre-trial custody is credited toward a term of imprisonment when the judge hands down the sentence. I will come back to this amendment later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123714">Finally, the bill would amend the Corrections and Conditional Release Act so that victims’ interests are taken into account during the conditional release process. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123715">The bill introduced by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78536" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville</Affiliation> deserves to be studied further because it contains both positive and negative aspects. I will start by presenting the negative aspects of this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123716">First, the bill proposes tougher mandatory minimum sentences for offenders. Here again, we see the Conservative Party's mantra: impose mandatory minimum sentences. The Bloc Québécois does not necessarily support that. That way of thinking is harmful in the sense that there are no identical crimes, just as there are no identical offenders or identical circumstances. As such, minimum sentences can often be detrimental.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123717">This would also have a negative impact on the freedom of the judge who must assess circumstances that differ from case to case. It is important to understand that the context of each crime must be considered in order to hand down an appropriate sentence. Imposing mandatory minimum sentences would needlessly tie judges' hands. When judges sentence an offender to prison, they take into account the offender's degree of responsibility, the seriousness of the offence, and the best way to serve justice while increasing the likelihood of rehabilitation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123718">A closer look reveals that section 90 of the Criminal Code already sets out a maximum 10-year sentence for individuals who commit crimes involving concealed weapons, whether knives or guns. A maximum sentence has been established. Of course, the judge is free to consider the circumstances and the individual's record. In some cases, a minimum sentence may not necessarily be appropriate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123719">Furthermore, heavier minimum sentences do not necessarily dissuade people from committing crimes. Recently, I was saying that would-be offenders decide against committing crimes because of the likelihood of being caught and charged, not because of the sentence they might receive. Also, it is hard to believe that an individual would read the Criminal Code before committing a crime in order to choose a crime that carries a lighter sentence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123720">Once again, prevention is the only proven way to proceed. Quebec is a good example that proves that prevention and rehabilitation produce results: we have a lower crime rate than anywhere else in North America.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123721"> Nonetheless, Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document> includes aspects that merit much more thought in terms of their effects. Incidentally, when we are talking about considering the question of eligibility for parole, the idea that the interests of victims have to be taken into account and forums provided for doing that is not bad in itself. Of course, the principle should be examined together with a number of other factors. Nonetheless, the principle does merit, if not adoption, a thorough examination as part of a more comprehensive study.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123722"> Regarding parole, on June 15 my party made a number of reasonable suggestions about parole to respond to all of the members of the public who would like to have a more balanced system, one that is better suited to the new social reality, that has a real influence on crime, but without the ideological hard line taken by the Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123723"> One of our proposals was to eliminate what is now virtually automatic parole after serving one-sixth of the sentence, to remedy some of the bizarre and most often criticized situations, such as sentences for economic crimes, for example, that result in imprisonment for only a few months.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="20">(1820)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1123724"> Similarly, we proposed that we end the virtually automatic statutory release that occurs after an inmate has served two-thirds of his or her sentence, by instituting a formal assessment of inmates by a professional to determine the overall risk of recidivism that they present for the community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123725"> These are only a few examples among many where the Bloc Québécois has eloquently demonstrated that it is actively responsive to the needs of Quebeckers in relation to the justice system. And this brings me to the second point in Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document> that deserves consideration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123726"> The bill proposes that only time “spent in pre-trial custody is credited toward a term of imprisonment”. To be clear on this, section 719 of the Criminal Code provides that before determining sentence, a judge may deduct two days for each day spent in custody before trial from the final sentence imposed on the offender. It therefore creates a double time phenomenon which, in my view, brings the administration of justice into disrepute. It is also very exasperating for the victims and their families, who sometimes see offenders released within a short time after committing their crimes. At the least, days spent in custody before sentence should still count, but as straight time only.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123727">Thus, Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document> would establish that in all cases, the credit granted would be calculated on the basis of one day of imprisonment for each day spent in pre-trial custody. Furthermore, the credit would not be granted to individuals who are being held by reason of previous convictions or as a result of the review or revocation of an order to release the person.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123728">This is an interesting proposal and one the Bloc Québécois supports. I remind members that this idea was in our constructive approach to justice matters unveiled last year. The people of Quebec know this: we are not a silent opposition. We, the Bloc Québécois, are pragmatic and can keep things in perspective when it comes to introducing good practices in order to fight crime more effectively and ensuring that the public has confidence in their justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123729">In conclusion, in light of the arguments I have presented in this House, Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document> in its current form has some positive aspects and some negative ones. However, minimum penalties and their negative effects that have been discussed many times in connection with previous bills are not the solution to help Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document> meet its objectives. Consequently, like my Bloc colleagues, I will not support the bill of the member for <Affiliation DbId="78536" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123730">Let us be clear. I never once doubted the member's desire to better protect the public. We have all directly or indirectly been witnesses to incidents involving concealed weapons. But as I was saying, there are already provisions in the Criminal Code, and I think we should make more use of them.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1123731">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to offer my comments today in support of Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document>, introduced by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78536" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123732">Like him and many members of this House on both sides, I have serious concerns about the way our criminal justice system is functioning. Like other members, dissatisfaction or perception of general dissatisfaction with the justice system in Canada is a sentiment I hear expressed regularly by my constituents of Westlock—St. Paul.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123733">As we have heard, Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document> contains three general issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123734"> The first deals with sentencing for crimes involving carrying deliberately concealed weapons and homicides committed with a knife in defined circumstances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123735">The second deals with increasing the discretion of the National Parole Board to provide relevant information to victims and to prevent abuse through offender adjournment of parole hearings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123736">The third area, which I wish to address today in greater detail, deals with clarifying the discretion available to sentencing judges in calculating what credit, and indeed what extra credit, should be given to persons who have been denied bail prior to their sentencing. While these are clearly distinct areas of criminal procedure, they have a common feature of dealing with systematic discretion in one fashion or another.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123737">In the imposition of mandatory minimum sentences, the bill clearly is replacing the lower end of the discretionary sentencing range with a minimum sentence. Quite literally, this bill says to sentencing courts that at least a specified custodial sentence must be imposed, and that, of course, is a partial elimination of an existing judicial discretion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123738">There are dozens of like provisions throughout the Criminal Code, so its use is nothing new. However, its application to these offences is new. I should add that the choice of mandatory minimum sentences by Parliament has recently been confirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada in the Ferguson case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123739">In the area of enhancing victim rights, Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document> actually increases the discretionary power of justice system officials responsible for decision making at the National Parole Board. This is an important point to make, as rather than issue a blanket entitlement to any and all offender information, Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document> carefully weaves that outcome into defined relevance and discretion through the parole board.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123740">The third area of the bill deals with what has come to be known as pretrial custody credits. Before analyzing this further, I should point out that this term comes about not as a result of a law passed by Parliament, but instead as a result of the way a discretion bestowed by Parliament has been misused, in my view, by some sentencing judges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123741">In this area, Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document> clarifies how that discretion can be used by providing specific disqualifications based, it is important to note, on existing provisions within the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123742">Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document> clarifies how a vested sentencing discretion is to be used and how it is not. In assessing the impact of this bill, it is wise to start with the specific section it modifies, namely subsection 719(3) of the Criminal Code, which states:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1123744">Four things stand out in this wording. The first is that the court “may”, not must, take pretrial custody into account. I am advised that on some seemingly rare occasions judges have refused to give such credit precisely because of past criminality and breach of existing bail orders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123745">The second is that the time considered is that spent in custody, not on bail under restrictive conditions but in custody.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123746">If there were any doubt about that, judges need only look above subsection 719(3) to subsection 719(2), which expressly says that time spent:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1123748">In other words, what the sentencing judge did in the Moffitt case was contrary to the express provisions of the Criminal Code. Members will be interested to know that this view has been accepted by the Ontario Court of Appeal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123749">The third item that stands out is that the section does not specify any mathematical formula such as the two for one or even three for one calculation currently in vogue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123750">Fourth, and I think most important, is that the section specifies that the time to be considered is time spent “because of the offence”, not “because of breaching previous bail” or “because of a lengthy record” but “because of the offence”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123751">This is consistent with the way our system handles life sentences for persons convicted of murder. Pursuant to section 746 of the Criminal Code, the clock on parole ineligibility starts running from when the person is arrested and held in custody, as used to be almost always the case on murder charges in years gone by.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="30">(1830)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1123752">In other words, if a person is denied bail not because of the offence, but because of the offence and his or her lengthy criminal record or violation of bail, then that person should not qualify for this consideration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123753">In enacting subsection 719(3), Parliament has deliberately expressed the qualification for this benefit, and it is not up to the courts to add to it, especially when the grounds for the denial of bail are themselves expressly stated in the Criminal Code directions to courts about when to deny bail. In plain English, it is called common sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123754">Not only have courts abused this discretion by applying it to the wrong people, they have taken it upon themselves to artificially create “extra” credit based on their view of the nature of the remand facilities. This is where the two for one or three for one calculation comes from.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123755">The irony of the no doubt well-intentioned judicial inmate advocacy has apparently escaped judges who follow this practice. By giving extra credit for remand, they are providing an incentive for people denied bail for past criminality to stay in remand to take advantage of the extra credit. Then they have their lawyers complain about the overcrowding as justification for extra credit. If there was ever an artificial absurdity in dire need of correction by Parliament, this is it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123756">It used to be that in the old days when the career criminals got caught and were denied bail because of their past records, they quit the delaying tactics and pled guilty to what they knew they were going to be convicted of. They did it to avoid what was known as “dead time”. Today, thanks to misguided judicial misuse of a legitimate discretion, that dead time has been converted into the gift that keeps on giving.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123757">Canadians following the debate will be shocked to learn that this abuse of discretion has literally caused their justice system to reward past misbehaviour and violation of bail by giving it extra credit when it comes to sentencing. I know this will come as a shock to those who think complexity is always better, but we need a system that rewards non-offending and compliance with court orders. We need a system that punishes continuing criminality and breach of bail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123758"> Put simply, we need to restore to our justice system the capacity and willingness to tell the difference between right and wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123759">Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document> does exactly that and it will also restore public confidence in our judicial system. Canadians are rightly wary of a justice system that says one thing but does another, and where we have to read the fine print to see what the truth is. Quite frankly, Canadians deserve better than this. It is up to us to make sure they get it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123760">I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate my colleague for <Affiliation DbId="78536" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville</Affiliation> for the hard work and dedication he has put into the creation of the bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123761">As with all legislation, there are some changes we need to look at. If the bill is sent to committee, the committee will study it and will even make the bill better in some cases, but I think it is important to remind all colleagues in the House that we all ran on the idea of fixing our judicial system to make it stronger and better for all Canadians and for future generations.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="78397" Type="2">Mr. Joe Comartin (Windsor—Tecumseh, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1123762">Mr. Speaker, Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document> purports to amend the Criminal Code in several ways and to amend the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, more commonly referred to as the parole act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123763">It has at its base with regard to the Criminal Code amendment the introduction of mandatory minimums, basically when the crime that has been committed involves a concealed weapon. We heard from the member for <Affiliation DbId="78536" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville</Affiliation> about the horrendous experience that he and members of his family experienced as a result of the use of a concealed weapon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123764">It is generally the position of the NDP, policy-wise, that we are not supportive of mandatory minimums. We strongly believe in the use within the judiciary of judicial discretion so that the crime and punishment fit the individual facts, as opposed to applying across the board mandatory minimum sentences and taking away from the judiciary the right to apply appropriate sentences based on the facts that are before them, and as opposed to being compelled to impose a penalty no matter what the facts are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123765">As a political party, we certainly in the past have made exceptions to the rules. We are quite supportive of the use of mandatory minimums in a variety of ways with regard to impaired driving, where in fact their use has been successful. More recently, we have been supportive of the use of mandatory minimums with regard to the use of firearms in the commission of crimes, because in both of those cases we are faced with an epidemic of crime of crisis proportions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123766">We are able to show, perhaps not as fully as we would like, that the use of mandatory minimums, a more severe form of punishment and penalties, is successful when it is targeted and when we are dealing with a crime that is at a particular crisis level. It is effective there. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123767">We are able to show, particularly by looking to the experience in the United States, where the use of mandatory minimums grew out of all proportion, that it did not have any particular impact on the reduction in crime in those states where it was used extensively. In fact, we are seeing a number of state governments in the United States now repealing mandatory minimum sentences because they have been shown not to be at all effective and in fact have been shown to be useless when they are used broadly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123768">To come back to Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document>, I think we all can appreciate and be concerned about the process that the member for <Affiliation DbId="78536" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville</Affiliation> went through and understand his motivation in moving this bill before the House. Unfortunately, that is not the way law should be drafted. In particular, criminal law should not be drafted from that perspective. I do not want that to sound in any way critical of him, but it is simply an observation of the methodology that one should apply when one is creating criminal law. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123769">I do want to be critical of the government and maybe the Conservative Party and its members. The government cannot continue to try to amend the Criminal Code piecemeal. This is another example of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123770"> If the government is really serious about widespread reform as the government sees it, or as changes to the Criminal Code and maybe to the ideology behind the Criminal Code, to the philosophy of sentencing and the philosophy of punishment as the government would see it, then it has to be government policy. We cannot be doing this ad hoc and piecemeal, one section of the code at a time. It is just simply not the way to have a criminal justice system that makes any sense.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="40">(1840)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1123771"> The government is not doing that. I have stood in the House repeatedly over the last couple of years, since the Conservative government has been in place, and criticized it for not doing that. I have implored it, if it is serious about amending the Criminal Code, to do it in an omnibus way and bring in massive legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123772">The code is in terrible shape in many respects. It has contradictions in it. Penalties are too severe in some cases and not severe enough in others, when the crimes are juxtaposed with the resulting range of penalties that can be imposed. It needs to be updated in a number of ways because of the advance of technology. Rather than do this in a way that would be systematic and effective, the government has not done that. It has brought in a series of bills. In addition to that, private members have brought in a series of bills.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123773">I do not have the number, but Parliament, since January of 2006, has to have been faced with at least 50 bills on crime, between the 10 to 20 that the government has brought forward and then at least the 30 to 40 more in the form of private members' bills. It is confusing. It is an erratic way to proceed with reform of our criminal justice system. It is just not the right way to do it, but the government continues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123774">I want to be clear. As individuals, there is always a free vote. However, members of the NDP always discuss it and we have not collectively come to a decision as to whether we will support the bill at second reading and send it to committee or vote against it second reading.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123775">I want to express another concern about the bill. The very first major criminal law bill, an amendment to the Criminal Code, which the government introduced shortly after it was elected, was Bill <Document DbId="2172003" Type="3">C-9</Document>. That was back in the first session of the 39th Parliament. The bill went to the justice committee and was significantly altered in the committee. It dealt with conditional sentences. When it came back to the chamber and was finally passed, it expressed the will of Parliament, the significant majority of parliamentarians who were elected in the last election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123776">We made it very clear to the government that the use of conditional sentences was not to be cut way back as Bill <Document DbId="2172003" Type="3">C-9</Document> originally proposed to do, again leaving to our judiciary the discretion as to when a conditional sentence was appropriate. That message was very clear. My estimation was that perhaps as many as 90% of the crimes that the government wanted to exclude from the purview of conditional sentences were in fact put back in by the justice committee in the amendments and then adopted by Parliament, by the expression of the will of a significant majority of parliamentarians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123777">This bill, and it is just a small part, would preclude the use of conditional sentences by introducing a mandatory minimum in these circumstances. It seems to me the bill is contrary to the intent of the spirit of the vote that we took under Bill <Document DbId="2172003" Type="3">C-9</Document>. I almost question whether the bill should have been allowed to proceed because we had a vote in the House. It was a government bill altered by the opposition parties quite significantly and I believe that vote would have precluded this bill from coming forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123778">I believe it should never should have come forward to the House, given the rules. However, it has and it is before us, but it causes me great concern as to whether we should support the bill, given the vote that has already taken place in the House.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1123779">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to rise to say a few words on Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123780">The bill has three points. It would invoke a mandatory minimum for the commission of a criminal offence with a concealed weapon. It would also amend the Corrections and Conditional Release Act to provide victims and their families more information on release applications. It also seeks to codify the remission for time served. I do not think it is in the Criminal Code now, but a lot of the judges use the two for one formula and this would go one for one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123781">At the outset, although I respect the member for <Affiliation DbId="78536" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville</Affiliation> and I appreciate the work he has put into this and I appreciate his motivations, I cannot support the bill, mainly because of the implementation of the mandatory minimum sentence for this offence. It appeals to certain individuals, but the bottom line is it takes away or it fetters any use of judicial discretion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123782">In any case, coming before a judge, the judge is required to apply the fundamental accepted principles of sentencing, the established ones being retribution, deterrence, possible rehabilitation of the offender, protection of the public, circumstances surrounding the offence, circumstances surrounding the offender and others. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123783">No two cases are alike. A judge could practise for 40 years and he or she would never see two cases that are the same. I had the privilege of practising law for 25 years. I acted both as a part time prosecutor on these cases and as defence counsel. I have looked into the eyes of these individuals. There are no two cases alike.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123784">It has been done in certain cases, but the imposition of a mandatory minimum in offences such as this would, in my opinion, be a step backwards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123785">We are dealing with a first offender, and this again goes back to the fact that no two cases alike. It is perhaps the person's first real run-in with the law. I have seen situations of younger people getting in with the crowd or they are under the influence of drugs and alcohol. The judge has to take into account deterrence, retribution, circumstances of the offender and protection of the public. However, in that case, as in a lot of the cases, rehabilitation of the offender has to be a primary consideration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123786">The circumstances change fundamentally if we are dealing with a person with a record of three or four criminal offences. Then those other principles give way to protection of the public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123787">I do not suggest that sentences be lenient or that there be no sentences. What I am saying is no two cases are the same and we cannot throw out of the back of the truck the fundamental principle of judicial discretion. I am like everyone else in Canada. I see situations. Sometimes I up the paper and read that somebody convicted of an offence, which sounds terrible, and probably is, gets what I consider to be a light sentence. Now that could be one of two situations. The first is that in actual fact the sentence was quite a bit lighter than it should have been, maybe there was an appeal or maybe the judge screwed up. The second, and more likely, is that the media got the facts screwed up totally. It does not describe the offence or the offender, and we are left with an erroneous impression that this has come about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123788">The bill does not take into consideration regional differences. We have the northern communities. We have east and west. Everyone has different crime rates, different causes of crime. This would be an amendment to the Criminal Code and would be binding on all regions in Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="50">(1850)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1123789">The bill does not take into account differences in cultures. We have a situation where people who come from the western province, where you come from, Mr. Speaker, where the first nations population has a certain percentage, but the percentage in prisons is five or six times that. Why is that? Why do we have five or six times the percentage of first nations in our prisons? Is there a reason? Will imposing the mandatory minimum sentence improve that? Everyone knows it will not. What is the cause of this? It is early in the game, but I believe some things such as healing circles and restorative justice are working. Once we pass this legislation, a lot of that may be go out the back door.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123790">I have concern about the whole administration of justice. A lot of these cases are bargained. Literally the system cannot handle the cases before it, but if there is a mandatory minimum, no defence counsel will agree to anything and we will go to trial.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123791">Those are some of the considerations. In principle, it sounds great, but there is fundamentally one problem: it does not work. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123792">The previous speaker talked about the situation in the United States. This was a movement, which started in the United States about 20 years ago, where once it invoked the mandatory minimums, the crime rate would go down and everything would be great. It did not happen. The previous speaker said that some states had repealed their mandatory minimums. I actually know the number of states. Since 2003, 25 states have repealed the legislation dealing with mandatory minimum sentences. That probably represents half of the people living in the United States. The research indicates that it generally does not work. Our southern neighbours are realizing this now and that is why they are repealing it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123793">I make these comments with the greatest respect to the member for <Affiliation DbId="78536" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville</Affiliation> and the motivations behind this draft bill, but I cannot support it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123794"> On the principle of the so-called two for one formula, as far as I am aware, that is not in the Criminal Code now. It is a practice that has developed over the years. It is generally widely accepted. I am not saying I agree or disagree with it because every case should be dealt with on its merits. We had the high profile case of Brenda Martin back from Mexico and there was speculation a judge would be hearing the case in Canada and would give her the so-called two for one credit. Again, it comes back to the judicial discretion in a particular case. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123795">The two for one is not codified now. It is just a rule of thumb. If we had the one for one codified, that would go forward with the actual sentence the judge gave. Every circumstance is different. If people were in jail for protection of the public, that is one situation. However, if they were in jail for two years because they could raise the $20,000 bail, that is an entirely different situation. I would argue in that case probably they should get more credit than one day for one day. Do not forget in that two year period they were in jail because they could not raise the bail, they would not be eligible for parole. If it worked the way it often does, people might be eligible for parole after serving half the sentence, but the two years they were in jail would not apply.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="55">(1855)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1123796">The point is that we will never have two cases that are the same. Each case has to be dealt with on its merits and on the circumstances surrounding the case. In a situation like this where we are trying to invoke mandatory minimums, I suggest it is a step backward.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1123798">Mr. Speaker, I rise with great pleasure to speak in support of Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document> introduced by my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78536" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123799">Like the member for <Affiliation DbId="78536" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville</Affiliation> and others who speak in support of the bill, working to improve the operation of the criminal justice system in Canada is a priority for me as well, not just on behalf of the country, but in particular on behalf of my constituents in Cambridge and North Dumfries. I know that this is also the case for many members of this government, apparently not all members of the House, but perhaps we can discuss this as parliamentarians do and convince the Liberal members who are opposing the bill of their wrongful ways.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123800">I want also to echo remarks that have been made in debating these matters. What I seek is to genuinely improve the justice system. Even though we may have disagreements on how to do that, I am encouraged that perhaps if members opposite listened and paid attention they may actually agree that we need to change some of the things that we have done in the past.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123801">I think all of us will agree, however, that in considering changes, we are well served by ensuring that we know the facts of what we intend to do, the facts behind the issue and the consequences of any changes that we might wish to make.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123802">This is second reading debate of this bill. I am encouraged that the committee, which will seek information from witnesses and experts, potentially offering some amendments is exactly the right thing to do and exactly why the bill needs to be supported. Further, it seems to me that the best legislation is usually as a result of having a clear understanding of why we seek to do what it is that we are seeking to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123803">Finally, I am sure members will agree that the justice system is one that inherently relies on public confidence, and that is a key word these days, and that it and the Canadians it is designed to serve are entitled to a system, not entitled as parliamentarians to their entitlements, but as Canadian citizens they are entitled to a system that avoids artificiality, speaks the truth in what it does and recognizes the difference between right and wrong in how it makes those decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123804">These observations may seem self-evident, but as many of us are familiar with a justice system or who have listened to the descriptions of the proceedings in the Moffitt case, the terrible case that caused my colleague to present this bill to the House, it is true that it is not always the case that these observations are in fact self-evident.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123805">Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document> deals with three areas of criminal procedures. These include the exercise of discretion in determining pretrial custody credits and enhancing victim interaction in the parole process. There cannot be anything wrong with those two. The third is in the area of establishing mandatory minimum sentences for crimes involving weapons and specifically those involving knives. Other members may wish to speak to the first two subject areas I mentioned, but I just wanted to indicate that I support those areas and what I would like to do in my time allocated is focus my remarks on the mandatory minimum sentencing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123806">As members have heard, there is a regrettable but undeniable growth in the number and seriousness of violent crimes committed with knives in Canada. Today I looked up statistics for my own region of Waterloo. I do know the member for <Affiliation DbId="78602" Type="2">Kitchener--Waterloo</Affiliation> has suggested there is no problem with crime in that region, but if he checked the statistics he would see that other violent crimes are up 28%. Offensive weapons have gone from 427 cases in 2005 to 535 cases in the next year. That is about a 20% increase. We cannot stand back and do nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123807">As it frequently is the case in dealing with criminal justice reform, there is not necessarily a single answer, but instead a response that covers the spectrum of principles that underlie our justice system.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="00">(1900)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1123808">Certainly measures that attempt to prevent people from engaging in criminally carrying knives or in stopping such behaviour is part of that solution. The bad guys have to know that if they are going to do serious crimes, they will do serious time. At this stage of the bill we can leave the balance to the experts at committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123809">The point of Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document> which I completely support is that for some people the knowledge of a certain and unpleasant consequence does work as a deterrent. This is the root of mandatory minimum sentencing. It is, as members know, a long-standing part of our justice system. This kind of stuff already exists. I might point out that the Supreme Court has just upheld that it is in fact constitutionally valid.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123810">In fact, let me quote from that case where Chief Justice McLachlin, speaking for a unanimous court, rejected the idea that there could be an exemption to what Parliament enacted as a four year mandatory minimum sentence for causing death with a firearm, which is the same one as proposed in Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document>. She said:</ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">In granting a constitutional exemption, a judge would be undermining Parliament’s purpose in passing the legislation: to remove judicial discretion and to send a clear and unequivocal message to potential offenders that if they commit a certain offence, or commit it in a certain way, they will receive a sentence equal to or exceeding the mandatory minimum specified by Parliament. The discretion that a constitutional exemption would confer on judges would violate the letter of the law and undermine the message that animates it.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123812">If any of my colleagues want to look that up, that is from R. v. Ferguson , paragraph 55. I selected this quote simply to remind members of two things: one, this type of thing already exists in the Criminal Code; and two, it is constitutionally valid.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123813">The point behind mandatory minimums is not simply to cause courts to sentence more severely but, as the member opposite just said, to actually contribute to there being less need in the long term for courts to sentence because at least some people would be getting the message. It is not a total solution, but it is part of the solution. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123814">One of the mandatory minimum sentences proposed simply adds homicides committed with a knife to section 236, which already requires such sentencing, as I have stated, for homicides committed with a firearm.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123815">Given the disturbing reality of knife homicides actually now outnumbering firearm homicides, I trust that members will come to their senses and all members will support this bill at second reading.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123816">Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document> creates a new mandatory minimum sentence with escalating time for repeat offenders for persons convicted of criminally possessing a concealed weapon, which includes a knife. This does not create any new kind of criminal liability for someone in lawful possession of a knife. It does, however, do several important things. It creates a mandatory minimum custodial sentence of 90 days' incarceration with a minimum one year sentence for subsequent offences. This is a clear and unequivocal expression of Parliament that a dangerous behaviour that too frequently and increasingly frequently leads to deaths like that of Andy Moffitt is unacceptable and Canadians deserve better care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123817">I want to conclude by saying that anyone who practises criminal law will attest that such actions as increasing maximum sentences that we have seen from the previous government are literally useless. It does not mean anything simply because the courts virtually cannot ever hand out maximums.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1123824">There are reasons for legislation to come forward. This is an example where a member of Parliament, through a cause in his community or a cause on behalf of people he knows, has developed legislation that would actually work for victims and the victims' families. That is an important part of our job as members of Parliament and as makers of the laws of Canada. People's experiences, and not always good experiences, give them the ability to communicate and work with members of Parliament on these types of bills and allows these types of discussions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123825">I support the bill at second reading and support the idea of moving the bill to committee so we can have more discussion. People in other organizations have lots of concerns about some parts of the bill. That is why it should go to committee. It can be worked on there and people can bring their own experiences to committee and offer changes that may or may not be needed. I will certainly be following this very closely.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123826">As many people have said, the bill proposes to create new mandatory minimum sentences of imprisonment for carrying a concealed weapon, as well as for manslaughter committed with a concealed knife against an unarmed victim.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123827">When people are awaiting their trial and sentencing there is sometimes a trade-off in days spent and three days may be traded for one. That is not what Canadians want. People have told me time and time again that this is not what they want, and the member has addressed this issue in his bill. Canadians want people to be accountable for their actions and to be responsible to the public. It is our job as legislators to develop laws that protect the victims and their families. Often friends in my community tell me that they have a real problem with people being kicked back into the community, barely having served any time, and not accepting full responsibility for, or understanding the implications of, their actions.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1123831">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank all members for participating in the debate and for their consideration of the important issues contained in Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document>. Its goals are straightforward and they deserve our support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123832">The bill will break the escalation of violent knife crimes by applying deterrent measures, including for the act of criminally carrying a concealed weapon. It will end the abuse of judicial discretion that results in career criminals and bail violators being rewarded at sentencing and ensure crime victims are kept properly informed and not subjected to procedural abuse in their interaction with the National Parole Board.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123833">These measures are intended to deal with systematic issues that are not theoretical or ideological. Their origin comes from the current realities of crime and the justice system in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123834">When the bill was debated on April 11, I was surprised to hear some members opposite suggest that it was the response to a single case. In fairness, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78519" Type="2">Burnaby—Douglas</Affiliation> did ask if there were other examples, and while I mentioned some in general terms during my original remarks, let me now provide greater details.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123835">Members no doubt took note of the recent release of the youth crime stats which reported that youth homicide rates have risen 41% since 1997. About 44% of homicides committed by youth involved a knife, while 17% involved a firearm. Violent crime has risen 30% since 1991.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123836">In preparation for this debate, my office did by no means a complete media scan. We started back on October 24, 2007, and ended just the other day on May 25. I have assembled clippings, and I stress that they are not complete, but we have recorded 170 stabbings or robberies with a knife and 44 separate homicides with a knife. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123837">To be more precise, since our last debate on the bill on April 11, we have noted 45 stabbings and 14 knife homicides in just six weeks. These incidents involved swarmings, home invasions, robberies and assaults, and fights tragically escalated through the use of a previously concealed knife.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123838">There are other systematic factors involved in at least some of the cases, but having the House send a deterrent message, a preventive message such as recognized recently by the Supreme Court of Canada, is a positive step to make this country a safer place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123839">The same clipping survey details cases of violent offenders, who were denied bail because of their past criminal records, being rewarded with not only credit for the time they earned in precustody but with double and in one case even triple credit for their ongoing criminality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123840">In one case extra credit was awarded for a vicious knife attack, even though the offender had his bail revoked when he was charged with being an accessory to murder while on bail for the stabbing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123841">The law does not require such credit, but I would suggest that the law needs to be changed to prohibit in these narrowly defined circumstances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123842">My background is not in criminal law, but working on the bill has shown me that we need more than just a legal system with rules to be followed without question. We need a justice system where those rules actually support the principles of justice, like past misconduct not being rewarded when it is followed by continuing criminality or consequences for breaching court orders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123843">Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document> is limited in scope and in purpose. I welcome suggestions about how it could be improved to achieve its goals. I have already received several constructive wording suggestions which I think will do exactly that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123844">This is the rationale and mandate of our committee system. I urge members to vote to send the bill to committee so we can do the work that we do best.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123845">The bill has received public support from the Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime and from Commissioner Julian Fantino of the Ontario Provincial Police. Let me quote from his remarks, “It is a regrettable but undeniable reality that the carrying of criminally concealed knives and violent knife crime itself has increased dramatically in Canada recently, with all too often deadly consequences. I am confident that your bill will prove to be a deterrent to such actions for some offenders”. He also said, “I am very pleased to see that Bill C-393 also addresses a development of sentence calculation which has crept into our justice system”. He has offered to appear at committee.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1123846">Finally, I recently spoke with the Moffitt family who are visiting Ottawa again today to let them know what was going on with the bill and to update them about the bill. I was again overwhelmed with the quiet dignity of this family who wanted to know how they could help make these improvements a reality. Mrs. Moffitt summed up all the deficiencies that her family had to encounter over the years when she said, “tell them we can do better than this”. She is right. We can do better and now is our chance to do so in these specific areas.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1123859">Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to follow up on a question I asked the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> last March regarding the loss of jobs in the manufacturing and auto sectors, and why he continues to attack the province of Ontario. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123860">Canadians and historians were baffled when the federal <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> held an unprecedented press conference and attacked the Ontario provincial budget the night before it was delivered at Queen's Park. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123861">Nowhere before in Canadian history has a federal finance minister deliberately attempted to sabotage a provincial budget and in doing so, cost the people of Ontario precious jobs at a time when our manufacturing and auto sectors are suffering dearly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123862">As a matter of fact, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> was quoted as saying that Ontario was the “last place” to do business in North America. How can a federal <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> be so irresponsible? The minister should be aware that business leaders and financial sectors take his word very seriously. His comments are damaging to Ontarians and Ontarians are perturbed, especially as the minister is from Ontario, and was responsible for decimating Ontario's financial health and leaving Ontario with a $5.6 billion deficit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123863">The province of Ontario has done a great deal after that to attract investment. The premier of Ontario has cut corporate taxes by $3 billion and last December eliminated its capital tax on resource-based industries, including manufacturers. The province of Ontario continues to phase out capital tax altogether and is reducing property taxes to help small and medium sized businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123864">I am aware that the member opposite already has a prepared speech that will no doubt heap considerable praise on the Conservatives for cutting taxes. The fact of the matter is that virtually every leading economist in the country has warned the Conservatives that cuts to the GST are the wrong way to go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123865">In fact, an access to information request revealed that the government's own Department of Industry told the Conservatives that a 1% cut to the GST will only generate a 10% return in economic improvement compared to a 30% return by just a $1 reduction in personal income taxes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123866">Previous Liberal governments delivered substantial personal income tax cuts precisely because they put money back in the pockets of taxpayers. Cuts to consumption taxes such as the GST do little for those who have little or no income. The Conservatives should know this and that their message is not appealing to the average taxpayer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123867">Recent polls reveal that 80% of Canadians have not noticed any improvement in their family budget, a stunning revelation considering that the poll was taken just weeks after people received their much vaunted Conservative tax refunds. In fact, 28% of those surveyed say their personal finances are in worse shape now than at any time over the past year. That is a 75% increase since last fall.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123868">The reason for this attitude is because all of the puny tax cuts from the Conservatives have been swallowed up by skyrocketing fuel prices. How has the government responded? By doing nothing. In fact, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has told Canadians that he will do nothing to ease the price of fuel even for seniors on a limited income. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1123890">Mr. Speaker, on April 3, I asked several questions of the government about the amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act contained in Bill <Document DbId="3354384" Type="3">C-50</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123891">Instead of answering my questions, the minister started a taxpayer funded advertising campaign in ethnic media across the country to convince immigrant communities that, despite all evidence, they can trust the government with the future of Canada's immigration policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123892">In addition, the <I>Globe and Mail</I> reported yesterday that the minister secretly used Toronto city hall meeting rooms to promote the Conservative Party's views on the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and Bill <Document DbId="3354384" Type="3">C-50</Document> to ethnic media outlets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123893">This is despite the minister's rejection of Toronto Mayor David Miller's requests for a consultation on the proposed changes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123894">Mayor Miller is not the only one who is not being fully consulted. The speed at which these amendments have been pushed through the House and its committees shows the government's lack of respect for the opposition and parliamentary procedure. Given the potential impact of the bill on the future of Canada, the government owes it to Canadians to remove the immigration provisions from Bill <Document DbId="3354384" Type="3">C-50</Document> and propose them as separate legislation. Changes of this scale should not be just an afterthought in a budget bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123895">The minister has also refused to tell Canadians who she would fast-track and who she would leave behind under the new regulations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123896">This is not a surprise. It would be nearly impossible to sell Bill <Document DbId="3354384" Type="3">C-50</Document> if the minister admitted that she plans to put a cap on family class applications, which she has refused to rule out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123897">One idea that has the support of many in the immigrant community is my proposal of a visa bond system. Under a bond system, immigration officers could give applicants or sponsors the chance to provide a financial guarantee in borderline visitor visa cases. This would help many applicants wanting to come to Canada for weddings and funerals to avoid the rejection and emotional distress they face under the current system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123898">Canada's visitor visa process is unfair and discriminatory, especially for applicants from developing countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123899">The amendments in Bill <Document DbId="3354384" Type="3">C-50</Document> would do nothing to improve the situation for visitor visa applicants and, as such, would not truly fix Canada's immigration system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123900">The government has attached its immigration proposals to a budget bill and tried to force them through the committee and the House without making amendments and used tax dollars to sell its plan to immigrant communities. These are the actions of a government that knows its views on immigration are at odds with those of the majority of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123901">I again ask the government why it is sneaking these reforms in through a budget bill, instead of allowing the House to have an independent debate on this critical issue.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1123902">Mr. Speaker, to reply to some of the remarks made by the hon. member, it is obviously important to communicate the intention of the budget bill that relates to Citizenship and Immigration because it will affect a number of members of the ethnic community and it is important to meet with them and to ensure they are aware of what we are proposing. That is what has been done. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123903">The intention with Bill <Document DbId="3354384" Type="3">C-50</Document> is to take care of the backlog that grew under the member's government over the past number of years from 50,000 to over 800,000, and continues to grow. No one is served by the fact that we are simply taking in more and more applications. The bill would stop the backlog from growing and then would address the backlog to ensure families are reunited faster, skilled workers are brought in from every country and race, to ensure that those skills that are required in the community are met by those who have the skills, and to ensure that is done fairly quickly, not over a period of six years, but in a period of months. It is important for the bill to go forward so that can happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123904">The bill would also ensure dollars are invested to reduce the backlog in a proper fashion. It will not be discriminatory in any way with respect to race, religion or ethnicity. It will be charter compliant and dealt with on an objective basis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123905">Our party is proud of the fact that we have many members of ethnic communities in our party. We were the first party to have a Muslim elected to Parliament, the current member for <Affiliation DbId="78487" Type="2">Edmonton—Strathcona</Affiliation>; the first Japanese Canadian to become a cabinet minister, our <Affiliation DbId="111559" Type="4">Minister of International Cooperation</Affiliation>; the first Chinese Canadian MP; the first Hindu MP; the first of two Indo-Canadian women, the member in our party for <Affiliation DbId="78863" Type="2">Fleetwood—Port Kells</Affiliation>; and, the first black MP and minister of the Crown. Under the previous Clark government, there was a generous response whereby 77,000 Indo-Chinese refugees entered Canada between the years 1975-81 and, of course, Prime Minister Mulroney introduced the first Multiculturalism Act in 1988.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123906">We have opened our arms and doors to invite people from various cultures and countries to come into our country but the immigration system has been burgeoning and has not been proceeding as efficiently as it should. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123907">Also under the previous government, in which the member was a part of, settlement funding was literally frozen for over a period of 10 years. People were coming in but they were not given the support or language training they needed to become integrated as quickly as possible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123908">Under previous budgets, the government allocated $1.4 billion over five years to directly address settlement issues and to ensure that those who came here would succeed. We also reduced the head tax on newcomers by cutting it in half in the previous budget. In the new budget, we have allocated $109 million over five years to ensure efficiency is built into the system and that it works the way it was intended. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123909">My sense is that we will have more newcomers joining us quicker, more being reunited with their families quicker and more becoming successful citizens faster.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1123913">Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to hear the rhetoric of the member and other members of the Liberal Party saying that they oppose the concept of Bill <Document DbId="3354384" Type="3">C-50</Document> and the immigration portion that would reform the immigration system so it works better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123914"> However, despite the rhetoric, I appreciate the fact that the Liberals supported us at the finance committee to ensure the bill comes back to the House for a vote, and again today in the main estimates and supplementary estimates, they concurred in approving the injection of additional funds, part of the $109 million that was in the estimates and supplementary estimates, to ensure that goes forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123915">They are talking one way in the House with respect to this issue and voting another way to ensure that the bill receives passage. I thank them for that because the bill does need to go forward to address, not only the continuing growth in the backlog that ballooned from 50,000 to over 800,000 under that member and his government's term in office. It needs to be addressed now.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1123916">Mr. Speaker, the media whirlwind being what it is, the world food crisis lost its spot on the front page some time ago to other news. Do not forget that the cost of basic foods has gone up 48% since the end of 2006. According to the director of the World Food Programme, a “silent tsunami” is threatening to plunge 100 million people into hunger. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123917">The government announced $50 million in additional support for the World Food Programme and then let things run their course, believing that it had done enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123918">It put a band-aid on a gaping wound, so to speak, and did nothing to address the root of the problem. Speculation, the use of food sources to produce biofuels, and our irresponsible energy consumption have contributed to the world food crisis, and we know it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123919">The government must commit to dedicating 0.7% of its GDP to international aid, as it is supposed to. At least it has untied its aid, but we must first and foremost help populations in crisis to produce their own food.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123920">We all know the proverb “Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.” In international aid terms, this means: build supply roads so that village crops can get to the cities in developing countries; stop promoting within international organizations the massive cultivation of export crops, which in the end only ruins farmers who adopt the practice and starves the population—in other words, to a certain point, the food sovereignty of developing countries must be respected; immediately stop subsidizing the production of biofuels that directly use food crops—here, the grains in question—to produce ethanol, which causes prices to rise and diverts precious resources to fuel our cars instead of feeding people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123921">Given the scope of the crisis and the absence of a successful conclusion without a drastic change in energy policies and international aid policies, a number of major players are calling for significant changes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123922">The director of the IMF, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, sounded the alarm by saying that the current food crisis could lead to war and uprisings. The IMF also estimates that 70% of the rise in the price of corn is because of the use of biofuels and the subsidies granted to biofuel producers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1123941">What will this do? Canadian food aid partners can now purchase commodities internationally with a special emphasis on procurement from developing countries. This will help reduce food and transportation costs and speed delivery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1123942">In the long run, actions like this will go a long way to helping the poor underdeveloped countries in bringing their own capacity up when their hands are not tied. We are hoping that this kind of action by other countries will lead to what she is concerned about and what we are concerned about: the rising food costs in the world.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1123954">As the member knows from my responses to his questions some weeks ago in committee, which I will repeat here in case he has forgotten, when I learned of this we immediately implemented an action plan. That plan involved reviewing all of the contracts and then ensuring that in the future all of the contracts for exempt staff would be referred to the department for comments, and that any comments from the department to my staff, including my chief of staff, would be referred to me. That action plan has been followed.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1124044">In particular, budget 2008 proposes to establish a tax-free savings account, extend assistance for Canada's manufacturing sector, improve the scientific research and experimental development tax incentive credit, while increasing in the future funding for people, knowledge, business, innovation, communities, traditional industries and infrastructure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124045">We are also making the largest federal public infrastructure investment since World War II, over $33 billion in our building Canada plan. In addition, we have created the office of P3 Canada, which will help to lever that money with the provinces and the private sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124046">With municipalities in Canada, we made the gas tax permanent for municipalities so they can lever that gas tax year going forward. We expect that this will fund more than $100 billion in new infrastructure for Canada over the course of the next seven years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124047">Unlike the opposition parties, we do not believe in raising taxes, especially a new, massive, punitive, permanent carbon tax, a new punitive tax on gasoline. We do not believe in doing that and we do not believe in spending recklessly like the Liberals did with their three budgets in their last year in office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124048"> We certainly do not believe in running deficits, but the Liberals have spending plans of $60 billion, plus they voted for a bill in the House this afternoon that will cost another $10 billion, so they are at $70 billion now in new spending. They will fund that by taxing Canadians and seniors, by dramatically increasing the cost of gasoline, of home heating fuel for Canadians, particularly for Canadians who can least afford it, who are on fixed incomes, driving up manufacturing costs in Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1124054">Mr. Chair, first, I thank the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> for his continued strong performance as Canada's finance minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124055">I have to make a comment first. Everybody in Canada knows the Liberals have never had a surplus they did not spend. The NDP have never seen a surplus it would not like to spend, but like the Bloc, it will never get a chance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124056">A question that came from across the way for the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> referred to comments about the Premier of Ontario. I come from Ontario so I have a right to speak to this. The premier announced a week or so ago that he would put a whole bunch of money into funding sex changes. However, he will not sign an agreement that will give funding to municipalities in Ontario or right across Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124057">As the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> mentioned, some sectors of the economy are having a tough go of it due to the high dollar, especially the manufacturing sector. As we know, the government has introduced significant measures to support the manufacturing sector and its workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124058">For workers, we have come out with the community development trust, which provides over $1 billion for communities and laid off workers. I know my home province of Ontario is using this money to help fund a retraining program, which estimates say will help 20,000 unemployed workers make the transition to new careers, and I know the Premier of Ontario is very appreciative of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124059">On that note, I would like to ask the minister about something that one of my colleagues, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78709" Type="2">Edmonton—Leduc</Affiliation>, brought to my attention, and it was brought to his attention by a business in his riding, City Lumber. Forklifts and other powered industrial lift trucks used for manufacturing do not qualify for the accelerated capital cost allowance. I know some of the businesses in my riding could also miss out because of this opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124060">Therefore, would the minister explain what is being done or what can be done to correct this situation.</ParaText>

I also to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="78709" Type="2">Edmonton—Leduc</Affiliation> for raising this issue with me, as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124062">As the member noted, our government has been taking important steps to assist the manufacturing sector, not through the use of ineffective and short term band-aid type solutions but rather longer term measures to create a more productive, competitive business environment, including the historic tax relief of nearly $200 billion and a stimulus that has been created for business, particularly in this time of economic slowness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124063">In Canada, the corporate tax reductions that were in the fall economic statement were described by the Canadian Manufacturers &amp; Exporters in this way, “important to the long-term competitiveness of the Canadian economy”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124064">In that spirit tonight and with respect to the question the member has posed, I confirm that forklifts used for manufacturing or processing will be eligible for the accelerated capital cost allowance treatment that was announced in budget 2007 and extended in budget 2008. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124065">Specifically, forklifts used in manufacturing or processing acquired after March 18, 2007, will qualify for the temporary manufacturing and processing incentive. This will ensure that forklifts receive the same accelerated capital cost allowance rate as other manufacturing related machinery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124066"> Again, I thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="78803" Type="2">Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound</Affiliation> for bringing this matter to my attention.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1124073">Mr. Chair, I listened to the speech given by the minister a few minutes ago. I find that he is out of touch with the current state of the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124074">China has replaced Canada as the leading exporter to the United States. This has resulted in a very significant loss of manufacturing jobs, particularly in Quebec and Ontario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124075">Under the Conservatives, 35,000 jobs were lost in 2006 and 43,000 in 2007 because the minister ignored the unanimous report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. He spoke earlier about the member for <Affiliation DbId="78709" Type="2">Edmonton—Leduc</Affiliation>. I was a member of the industry committee. We presented a unanimous report containing 22 recommendations to help the manufacturing sector and he only implemented half of one of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124076">Does the minister realize that because of his laissez-faire approach forestry workers in my riding—I am thinking of Saint-Pamphile, Saint-Just-de-Bretenières, Montmagny and l'Islet—and throughout Quebec and Ontario, feel that they have no government? I will not ask for an apology this evening but I would like to know if he is prepared to change his approach and his focus. He is presently allowing the economies of Quebec, Ontario and Canada to be completely subordinate to China's exports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124077">Yesterday, it was announced that Canada, for the first time, now has as many jobs in retail sales as in the manufacturing sector. That means that high paying jobs have been replaced by lower paying jobs. Are those the results he wants? I am asking for an answer from the minister.

              <ParaText id="1124079">I am very proud of the fact that the economic fundamentals of this country are strong. I am very proud of the fact that the government anticipated the economic slowdown this year. I am very proud of the fact that our government anticipated that the U.S. housing sector would, in fact, go into recession and that we took steps in advance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124080">Yes, we had the very helpful advice of the industry committee of which the hon. member is a member. We had its strong advice with respect to the proposed accelerated capital cost allowance. We took its advice. The member for <Affiliation DbId="78709" Type="2">Edmonton—Leduc</Affiliation> was chair of the committee. This was important advice. We brought in the two year writedown on the accelerated capital cost allowance and then extended it in budget 2008 going forward for three more years on a declining basis. This is a great help to industry in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124081">Why is this important? Just as the industry committee had noted, and the member knows this through his very helpful participation in that committee, if we are going to have a sustainable forestry industry in Canada, and if we are going to have a sustainable auto sector and auto parts sector in Canada, they must be sophisticated technologically. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124082">How can these companies afford to move forward and acquire the technology that they need? They can do it if we help them in the federal government and make sure that we make manufacturing and processing equipment more affordable. This is helped also by the appreciation of the Canadian dollar vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar because it makes a lot of this technology priced in U.S. dollars more affordable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124083">That is why we are seeing an increase in the acquisition of modern technology, machinery and equipment. Because we take the longer term view, we applaud business for taking advantage of this tax change, so they can get this machinery and equipment so that in the longer term they will be sustainable, competitive and be able to provide long term job security for Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1124096">Mr. Chair, like my colleague who just addressed the <Affiliation DbId="78700" Type="2">finance minister</Affiliation>, I think that the entire issue of the manufacturing sector in Quebec was completely forgotten in this budget. Before it was tabled, I visited a number of places in my riding, together with my colleague, in order to consult and find out what people expected from the budget. It turned out to be pretty close to what the Bloc was demanding. A little while ago, a Conservative said that I and the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Montmagny—L'Islet—Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup</Affiliation> met with the finance minister and told him what the people of Quebec were concerned about. It was the same thing I had been hearing everywhere in my riding, in Shawinigan, La Tuque or small towns. People definitely did not want to see such a large part of the surplus going to pay down the debt. People clearly needed a large part of these surpluses to go to the manufacturing sector to sustain its workers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124097"> The <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>  said that something like 19,000 jobs were created last month. I am not sure about this figure, but I would like to know how these jobs were distributed. I would like him to tell us a little later where these jobs were created, because I am sure they were not created equitably for all citizens, especially those in Quebec and the regions of Quebec. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124098"> I would also like him to revisit one item I could not find in the budget. I have a question for the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>. How is it possible that after promising during the last election campaign to make the guaranteed income supplement fully retroactive for our older people, he still has not managed after three budgets to find a way to provide equitable compensation for older people who were done out of the guaranteed income supplement, despite a $12 billion surplus? These people were entitled to it but did not know it. The Conservative Party promised to do this but still has not found a way. </ParaText>

We also created a tax-free savings account which is an important vehicle for young Canadians, however, it is also a very important vehicle for older Canadians in that they will be able to put aside $5,000 a year and earn interest on that, or dividends, or capital gains, or any other type of gain, and not have that money taxed when it comes out.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1124105">Mr. Chair, last fall, after the Bloc Québécois repeatedly asked the government to provide more support for the manufacturing sector—particularly in Quebec where the large majority of Canada's manufacturing jobs have been lost—the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> announced a $1 billion trust to benefit the communities that lost jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124106">This $1 billion trust was announced for a period of three years. Many people thought this would be sufficient. But in Quebec, there was still a significant outcry; in fact, almost everyone was in agreement that the amount was still not sufficient given the number of jobs lost in recent years. We then realized—the numbers were subsequently revealed to us at the Standing Committee on Finance—that the government had allocated this amount on a per capita basis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124107">This was completely unfair not only because the amount was insufficient, but mostly because of how it was allocated. If this amount had been allocated based on manufacturing jobs lost, it would have been much more advantageous and profitable for Quebec. Allocating it on a per capita basis meant that Quebec received $2,275 for each job lost and Alberta received $20,000 for each job lost. This is inexplicable. Quebec has been shortchanged, as have all of the people who lost their jobs.</ParaText>

Most Canadians would think it fair that the allocation of the community trust be on a per capita basis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124109">This is something that a number of the provinces argued for very strenuously with respect to transfers before we accomplished the fiscal balance that we did in 2007 by moving to those per capita transfers. Some of the smaller provinces, particularly with respect to post-secondary education, are concerned that this per capita transfer perhaps disadvantages them. I am sure that the hon. member will want to reflect on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124110">Having said that, the support for manufacturing is very strong: $9 billion in tax relief by 2012-13; $1.3 billion in additional funding beginning this fiscal year to the provinces for post-secondary education and labour market training to create a more highly skilled workforce; more than $1.5 billion over three years to support Canada's leadership in science and technology; action to streamline the regulatory system; a 20%, at least, reduction in that paper burden by November of this year; and $33 billion for infrastructure with P3s to be levered to fund infrastructure from the federal level at the highest level since the second world war.</ParaText>

Since this government came to power in January 2006, over 300,000 manufacturing sector jobs have been lost, 116,000 of those in Quebec alone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124118">The minister is right in saying that the total number of jobs has gone up. Manufacturing jobs allow workers to earn a good living to support their families. These jobs have been around for generations and most of them come with retirement benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124119">That is important not only for workers, but for future generations. Sustainable development is not just about the environment. It is also about society and the economy. Socially, we are transferring this responsibility to future generations.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1124137">Now, I have a question for the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> about fairness. Earlier, he spoke about his vision of a balanced economy. We think that the economy we have built since the second world war is balanced, because of its primary sectors, such as the forestry and mining industries, its secondary sector, for example the manufacturing industry, and its solid financial services sector, and so on. All of that is part of a balanced economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124138">Canada is a very big country. It is the second-largest country in the world in terms of area. But our population is very small—just 35 million. We need a balanced economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124139">The Conservative government has ignored the work done by previous generations to build a balanced economy <I>a mari usque ad mare</I>. The Conservatives are in the process of sacrificing it on the altar of the oil sands of Alberta. It will be up to the public to decide in the next election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124140">Let us talk about the justice of its vision by comparing what corporations and individuals must pay. I would refer him in particular to Table 5.4 in the budget and ask him to explain the vision behind the Conservative's decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124141">Here is the decision. The new fiscal year just began on April 1. So the beginning of last month marked the start of the 2008-09 fiscal year. Over the course of two full fiscal years, personal taxes are slated to rise from $112 billion to $125 billion, which is a 12% increase. Let me say that again: a 12% increase in personal taxes. As for corporate taxes, they will decrease from $42 billion to $36 billion, a drop of 14%. Let us take a look at the government's pie: personal taxes will increase by 12%, but corporate taxes will drop by 14%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124142">What is the minister's vision of social justice, given that he was born in a place where there are many manufacturers and working people, in Lachine, Quebec? Where has his social vision gone, now that he occupies this position?</ParaText>

Every time they buy something in this country, as of January 1 this year there is a full two percentage points off, which has had a very desirable effect with respect to inflation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124144">It has also made it easier to purchase larger ticket items in Canada, particularly automobiles. The experts in the automotive sector have talked about that GST reduction, as well as the revaluation of prices, as being a significant impetus to the very strong car sales we have had in Canada, unlike the United States, in the first three months of this year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124145">More people are earning more money in Canada. We have a progressive tax system of course. We have four categories of taxation, as I am sure the member knows, and we get more people moving into higher taxation levels which will affect personal income tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124146">The reduction of the business tax is entirely intentional. We made that clear in the announcement of the economic statement on October 30, 2007, that we have chosen a certain path. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124147">We have chosen to brand Canada as a low business tax jurisdiction. We have chosen to move to a targeted 25% provincial-federal tax rate by 2012. We are doing our part at the federal level, moving to 15% by 2012. Alberta is already at 10%. British Columbia is going in that direction and we expect that Manitoba will also. The former premier of New Brunswick, Mr. McKenna, spoke recently in Halifax and urged all of the Atlantic provinces to go in that direction. Quebec has made some movement in that direction. As the member knows, I have been gently encouraging the Premier of Ontario to go in that direction as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124148">I look forward to having further discussions with the other ministers of finance in Canada tomorrow and the next day in Montreal where one of the things we will talk about of course is how we brand Canada to attract foreign investment and to attract reinvestment in Canada and more high quality jobs for Canadians as we go forward.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1124162">Mr. Chair, I am pleased to join my parliamentary colleagues this evening to participate in the work of the committee of the whole on the Canadian government's main estimates.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124163">This evening, it is not the main estimates we should be talking about. Since the Conservative government has been here in Ottawa, we could talk about the main investments in the economy and in Canadian taxpayers. There is investment in agriculture, investment for pork producers and dairy producers, investment in the environment, in budget 2008 in particular, to create a carbon exchange to make our country a world leader in fighting climate change. There is also investment in education, but especially for future generations by reducing the debt. That is the real sustainable development our <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> is creating for our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124164">Thanks to the remarkable work of my colleague, the hon. <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, the hon. member for Whitby—Oshawa, the Canadian economy is improving and growing and taxpayers are finally seeing their taxes go down instead of up. This is true both for individuals and businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124165">The results of all this are clear. Over the past 12 months alone, we have seen the creation of over 300,000 jobs. Since we came to power, 750,000 jobs have been created, 80% of them full time. These are jobs for people across the country. This contrasts with and is diametrically opposed to what our colleagues opposite want to see. Their problem is that they think government money is their money. On this side of the House, we think that government money belongs to taxpayers and should go back to them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124166">My question for my colleague, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, is a simple one. How has he managed to stimulate the economy and reduce the tax burden on companies and taxpayers?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124167">I would like to revisit one important element. The official opposition has come up with a proposal that worries me. The price of gas is higher than ever before. It is as high as $1.50 in some places. This is a big problem for people in my riding who commute to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124168">My riding is far from urban centres. To move manufactured goods, we need a healthy economy, we need lower transportation costs, and we need the government to make sure that transportation costs do not go up. Now the official opposition wants to tax carbon and increase the cost of raw materials and the cost of transportation, even though these costs are already extremely high. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124169">That worries me. I would like to know what the minister plans to do to protect us from these rising costs, these huge increases that will take a heavy toll on the Canadian economy. We know that these tax grabs affect not just businesses but people with low incomes, society's most vulnerable members and seniors. That is inconceivable in the current context, where even though we have an economy running at full throttle, we are also facing certain challenges.</ParaText>

I would just like to point out that, in Quebec, more than 150,000 jobs have been created since the minister was appointed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124180">We must also acknowledge that it is due to our long-term vision for the Canadian economy, which applies to every budget. There is another important element: the current corporate tax rate is one of the most competitive among the G-7 countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124181">Our minister is doing remarkable work to ensure that our manufacturing sector is at the leading edge. For example, we have Exceldor in Saint-Anselme, Prévost Car in Sainte-Claire and Rotobec in Sainte-Justine, which benefit from tax breaks put in place by our government. In addition, we also reduced the GST. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124182">I could go on at length. Even organizations such as the United Way in Toronto acknowledge that this budget helps the most disadvantaged over the welfare wall.

Sydney Crosby scored with two minutes left in the first period. That is for the eight or nine Canadians who are not watching the game, but who are actually watching us do this in this place. That is a great Canadian taking action there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124202">We have reduced taxes of all kinds. We have also done something else and that is create the tax free savings account. This was something that needed to be done. In Canada we did not have a savings vehicle outside of the retirement savings vehicle and the RESP, not to mention the registered disability savings plan which this government created.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124203">This tax free savings account is terrific. It has been called by various commentators a jewel and a gem. If Bill <Document DbId="3354384" Type="3">C-50</Document> were to pass when it comes back to the House within the next day or two, what it means is as of January 1, 2009, Canadians 18 years of age or over would be able to contribute $5,000 a year tax paid into a fund and have any kind of gains, dividends, or accumulated interest within the fund, and have it paid out whenever they want. This is a tremendous advantage. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124204">Over time this is going to mean something like 90% of the savings of Canadians would be sheltered from taxation through one plan or another, especially for young people, but also for people of moderate means. During the first five years there will be no clawback. It is a terrific idea for Canadians to save money. I look forward to Canadians starting to save money through tax free savings accounts starting January 1, 2009.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1124282">Mr. Chair, it is a great pleasure tonight to rise and speak to the main estimates and about what this Conservative government is doing to effectively manage Canada's economy. Under the leadership of our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>, we have taken many important steps to improve the quality of life for Canadians over the last two years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124283">My remarks and my eventual questions to the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> will deal specifically with the tax-free savings account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124284"> It is clear to Canadians that this government is taking a very different approach than the Liberals. Their Liberal vision for the economy simply repeats the same broken tax-and-spend and tax again mantra of the 1970s, along with a dangerous addiction to uncontrolled spending and reckless deficit spending. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124285">It is a tax-and-spend philosophy that is leading the Liberals to call not only for a huge hike in the GST but also for what many have stated could be the single largest tax increase in Canada's history. The Liberal leader's new regressive carbon tax represents a huge tax increase for all Canadians. It is a tax increase that each and every Canadian will feel at the pumps, at the grocery store and each and every time they heat their home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124286">What is worse is that these tax hikes will have the most negative impact on low income Canadians, such as seniors living on fixed incomes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124287">With the potential Liberal GST hike and the new carbon tax, Canadians are being threatened by a Liberal government that will reach deeper and deeper into their pockets with a regressive, punitive tax that will directly cause the price of everyday items to increase. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124288">For instance, as farmers see their costs escalate, the result will be higher food prices. Large purchases such as a new home or a new car would skyrocket to such new heights that they would fall out of reach for some. Indeed, the prices of everything we make or buy would jump.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124289">Both the manufacturing and the shipping of products are tied to gas prices, making the cost of the products that we export more expensive and thus less attractive in many markets. This would create a huge disadvantage for Canada's manufacturing sector, a disadvantage that it simply cannot afford at this time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124290">Our Conservative government disagrees with the Liberals. We believe that Canadians should be allowed to keep more of their hard-earned dollars and to spend those dollars on what is important to them and their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124291"> That is why we have provided historic tax relief and cut the federal tax bill for families and individuals by $140 billion. This includes lowering personal income taxes and chopping the GST by two points. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124292">We also believe that the federal government should undertake measures to assist Canadians to save, helping to make it easier for them to invest in their retirement or make those larger purchases of life, such as a new home. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124293">In pursuit of this objective, budget 2008 unveiled the creation of the landmark tax-free savings account. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124294">It was a little over 50 years ago on March 14, 1957, that then finance minister Walter Harris, a lawyer from southern Ontario with a record of balanced budgets and who ran for the leadership of a major political party in Ontario, stood up in the House of Commons to announce a new tax plan to help Canadians save. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124295">At that time, the initiative was greeted with polite applause and passing interest as a measure mainly aimed at assisting those without workplace old age benefits to retire comfortably. From its humble beginnings, the registered retirement savings plan would go on to become an indispensable part of fiscal planning for every Canadian.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124296">And for that, along with his military service in World War II, we thank and we pay tribute to Walter Harris. In the city of Oshawa today, the Walter E. Harris Public Elementary School bears its name in his honour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124297">Now let us fast forward to the present day and another lawyer from southern Ontario, another finance minister with a record of balanced budgets and another politician who has run for the leadership of a major political party in Ontario. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124298">On February 26, 2008, our current <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Whitby—Oshawa</Affiliation>, would stand in the same chamber Walter Harris did over half a century ago to announce the single most important personal savings vehicle since the RRSP of 1957. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="30">(2130)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1124299">Described by the C.D. Howe Institute as a “tax policy gem” and by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business as an “inspired measure”, the tax-free savings account will allow Canadians to set aside money in eligible investment vehicles and watch those savings grow tax free for a lifetime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124300"> The tax-free savings account can be used to purchase a new car, to renovate a house, to start a small business or for retirement. In other words, this is tax-free money for what matters to individual Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124301">An important feature of the tax-free savings account is that Canadians from all income levels and all walks of life can benefit. Starting on January 1, 2009, Canadians aged 18 and older can save up to $5,000 every year in a tax-free savings account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124302"> While contributions will not be deductible for income tax purposes, investment income, including capital gains, earned in the tax-free savings account will not be taxed, even when withdrawn. Funds can be withdrawn from the savings account at any time for any purpose, tax free.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124303">Naturally, not everyone is able to save each and every year. The new savings account is flexible, allowing for a lifetime of savings. Those who cannot contribute $5,000 in a given year will be able to carry forward their unused contribution room to future years. In addition, Canadians may want to use their savings and the full amount of withdrawals, to be put back into the tax-free savings account in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124304">The Liberals across the floor must like it because this is the quietest they have been all evening. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124305">We believe that within the next 15 to 20 years over 90% of Canadians will hold all of their financial assets in tax-efficient savings vehicles, either through existing tax-deferred plans or this new savings account. This is a significant achievement as our population grows older, and it will provide a lasting legacy for the generations that follow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124306">Couples often save and plan together, so Canadians can contribute to their spouse's or common-law partner's tax-free savings account depending on the spouse's or partner's available room.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124307">Some people ask how the tax-free savings account is different from the RRSP. The basic difference is that an RRSP is intended primarily for retirement. We might say that the tax-free savings account is like an RRSP, but for everything else in our life. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124308">The benefits of saving in a tax-free savings account are evident. Because capital gains and other investment income earned in the tax-free savings account will not be taxed, the person contributing $200 a month, for example, to a tax-free savings account for 20 years will enjoy additional savings of $11,045 compared to saving in an unregistered account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124309">And the tax-free savings account provides benefits for seniors. It will provide seniors with a tax-free savings vehicle and meet ongoing savings needs, something seniors have only limited access to once they reach age 71 and are required to begin drawing down their registered retirement savings. Seniors are expected to receive one-half of the total benefits provided by this savings account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124310"> One of the best features of the tax-free savings account is that there is no impact on income tested benefits. As our government did with the GST cuts, we have taken the interests of low income Canadians into account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124311"> There will be no federal clawbacks resulting from the tax-free savings account. This means that neither income earned in a tax-free saving account nor withdrawals will affect eligibility for federal income tested benefits and credits such as the guaranteed income supplement and the Canada child tax benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124312">For people with low and modest incomes, this will improve incentives to save. In fact, it is estimated that in the first five years over 75% of the benefits of this savings account will go to individuals in the two lowest income tax brackets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124313">In closing, Canadians will benefit from this in many ways, but perhaps more importantly, it provides Canadians with the ability to start saving early for future needs. It is not a surprise that Canadians are excited. In my remaining time, I would like the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> to speak to the reaction that he has heard on this fine initiative.</ParaText>

Therefore, I will answer the member for <Affiliation DbId="78871" Type="2">Blackstrap</Affiliation>, who I thank for her representation of her constituents. She has been a tremendous asset to that part of Saskatchewan. We know that she has great support in that region. She does a great job backing up her minister. She is here tonight to help support one of the landmark pieces of our 2008 budget, the tax-free savings account, described by many, not just us, for its landmark savings opportunities for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124315">January 1, 2009, will bring this into effect. Canadians over the age of 18 will be permitted to deposit up to $5,000 each year. TFSA will provide greater savings incentives for low and modest income individuals. In the first five years, over three-quarters of the benefits will go to the lowest two tax brackets. That is one of the most important features to this. It provides an opportunity for all Canadians to save.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124316">Additionally, we have ensured TFSA income and withdrawals will not affect eligibility for federal income tested benefits and credits. To see how much we can save, I encourage all Canadians, and I will repeat this website, again, to go to www.budget.gc.ca. Our <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> has been very clear about reminding Canadians how they can save, and they can go to this website.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1124337">Mr. Chair, one has reason to be optimistic about the economy of Canada and the economy of Quebec. We have the strongest economic fundamentals in the G-7. We are the only country in the G-7 that has been able to reduce taxes, run a surplus in our budgets and pay down public debt at the same time. Canada is in great shape to endure a period of economic slowness in the United States and globally, which is exactly what we are doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124338">Yes, there is a time of adjustment in certain industries. I think most Canadians expect that when we have a slowdown, such as a recession in the U.S. housing industry, it is going to affect the forestry industry in Canada. A recession in the U.S. is going to affect manufacturing in Canada. It is going to affect the auto sector in Canada. The key is that we have stimulus in place to help the economy get through this and that we did it well in advance, starting in 2006, and, most important, with the fall economic statement in 2007, with dramatic business tax reductions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124339">The member opposite should recognize that this is a time of some economic slowness. The good news is Canada will come through it well.</ParaText>

I am looking at page 224 of the budget document for this year, in 2007-08, the last fiscal year, cash transfers are at an all time high and have grown to almost 19% of total federal spending, their highest level in almost 30 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124369">I must say that after we moved forward with the efforts we were making toward creating fiscal balance, the steps we took based on the O'Brien report were welcomed by the Government of Quebec and resulted in $8 billion through equalization, an increase of over 67% from 2005-06; $5.5 billion through the Canada health transfer, $2.5 billion through the Canada social transfer, as I say, an increase of $4.5 billion since the Liberal government of 2005-06.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1124429">First of all, the issues related to non-bank backed asset-backed commercial paper where the entities were largely, if not solely, supposed to be regulated by provincial authorities in Canada.

Also, the issue that was raised by my hon. friend from <Affiliation DbId="78435" Type="2">Peterborough</Affiliation> has to do with neutral recognition of securities regulators around the world or free trade in securities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124431">Canada was taking a leading role on this issue in the G-7, not only within the G-7 but with other countries in the world including Australia and discussions with New Zealand and so on. This is a tremendous opportunity for Canada to take leadership with respect to mutual recognition of securities regulators and get a competitive advantage for Canada by taking that leading role. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124432">Lo and behold, the SEC in the United States, because we have this plethora of securities regulators in Canada, decided to go ahead and have its initial negotiations preferring Australia over Canada despite the fact that we were the nation advocating the cause at the G-7.

              <ParaText id="1124435">Mr. Chair, the Liberal leader recently said Canada should lower taxes on things we want more of and raise them on things we want less of. In Peterborough I assume he means he wants fewer people working. He wants less manufacturing. He wants fewer people living in rural communities. He wants to disadvantage seniors. I guess that is what he wants less of. I do not understand it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124436"> What he wants to bring in is a special Liberal carbon tax. It would be a disaster for Peterborough.

Sometimes they like to turn a light on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124437">In fact, some people in Peterborough might even be watching this on their television and the Liberal leader wants to increase their cost of electricity. I guess that is what he wants less of. He wants people enjoying their life a lot less and paying a lot more tax so he can spend it because we all know he has made $72 billion in promises and a $10 billion promise just tonight.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1124523">Mr. Chair, I am thankful for the opportunity to speak to the Department of Finance's main estimates for 2008-09 and more broadly to the economic leadership of our Conservative government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124524">Under the leadership of our outstanding <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> and this Conservative government, we have delivered three straight balanced budgets along with two economic statements, truly remarkable achievements in a minority Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124525">Included in these achievements is our centrepiece economic plan, “Advantage Canada”, which we outlined to Canadians in November of 2006. “Advantage Canada” represents a prudent, long term road map to ensure Canada has strong economic fundamentals. It is a plan designed to help ensure Canada truly becomes an economic leader through tax, fiscal, entrepreneurial, knowledge and infrastructure advantages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124526"> “Advantage Canada” is not the reactionary, short term and ultimately ineffective economic plan, and I use that word loosely, being advocated by the Liberal opposition. This government has rejected the flight to panic the Liberals have embraced when it comes to economic policy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124527">Instead, with “Advantage Canada” we have brought forward a long term plan that not only addresses the challenges of today but prepares us for the opportunities of tomorrow. There is nothing like a message of hope. The Canadian Council of Chief Executives has observed that “the Advantage Canada strategy...will enable Canadians to take on the world and win”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124528">Tonight I would like to focus on one key component of the “Advantage Canada” plan: the creation of a fiscal advantage through debt repayment. Our Conservative government has set ambitious debt repayment targets. Indeed, we are aiming to eliminate total government net debt within a generation or by 2021. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124529">Why? Unlike Liberal governments past, our Conservative government refuses to saddle our children and grandchildren with the bill for the excesses of the past and the present. We refuse to pass on a large national mortgage. We understand that debt just delays taxation to the next generation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124530">However, we are not merely musing about debt reduction with empty words and hollow promises, the hallmarks of Liberal governments past. We are taking decisive and aggressive steps to meet our targets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124531">Indeed, since forming government a little over two years ago, we have already reduced Canada's debt by $37 billion. We have brought Canada's national mortgage to its lowest level in 25 years and federal debt to GDP ratio to historic lows. Put another way, we have reduced Canada's national debt by almost $1,570 for each and every man, woman and child in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124532">Yet challenges remain. Despite our aggressive action, our national debt remains considerable at nearly $457 billion in 2007-08. Interest charges on all that debt will cost roughly $31 billion a year or about $85 million every single day, meaning that approximately 13.5¢ of every taxpayer dollar sent to Ottawa will go simply to pay the interest on our debt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124533">Amazingly enough, though, some in the House have suggested that all of this is not really a concern and have even criticized our government for having the audacity to even consider our national debt a problem. For instance, the Liberal leader flippantly dismisses the national debt as “light”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124534">Instead, he wants to plunge Canada into a massive $60 billion deficit spending spree that would wipe out our progress in taming the national debt. I want Canadians to think about the Liberal leader's thinking for a moment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124535"> If someone we knew was personally half a million dollars in debt, decided to go out on a reckless shopping spree, max out his or her credit card or rack up a $60,000-plus bill the person could not afford, and as a consequence add to his or her existing debt, what would we say to the that person? I suspect the words “fiscally irresponsible” would jump to mind. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124536">Therefore, I ask Canadians if they really agree with the Liberal leader when he calls our $457 billion national debt “light”. I will let a recent Montreal <I>Gazette</I> editorial answer that question. It states:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1124543"> Furthermore, we believe that when the debt load falls, Canadian taxpayers, not government coffers in Ottawa, should benefit. That is why we legislated into law the landmark tax back guarantee. Under this guarantee, each year interest savings from federal debt reduction are returned to the Canadian taxpayers through permanent and sustainable personal income tax reductions. What a novel plan for Canadians. What a great idea. As of 2009-10, personal income tax reductions provided under the guarantee will amount to a whopping $2 billion. No wonder the Canadian Taxpayers Federation called our tax-back guarantee music to taxpayers' ears.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124544">I would like to delve into some of the longer term structural benefits of debt reduction which, while not necessarily top of mind, are crucially important to a strong Canada and a strong economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124545">First, the most direct benefit of lower debt is that less revenue is absorbed by interest charges, freeing up resources for more productive uses. As the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants has recently noted, continued debt reduction remains vital to improving the government's financial condition, enhancing prosperity and providing the flexibility needed to deliver on meaningful tax deductions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124546">Second, low public debt also helps keep interest rates low. In the early 1990s, inflation adjusted long term interest rates averaged over 6%, reflecting in part the risk posed to investors by the much higher level of indebtedness in Canada at the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124547">Since the government sets the benchmark for all the borrowers in the economy--provincial and municipal governments, corporations and households--high federal debt imposes a significant cost to the economy. Higher borrowing costs led to lower private sector investment and a less productive economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124548">Today, ongoing surpluses and falling federal debt help keep interest rates low. Inflation adjusted, long term interest rates are currently just over 2%. This makes it easier for Canadian corporations to raise funds to finance capital investment, and that translates into higher private sector investment and a more vibrant, productive economy, creating more jobs for more Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124549">This also benefits Canadians more directly as well. For instance, lower interest rates produce real savings for families making a big purchase, like the young couple in Oakville buying a new $200,000 house. Having already seen a $4,000 price reduction because of the GST cut, with a $160,000 25 year mortgage, they would save over $1,100 annually for each percentage point drop in interest rates.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124550">Debt also, as I alluded to earlier, represents a tax on future generations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124551">Before criticizing our Conservative government's record of aggressive debt repayment again, I encourage the Liberal finance critic to take a break from working on the Liberal Party of Canada's secret plan for a massive new gas tax on home heating for seniors and those on fixed incomes, and to listen to his own words. He said that, with an aging population, it is crucially important to pay down debt so we baby boomers do not leave our children and our children's children in terrible shape.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1124554">Mr. Chair, we went through a time in Canadian political history, and certainly in the political economy, in the 1970s and 1980s and into the 1990s when it was common for federal governments, and provincial governments as well, to run deficits. The substantial public debt we have in Canada now is the sum of those accumulated deficits over those years. We do not want to go back to those years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124555">The official opposition in this place is saying it is going to spend an additional $60 billion. It voted for a bill this afternoon in the House of Commons that would require another $10 billion a year. There is $70 billion. How is the opposition going to pay for it? Now we are starting to hear about a carbon tax, as the Liberals call it, a tax on gasoline, a tax on electricity, a tax on home heating fuel, a tax that would have the greatest punitive burden on those with fixed incomes, poor seniors in this country, people receiving minimal pensions, and so on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124556">We do just the opposite. We allow pension splitting which will save people thousands of dollars this year when they file their income tax returns. The official opposition would do just the opposite. They want to prey on seniors and make it more difficult for them to pay their monthly bills by driving up costs by new taxation. It is not surprising, because the Liberal way of doing government is big spending, big tax increases, running deficits, and accumulating public debt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124557"> For all of the reasons expressed by my hon. friend, this is not in the long term best interests of the country and it is not fair. We should think of the next generation and the generation after that. Why should we be living on borrowed money and asking the next generation to pay the costs? It is not fair intergenerationally. Most people would think it is not fair and would say that we should pay our bills as we go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124558">That is where we are going as a government. We are paying down large sums of public debt and reducing personal taxes. Every time we do it by means of the tax back guarantee. We intend to continue on that path, not on the path advocated on the other side of the House of high taxation, high spending, and running deficits.</ParaText>

We ask the departments what is the least important 5% of their spending that has the least priority?

There were record deficits and poor financial management.</ParaText>

Let us go back to 1989 and the huge deficits under the former Conservative administration. That was the year of the implementation of the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement. I would like to ask him a very simple question about economic trends. Since 1989 to the most recent figures available, is the income of most Canadian families up or down?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1124571">What has actually happened, and the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> should know this, is the following. For those families earning between $36,000 and $56,000 a year, since 1989 they have actually seen their real income fall by 3%. They have lost about a week's income. That is 20% of the Canadian population. Let us go further. For those families earning between $20,000 and $36,000 a year, what have they lost? In real terms since 1989, their real income has gone down by 4%. They lost two weeks of income. The worst collapse in income has been among the poorest Canadian families, that is, 20% of families earning less than $20,000 a year. They have lost nearly 10% of their income. That is six weeks of income they have lost. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124572">What has happened since 1989 is that for two-thirds of Canadian families their real income has gone down. That is the answer and that is what a competent minister of finance would be looking at. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124573">Let me go to another question and see if he gets this one right. Statistics Canada reports indicate the nature of most jobs created in today's economy. My next question is very simple. Are most jobs created in today's economy part time and temporary, or are most jobs created in today's economy full time and permanent?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1124575">With respect to the previous question regarding cumulative growth in Canadian living standards, I recommend the hon. member look at the budget plan 2008 on page 36. He will see the graph that shows Canadian living standards have increased by more than 20% since the end of 2001. Household net worth has gone up dramatically in Canada as well from 1990 to 2007.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1124577">The other thing we have done for households in Canada which is quite dramatic is we have reduced the tax burden. We have reduced not only the personal income tax burden, but also the consumption tax, the GST, by 2%. And very important for pensioners, not just seniors, we are allowing income splitting which has meant a dramatic tax reduction. All of this contributes to household purchasing power and household wealth.</ParaText>

Who tells us that family income has declined for most Canadian families? Statistics Canada, the national government's statistical agency. Of course, if we mix everything together, there has been an outstanding growth in income for the wealthiest of Canadians. Members of the Conservative Party are saying, “Great. The wealthy are wealthier than ever”. They now take half of the entire income pie in this country, so one would think the Minister of Finance would chart that. Of course, he has not been following those trends. For most Canadian families, their real income has gone down.

              <ParaText id="1124584">We also support the accurate use of statistics. He is reaching back into the 1980s now to try to demonstrate that in the late 1980s, over 20 years, to 2008, family incomes have not done well. He ignores, of course, the recession at the beginning of the decade of the 1990s. He loves to not mention that happened then, distorting the numbers. He is enjoying the distortion, all right but it does not help Canadians very much.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124585">If he looks at the cumulative growth of Canadian living standards from 2002 to the end of 2007 he will see a growth of 20%.

              <ParaText id="1124586">As I said to him, the data shows that 80% of the more than 750,000 net new jobs created in Canada have been as a result of a Conservative government being in office, and 80% are full time jobs and most of the jobs are in the service sector.

              <ParaText id="1124595">They lost $21-an-hour jobs, good manufacturing jobs in the auto sector and the softwood industry in British Columbia, which we certainly know about, which was as a result of the softwood sellout and other very poor economic choices.

              <ParaText id="1124599">I can remember in 1995, before the government changed, which is what the member considers strong fiscal management, where the government had to pay $1 million an hour in interest on the accumulated public debt in the province of Ontario, where we had a government that thought it could spend its way out of economic difficulties, where we had a government, not unlike the Liberal government opposite here now, that thinks the solution to the problem is to increase taxes, increase the tax burden on people, run a deficit, yes, that is right, and run up spending. That is the way the member for <Affiliation DbId="120535" Type="2">Toronto Centre</Affiliation> governed Ontario from 1990 to 1995 and it is the way the Liberal opposition wants to take us back to the good old days.</ParaText>

It was his ministry that said, not that the NDP is perfect, and I certainly would agree with that, but that he was worse, that the Conservative governments and Liberal governments are worse. Two-thirds of the time over that 20 year period the actual fiscal period returns were in deficit. That is the Conservative record according to his own department.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124602">He has seen the study. He knows the Department of Finance has done that analysis and he knows that two-thirds of the time Conservative governments were in deficit. The only party with a worse record was the Liberal Party. Eighty-six per cent of the time it was in deficit. His own department has made that evaluation. One would expect that he would read that study and learn from it. Most of the time NDP governments balance their budget. That is the reality according to the federal Department of Finance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124603">I have asked a number of questions and the minister has not actually answered any of them, which is quite disappointing, because as the economic steward of the country one would expect that he would be aware of the fall in real family incomes and aware of the fact that his government is creating part time and temporary jobs that basically come at two-thirds of the wage levels of the jobs that he has lost. </ParaText>

If it were true analysis, it would have shown a detrimental impact on women. The minister then chose not to use that information and went ahead in any case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124654">I will give one example. The $5,500 savings plan, in fact, does absolutely nothing for women because 40.4% of women do not even pay any taxes. The average income of women in general is about $37,000 a year. Most of them do not have the ability to put aside any money. This only helps high income and mostly males in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124655">Could the minister tell me that he then chose not to listen to the analysis when he made his decision?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1124656">Mr. Chair, the member opposite is making an assumption that is nonsensical, and that is some sort of fifty-fifty balance must be achieved on every budget item. Of course there are some budget items that favour some people in certain occupations, for example, truck drivers who happen to be more commonly male than female. The gender analysis shows that, yes, it is a more male gender favourable tax provision. Then the government has to decide whether to do it or not. Then there are other tax provisions that are more favourable to women as a group than to men. Therefore, these are matters that we look at during the course of the budget preparation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124657">However, to make the assumption that there is some kind of magic fifty-fifty here is out of touch with the world.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1124659">The other thing that has also hurt women is the $1,200, which is supposed to be a universal child care program. In fact, it does nothing for the average woman, especially single parents. It does absolutely nothing for low income women to get back to work. Again, it hurts. The lower the income, the less money they get, so this is very detrimental.</ParaText>

It is important to remind Canadians, as the United Steelworkers did, that the manufacturing crisis did not start when the Conservatives took office. The Liberals had 12 years to deal with this stuff and they did nothing. Unlike the Liberals, this Conservative government has taken decisive action over the last two years to help the manufacturing sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124705">Ontario's automotive sector has been affected by the slowing global economy. The sector remains the largest manufacturing industry in the country and has a proven global reputation for quality and productivity, helping Canada rank as one of the top vehicle-producing countries in the world. I am proud to say that includes my home town of St. Catharines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124706">To maintain its leadership and competitive advantage, Canada's automotive sector is moving to become more innovative and adapt to new environmental standards. This requires a highly skilled workforce and increased investment in research and innovation to develop new process technologies and vehicles that are more fuel efficient and environmentally sustainable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124707">To help the automotive sector, the Conservative government has committed over $1.6 billion to measures that will help the automotive industry successfully meet these challenges. These include $1 billion in tax relief for the auto sector by 2012-13 and $250 million, a quarter of a billion dollar investment, over five years, through a new automotive innovation fund, to support large-scale research and development projects to develop innovative and more fuel efficient vehicles. It also includes $400 million as a contribution toward the access road to the new Windsor-Detroit border crossing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124708">In includes an enhancement to Export Development Canada's existing export guarantee program that will increase coverage, benefiting particularly those businesses in the automotive sector. Specifically, EDC will increase its guarantee coverage under the export guarantee program from 75% to 90% for loans up to $500,000. This will assist small and medium sized manufacturers in fulfilling export contracts. EDC is also working to enhance its financing and insurance products in support of the automotive and manufacturing sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124709"> We fulfilled our promise to cut the GST, and we have reduced it by two full points, making cars more affordable. In fact, last month, car sales rose yet again, the fifth increase in six months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124710">However, the Liberals want to undo these positive steps by not only increasing the GST, but also imposing, as the minister has clearly stated, a gouging gas tax that will make purchasing a car more expensive and devastate the auto sector in our province.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124711">The list of what the government has done for the auto sector does not end here. Let us talk a little about research and development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124712">Maintaining Canada's competitive advantage also requires investment in research and development. Canada continues to be a world leader in funding post-secondary research, ranking second in the OECD and first in the G-7.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1124713">To maintain Canada's premier position, budget 2008 builds on this investment. When I say premier, I am not talking about the two former premiers from the Liberal Party who sit across the way. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124714">I am talking about a budget that talks about investment to continue to support world class research and researchers at our universities, including $34 million per year to the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council for collaborative research that directly contributes to the knowledge and innovation needs of Canada's automotive, manufacturing, forestry and fishing industries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124715">The government also recognizes that increasing business investments in research and development will be crucial for our long term competitiveness. Budget 2008 enhances support for business investments with improvements to the scientific research and experimental development tax, which we at finance committee call SR&amp;ED. This new incentive and new program to support research and development investment in the automotive industry is something to be spoken about. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124716">This government realizes that investing in the future means investing in knowledge, it means investing in science, and it means investing in innovation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124717">I want to speak a bit about the capital cost allowance. It was not introduced in 2008. In fact, it was introduced in 2007, but the minister extended the program. We are providing further assistance for Canada's manufacturing and processing sector by extending the accelerated capital cost allowance treatment for investment in machinery and equipment for three years. Specifically, the 50% straight line accelerated capital cost allowance treatment will apply for one additional year and the accelerated treatment will then be provided on a declining basis over a two year period. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124718">I have to congratulate the member for <Affiliation DbId="78554" Type="2">Burlington</Affiliation> who chairs the steel caucus. He is doing an excellent job. Representatives from the steel industry across this country sat down and met with us tonight and credited a number of things. The one thing that stood out this evening for us when they spoke was the fact that the accelerated capital cost allowance is telling its employees of the future that they are wanted, they are needed, and they are accepted in every manufacturing company in this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124719">In addition, we are supporting small and medium sized businesses by improving the scientific research and experimental development tax incentive program and easing the tax compliance burden by reducing the record keeping requirements for automotive expense deductions and taxable benefits. In other words, we are going to make sure we reduce the red tape.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124720">Let me speak for a couple of moments about the community development trust. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124721">While Canada's economic fundamentals remain solid, the government recognizes that there are some workers and communities that face challenges in adjusting to changes in the international economy. That is why in January 2008 the government announced up to $1 billion for the community development trust to support those experiencing hardship due to international economic volatility. The 2008 budget built on this initiative by providing an additional $90 million to extend to 2012 the targeted initiative for older workers to help older workers stay in the workforce.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124722">A one billion dollar investment, $350 million in the province of Ontario, was an investment made by the federal government. As much as we would like the provinces and the territories to give the federal government credit for making this investment, we realize that those dollars are transferred to them to allow them to make decisions according to what they believe to be in the best interests of the businesses in their provinces and territories. We are not asking for credit. We did not ask the provinces to go out and state that we were the ones who provided that community investment fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124723"> It takes a lot of guts and it takes a lot of nerve for the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> to allocate $1 billion for community reinvestment across this country with the full understanding that they and this government would not receive credit for it, not because we wanted the credit but because it was the right thing to do at the right time, in the right place, in this country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1124724">Now, finally, Canada's economic fundamentals are solved and that is good news for all sectors and for all Canadians. We have paid down debt. We have reduced taxes paid by families and individuals. We have also cut corporate taxes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124725">In fact, let me take a moment to outline that we have taken steps federally by lowering business taxes to 15% by 2012. This will encourage investment, promote competitiveness, and most importantly, increase productivity. We certainly hope that other jurisdictions with large manufacturing sectors will follow suit and lower their corporate taxes. We can only lead by example; we cannot dictate.</ParaText>

Also, we are looking at $500 million to help improve public transit; $400 million to help recruit new front line police officers; and nearly $250 million for carbon capture and storage, both in Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia.

              <ParaText id="1124735">I discovered the reason this afternoon when the budgets were crammed down our throats for the creation of a Canada-wide securities commission. The Conservatives' desire to centralize, with the support of the Liberals, led to the voting of supply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124736"> Obviously, if there had been Conservative members from Quebec on the committee, they would have been so uncomfortable that they would have been unable—I hope—to vote with the Conservatives, and would have contradicted their own regime. </ParaText>

However, the theft and diversion of $54 billion by the Conservative government and the Liberal government before it has been confirmed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124743">All that aside, I have a question. The Conservative government, which had a $10 billion surplus at the end of last year, saw the Government of Quebec introduce a program for the manufacturing sector. How could the Conservative government then turn around and allocate just $1 billion for a trust for all of Canada but put $10 billion toward the debt, thereby abandoning Quebec, Ontario and the provinces that are having a lot more difficulty making ends meet? They do not have the financial means since the fiscal imbalance has not been completely resolved. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124744">Why did the Conservative government make such an egotistical decision, as though it were a corporation rather than a government, to allocate 100% of the surplus to the debt, while leaving manufacturing businesses in their difficult situations?

I understand also that we have brought in funding to assist one-industry towns facing major economic slowdowns. That is through the $1 billion community development trust.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124747">I understand that we have made historic pre-emptive corporate business tax reductions for industry that run out every year up to 2012. It is less of a burden for them.

It is the way to go because it makes it possible for these industries to retool and become more innovative. It makes them competitive in a world market. It makes them more productive and at the end of the day that is what makes them sustainable and that is where the sustainable long term jobs will be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124749">It is important, it seems to me, that we look at the longer term, but in the shorter term of course because some workers are displaced, particularly older workers between the ages of 55 and 62, we have the targeted initiative for those older workers to assist them to adjust at a time in their lives where no doubt it is more difficult to adjust.</ParaText>

He is not a separatist or a Bloc member, but rather someone who represents small- and medium-sized manufacturing businesses in Quebec. He gave the federal budget a failing grade when it comes to the manufacturing sector. He fully understands that tax cuts do nothing to help businesses that are not making any profit and are struggling to survive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124752">What is needed—and this was repeated and indicated in the unanimous report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology—are refundable tax credits to allow those businesses to be productive. That is what the people of Beauce and Chaudière-Appalaches wanted. A number of members here represent those ridings. There was a minister from Beauce, although he is once again a backbencher. There are members from Chaudière-Appalaches and other parts of Quebec. How is it that they could not convince the government to do something and implement such measures?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1124753">We never said we were against tax cuts, but other measures were needed to help businesses that are going through a rough period at this time. How is it that the minister, who read the unanimous report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology last fall, did not see that he had the financial means to act and that it was important to do so? Is that not why Quebeckers are judging this Conservative budget so harshly? This budget does not meet the needs of Quebec. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1124764">What have we done? We have provided over $1 billion in tax relief to the forestry industry by 2012-13. There is the $1 billion community development trust. As the member knows, that money is for workers and for communities directly affected. There is $160 million for the targeted initiative for older workers. There is $200 million with respect to the mountain pine beetle infestation in B.C. and Alberta, so far. There is $127.5 million for the forest industry long term competitiveness support. There is $25 million for the forest communities program to assist 11 forest based communities make informed decisions on the forest land base. We secured the return of over $5 billion in duty deposits to Canadian producers by implementing the softwood lumber agreement in October 2006. A lot has been done.</ParaText>
