As part of the broader corrections review that was launched by our government earlier this year, an expert panel will be looking not just at these but at other issues. We appreciate the work of the Correctional Investigator. I table it today. </ParaText>

I am tabling, in both official languages, the Report to Parliament on Actions Taken to Recover Amounts Improperly Paid Out as Reported in the Auditor General's Report on the Office of the Correctional Investigator of Canada, in response to the recommendation the Auditor General made in paragraph 11.35 of her November 2006 report under “Protection of Public Assets--Office of the Correctional Investigator”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756652">This report shows that our government has once again taken a stand against the mismanagement of taxpayers' dollars. We have successfully recovered the funds that were identified by the Auditor General as improperly received by the former correctional investigator under the watch of the previous Liberal government.</ParaText>

The purpose of this bill is to amend the Canadian Environmental Protection Act to prohibit the use or sale in Canada and the import of dishwasher detergents and laundry detergents that contain phosphorus. It has become necessary to prohibit detergents that contain phosphorus, because in large quantities, phosphorus contributes to the spread of blue algae.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756656">Given the Conservatives' lack of action, the Bloc Québécois decided to introduce this bill, since the problem of blue algae is getting worse. The federal government must take the measures falling under its jurisdiction to protect our bodies of water.</ParaText>

The petitioners call on Parliament to pass a motion that would enable communities to provide a safe haven whereby mothers can legally, safely and humanely abandon their babies without fear of reprisals.

              <ParaText id="756697">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to speak to this motion. I would like to share my time with my colleague, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78821" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756698">What I would like to do in my time is tell members about what I believe to be the core of Liberal economic policy as expressed in the motion and compare that with the economic approach of the Conservatives and the NDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756699">In a nutshell, I would state that the Liberal position on economic policy is to build a richer Canada in the medium term.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="756700">Why a richer Canada? In part, because our citizens and their families want a better quality of life. And in order to create social justice, we must also create wealth. Thus, wealth must be created in the medium term.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="756701">Why in the medium term? Because, even though the economy may be doing quite well today, for reasons totally unrelated to that government, things will not necessarily always be that way and we need to focus on the medium term in a hugely competitive world that does not owe Canada a living. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756702">Our position is to develop a series of policies to create a richer Canada in the medium term. There are basically two elements in that strategy. On the one hand, competitive and appropriate levels of taxation and, on the other hand, investments in order to bring about this richer Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756703">On the tax side, our position is that we need broad based reductions in personal and corporate income taxes, but balanced by the need for government investment to promote that growth and balanced as well by our commitment to a greener and fairer Canada. Our leader has stressed, in particular, the importance of deeper corporate tax cuts as a primary means of achieving the investment, the rising living standards and the jobs, jobs, jobs that we all want for ourselves and our children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756704">In particular, now that our currency is at par, now that we do not have the crutch of a weak currency to attract investment into this country, we need to create a new Canadian advantage. The new Canadian advantage in the Liberal vision, somewhat reminiscent of the Irish experience, is to tell investors that if they invest in Canada they will pay a whole lot less corporate tax than if they invest south of the border.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756705">The second part of the Liberal approach is not only competitive taxes but investments in research and development, access to post-secondary education, infrastructure, commercialization and skills development. Those are the two planks of the Liberal vision of how to create a richer Canada in the medium term.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756706">I will turn to the Conservatives. Whereas our focus is on a richer Canada in the medium term, they see everything through a short term electoral lens, influenced as well by a good dose of ideology. I will give a few examples to illustrate this point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756707">Whereas we believe in broad based tax cuts, the Conservatives, for electoral reasons, believe in narrowly defined, boutique social engineering tax credits. They, for example, would give credits and benefits to young hockey players but would deprive young violin players of those benefits. It is our view that the decision between hockey and violin playing should rest in the family and should not be determined by the government. That is why we would give tax relief to all and not just to a select few for electoral purposes. It is they, not we, who are the social engineers in this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756708">The second example is that the Conservatives, for obvious electoral purposes, decided to cut the GST and to raise income tax to do that. Just today in the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, 20 out of 20 economists surveyed said that this was the worst thing to do, and we concur in that, but the Conservatives did it purely because they felt they would get electoral gain. I question that too. I think most Canadians would rather have a tax cut, giving them a better paycheque, than a penny off the price of coffee at Tim Horton's. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756709">My last example is investment. We believe in investment as an important component of our growth strategy. The Conservatives do not. We believe in supporting research and innovation in universities. They slashed that in their almost two years in power. Why did they slash it? I guess they thought there were not many votes in it. However, we think it is the right thing to do for the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756710">On post-secondary education, we would put $6,000 per post-secondary student into the pockets of the students. What did the Conservatives do? A paltry, demeaning, insulting, maximum $80 tax credit for textbooks. That illustrates the differences. We are driven by the medium term creation of wealth in this country and they are driven by short term electoral considerations.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="756711">Now I will turn to the NDP. The fundamental point about the NDP is that those members do not understand economics. They never understood economics and they never will understand economics. In effect, the NDP is mired in a time warp in the 1960s. The NDP today is like the British Labour Party in the 1960s. The NDP has never had the courage or the leadership to find its own Tony Blair to lead it out of the 1960s into at least the 1970s or perhaps it could get to the 1980s, the 1990s or the new millennium, but it has not. It is mired in the 1960s. It has no vision of wealth creation and no clue how to go about it should that be its desire, which is why that party will remain a marginal protest party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756712">I will concede that the NDP members, like us, favour a greener, fairer Canada, but where they fall down is that they do not have a clue about how to create a richer Canada and, arguably, they do not even want one. Canadians require a governing party that can manage the economy competently, and the NDP is back in the 1960s on that topic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756713"> I will give the House one example. At the latest NDP convention, a motion was put forward by the leader's riding association that Canada should get out of NAFTA and out of the WTO. Those members also want Canada to get out of Norad, by the way. The NDP's official policy since 1997 has been that Canada should get out of NAFTA. That was delusional, clueless, irresponsible policy and it is still characterized in the neanderthal economic thinking of the New Democratic Party.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="756716">I remember well the debates in the late 1980s about the free trade agreement and I remember the NDP position. The NDP members would have constructed a wall around Canada to keep everything out, a wall so high that it would be reminiscent of the wall then prevailing in communist Albania.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756717">Canadians can see through this. The vast majority of Canadians want nothing to do with a party of economic Luddites, which is why that party is marginal, why it will remain marginal and why it is not taken seriously by the people of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756718">If a Tony Blair were to emerge and lead the NDP to sanity, then it might be a force. However, until that day comes, it is the Liberal Party and not the New Democratic Party that is and will remain the party of choice, the natural habitat for progressive Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="756725">I have spent more time in the university world than I have in politics. I have spoken to people at universities and university presidents and they are extremely depressed at the sad state of finances and support for research in which they have found themselves since the election of the Conservative government. They recall a speech given to them by the former prime minister, Mr. Chrétien, who said, “We're putting billions into research in universities. There is probably not a vote there but we're doing it because it is right for Canada”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756726">The new <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> comes along and makes the same calculation. He sees that there are not too many votes in supporting research in universities so he cuts it all.

Yes, they did a great job in Saskatchewan but no thanks to this lot in the NDP. They have never been in government as the Saskatchewan people have and they never will be, thank goodness for Canadians. Therefore, any comparison to the Saskatchewan provincial NDP and the federal NDP is utterly and totally irrelevant.</ParaText>

I am always inspired by his erudite words on economic issues. It makes a big difference for our party to have him leading us on economic policy but it also informs the thinking of the House. I am certain that if the Conservatives opposite listened closely, they could learn a great deal from members on this side about economic mantra in general.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756734">The history of tax policy goes back quite a bit. In 1678, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, minister of finance to Louis XIV of France, said, “The art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to obtain the largest possible amount of feathers with the smallest possible amount of hissing”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756735">I would hope that over the last 400 years or so we have actually evolved from that and we can actually see tax policy for what it really is in the modern world: an opportunity, through reforming our tax system, to create economic growth, prosperity and a richer, fairer, cleaner and greener Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756736">There is a tremendous opportunity for governments in a large surplus position to actually reform the tax system to attract capital, to attract talent and to make Canada a global leader in what will be the fastest growing area of the global economy, that of clean energy and environmental technology.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="756738">The fact is there are many prescriptives that are being provided to the government by economists within Canada and outside of Canada as to what ought to be done with the taxes. We have not had meaningful tax reform in Canada since 1971 with the Carter commission. Since then, in fact the Canadian economy and the global economy have changed remarkably. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756739">We need to reform our tax system. We need to lower taxes on investment and capital. In the old days capital was not as mobile as it is today. In the old days the tax system was used to redistribute income. Today it redistributes capital.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756740">The fact is a country like Canada during an age of free trade and freer trade cannot afford to have higher capital taxes, higher taxes on investment and ultimately on productivity, and higher corporate taxes than our trading partners. Other countries have reformed their tax systems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756741">The hon. member mentioned Ireland. Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, and the Netherlands have all reformed their tax system to create more economic growth and prosperity. The reason I mention some of the Scandinavian examples is for my friends in the New Democratic Party to recognize that in fact progressive social policy can coexist with innovative, forward thinking economic policy. It is not a zero sum game. It is not: if we cut corporate taxes somehow we are going to hurt education. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756742">In fact, it is to the contrary. If we reform the corporate tax system and reform taxes on investment, we create more economic growth, attract more capital, build greater productivity so that we can invest in social programs that can help to have a fairer and more just society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756743">For my friends in the Conservative Party, I would like to speak to the importance of social investment. The OECD is one of the greatest organizations in the world on economic policy. It advises on economic, fiscal and broad based social policy. One of the prescriptives that it recommended in its 2006 report on Canada included improving the overall business environment by reducing taxes on corporate investment, fostering innovation, and ensuring fiscal arrangements are efficient, but it also put in its economic recommendations for Canada that it should tackle disadvantage and strengthen social development. It pointed specifically to the importance of early learning and child care not simply as a social policy but as an economic policy. This is what the OECD had to say: </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756744">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Moving toward free early education for all three and four year-olds may also pay social and economic dividends in the longer run. This could be complemented by more affordable access to child care, especially for lower-wage working parents.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756745">Therefore, as much as the NDP members do not recognize the importance of forward thinking economic policy to create a more just society, the Conservatives do not recognize the importance of a more just society and better social programs to create a more vigorous economy. This leaves one party, the Liberal Party, that actually understands that we need good social investment to have a competitive economy and we need a competitive economy to be able to afford good social investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756746">That was the Liberal record in the 20th century but today the world has actually changed to the point that we recognize the need for environmental stewardship as a core mantra for public policy here in Canada and around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756747">A few months ago I attended a conference in Dalian, China. The World Economic Forum held for the first time in its 36 year history a summer Davos conference this year in China. At that conference the sessions included venture capital investment in clean tech, the growth of biofuels as an investment opportunity, and how to compete and succeed in a global carbon constrained economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756748">If one just looked at the topics and did not know the nature of the conference, one would think one was at a Greenpeace or a Sierra Club conference, but no, these were the top CEOs from around the world, of the biggest companies in the world, gathering to talk about why investments in clean technology were going to lead to greater profits for their companies.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="756749">Many of these CEOs were not necessarily that progressive a few years ago on environmental policy. They have come to the conclusion that whether or not one believes in the science of climate change, whether or not one supports Kyoto, a CEO has a vested interest, but also a pecuniary responsibility to the shareholders, to prepare his or her company for what is becoming a globally carbon constrained economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756750">Around the world, countries are individually, bilaterally and multilaterally putting a price on carbon because they recognize the importance of addressing the environmental mistakes of the past. As that occurs, environmental laggards will become economic laggards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756751">Canada has a huge capacity to compete and succeed in a globally carbon constrained economy if we put the right public policy measures in now. We need to not only reform our tax system to be more competitive in the short term, but in the long term we need to green our tax system. That means more than simply putting a price on carbon. That means putting in place incentives for consumers to invest in green technologies, to buy green technologies, and to basically make Canada not only a greener country but also more competitive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756752">One of the questions we should be asking ourselves is what tax reform, what economic reform, what policies should we be implementing as a country now to become a global leader in what will be the fastest growing area of the 21st century economy: the area of green tech, clean tech and environmental technologies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756753">Business leaders globally are ahead of governments on this and they are particularly ahead of this current government. I knew this government was not socially progressive. When I look at its budgets, I see it is not even economically conservative but, beyond that, the fact that it does not really take seriously environmental issues is actually creating an economic risk for Canada as other countries embrace environmental stewardship not only as a moral imperative but also as an economic opportunity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756754">Countries like Denmark are growing in fact because of past environmental responsibility and foresight to put in place the measures required to reduce carbon consumption, to reduce the environmental externalities of their economy. Today it is more competitive as a result of that foresight. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756755">I would urge the Conservatives to recognize that in fact environmental responsibility brings with it economic opportunity. I would urge the NDP to recognize that in fact environmental responsibility can create the economic opportunity but that corporate profits are not necessarily a bad thing. We need the market engaged and we need the private sector engaged. Government cannot do it alone. We need all members of Canadian society, through the tax system, to play a role and build a richer, fairer and greener Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756756">Liberals believe in making the long term decisions that are in the interests of Canadians and reducing personal and business income taxes. The Conservative government cut the GST to raise income taxes, particularly on the poorest of Canadians. We need to cut taxes particularly for low income Canadians. We need to reduce marginal income taxes and we need to help all Canadians, particularly middle class and low income Canadians, to have the opportunity to compete and succeed, which they deserve, and to see the benefits for their hard work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756757">The Conservative government is the only government in the world that is cutting consumption taxes to raise income taxes. It is wrong. It is going in the wrong direction. It is trying to buy votes and that is at the long term economic--</ParaText>

In fact, I would draw the member's attention to the cover of today's Report on Business if he is not completely aware of his own government's policies. The headline of today's <I>Globe and Mail</I> Report on Business is: “Tories rebuked on GST.

              <ParaText id="756769">Even the tax fighting Fraser Institute, that bastion of progressive social policy, says Ottawa should have other priorities like cutting personal income taxes, cutting corporate income tax, and making better investments in research and development. So it is not a question of whether I am aware of his government's economic policy, the question is really, is he aware of his own government's economic policy? </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="756771">Mr. Speaker, two days ago the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> stood in the House and said that he would continue the Liberal tradition of giving deep corporate tax cuts to the most profitable big corporations like the banks that have just made somewhere near $19 billion worth of profit last year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756772">In fact, the Liberals since 2000 have reduced the corporate tax rate from 28% to 21%. One would think that would help the manufacturing industry, but no, it did not. Why? Because the manufacturing industry already has a 21% rate. It did not help small businesses whatsoever. Why? Because small businesses only pay a 12% corporate tax rate anyway. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756773">Therefore, these huge corporate tax cuts during those years have actually had no impact on the manufacturing industry or small businesses which is one of the reasons why we see the manufacturing industry suffering right now. Over those 10 years we have seen close to $60 billion worth of tax revenue that this country has forgone and that is really shameful.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="756781">I rise today to address the motion presented by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78387" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation>. The motion of the member for Markham—Unionville starts off rather well; it is surprising, but it does start off rather well. As I was reading this motion over initially, I was actually rather proud of him, at the start. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756782">He advocates the lowering of taxes. This government, under the leadership of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>, has lowered taxes by a whopping $41 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756783">My colleague calls for a reduction of the debt. Our government has managed to pay down an astounding $27.4 billion in less than two years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756784">Also, and in a fashion that only a Liberal could in this place, he calls for increased funding for programs like education and infrastructure, but we all remember, and this is what makes this so striking, that his Liberal government was the one that gutted the social transfer in the early 1990s. The Liberals are the only ones in this House who have ever taken a penny from these important programs, and in doing so often have set federal-provincial relations so terribly back to dangerous levels.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756785">If the member does not believe me, maybe he should talk to some of his current Liberal colleagues, such as the Liberal member for <Affiliation DbId="78821" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation>, who once said that the Liberal government created a “tremendous vacuum in funding for universities throughout the country”, or the Liberal member for <Affiliation DbId="78625" Type="2">Newmarket—Aurora</Affiliation>, who remarked that it was the “lack of federal leadership that has made post-secondary education the poor second cousin in public policy and the country will pay a price for that lack of vision”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756786">Is that the proud Liberal record on supporting post-secondary education that the member is talking about? Under the Liberals, Canada, despite the hard work of its citizens, began lagging behind many nations in the world in social and economic categories. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756787">We are not making those mistakes. If the member opposite had read the budget or Advantage Canada, he would have seen that this government is involved in the most ambitious infrastructure initiative in Canada's history. It is no wonder the Canadian Urban Transit Association said our recent actions represented “welcome new investment in Canada's infrastructure”, or why the NDP premier of Manitoba, Gary Doer, called our infrastructure initiative “a very positive announcement”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756788">Under the Liberals' watch, the bridges became unsafe and the roadways were not maintained, yet they call upon this government to do even better. And that we are doing, and that is the best that can be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756789">That is rich, but from my hon. colleague's motion it is clear that he is unfamiliar with budget 2007 and Advantage Canada, so let us take some time to highlight some of the work our government is undertaking to provide Canadians with an entrepreneurial advantage, a knowledge advantage and an infrastructure advantage. Hopefully this will serve to enlighten and make sure none of my learned colleagues in this House make the mistake of supporting this motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756790">Last fall we launched a long term economic plan for Canada called Advantage Canada. It was designed to improve our quality of life and to make Canada a world leader for today and for future generations. Advantage Canada promotes five competitive economic advantages that we need in order to succeed in today's global economy: a fiscal advantage, a tax advantage, a knowledge advantage, an entrepreneurial advantage, and an infrastructure advantage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756791">I will talk about the last three advantages and how they help create the right conditions for Canadians and Canadian businesses and organizations to thrive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756792">Canada's entrepreneurial advantage is about putting in place the conditions for our businesses and entrepreneurs to invest, creating more and better jobs. This includes improving regulatory efficiency and reducing red tape and efforts to create a more competitive business environment. Strong and effective regulations safeguard Canadians and help preserve the environment. Overlapping regulations and unnecessary regulatory requirements put Canada at a competitive disadvantage. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="756793">We are committed to increasing market competition. A competitive marketplace meets the needs of consumers by providing them with more choices at lower prices. It also spurs investments by firms as they adjust to meet evolving consumer demands.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756794">On July 12, 2007 we launched an independent competition policy review panel. The panel is studying Canada's competition and investment policies and will report by June 2008 on how these policies could be strengthened, helping ensure that Canada is well positioned to compete globally and attract investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756795">We have also placed a priority on further strengthening Canada's economic union to better position our companies for success in the fiercely competitive global economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756796">We are also working to help create a knowledge advantage for Canada. First and foremost this means building the best educated, most skilled and flexible workforce in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756797">The government has taken action by introducing a new labour market training architecture that will help Canadians get the training and skills upgrading they need and that employers want. In particular, the government has allocated $500 million per year to address the gap in labour market programming for those who do not currently qualify for training under the employment insurance program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756798">Building a knowledge advantage also means creating more effective linkages between immigration and future labour market shortages. This is why in budget 2007 we invested $1.3 billion over five years to help improve the economic and social integration of immigrants. We are making it possible for foreign students trained in Canada and skilled temporary foreign workers to apply for permanent residence without leaving the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756799">Just as important, we are strengthening post-secondary education and making it more affordable for students and their families. We will increase support for post-secondary education by $800 million per year starting in 2008-09 through the Canada social transfer. This will bring total cash support for post-secondary education to $3.2 billion per year and it will grow by 3% per year thereafter. This significant increase in support will allow provinces and territories to invest according to their priorities in building a stronger and more affordable post-secondary system and ensure that it contributes to Canada's future economic success. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756800">We are increasing by 1,000 the number of scholarships available to our best graduate students so that they can acquire the advanced skills so important to our companies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756801">To compete and win in the global economy, Canada must also be a leader in generating and applying new knowledge, research and technologies. This is why we have released a comprehensive science and technology strategy. The strategy recognizes the important contribution that all sectors of Canadian society can make by creating and using knowledge to address challenges and pursue new opportunities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756802">Canada is starting from a strong foundation of knowledge. For example, we are the G-7 leader in terms of research taking place in our public sector as a share of our economy. The strategy commits to maintaining this leadership position and building on it to create economic and social benefits for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756803">In budget 2007 the government put in place significant investments to strengthen our capacity for world leading research and translate it into competitive advantage. In particular, we have provided $350 million over three years to support centres of excellence in commercialization and research. These centres place Canada at the leading edge in key areas of research, including health, energy, the environment and information communications technologies. Together these measures will help ensure that Canada has the skilled workforce and the supply of new ideas necessary to compete in the rapidly changing global economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756804">Through our building Canada plan we are taking decisive action in order to create an infrastructure advantage. This includes a federal investment of $33 billion in Canada's infrastructure, an unprecedented amount.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="756805">The significant stable and predictable funding for municipal infrastructure is being provided through an extended gas tax fund and maintaining the increased rebate in the goods and services tax that municipalities pay. The government is moving forward on implementing its infrastructure initiatives quickly in cooperation with provinces and territories. This is paving the way toward realization of key infrastructure projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756806">As we can see, today's motion is based on such a flawed premise that the government will not be able to support it.

              <ParaText id="756813">We talk about the benefits that we have provided. Certainly this government wants to talk a lot about cutting taxes. It is very important. It is a message I hear from my constituents every time I go home. But I also hear from the seniors that they are happy that we have been able to provide benefits to seniors. The working families tax removed 230,000 low income earners from the tax rolls. That is a tax relief benefit to them, but it gives them more money to stimulate the economy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="756814">Mr. Speaker, the danger of practising retail politics à la Conservatives is that they are only looking at the immediate situation that the country faces and they lack the foresight to address key issues like skills shortages as well as Canada's aging society. Nothing illustrates that more than the lack of understanding the government has in reference to immigration. Statistics show that within the next 20 years, immigration will account for all of Canada's net labour force and population growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756815">The question I have for the hon. member, who I know cares about the future of Canada, is why has the government reduced spending on foreign credential recognition by $145 million when immigration is such an important element of any future strategy of a G-7 country?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="756821">Mr. Speaker, I thank the <Affiliation DbId="113996" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance</Affiliation> for sharing his time with me and congratulate him on his new role. I know he will do a fantastic job in that office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756822">I welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion of the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78387" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756823">At the outset, it is important to acknowledge my colleague's recognition of our government's efforts to lessen the tax burden on Canadian families, individuals and businesses. His motion correctly highlights that we have significantly reduced both personal and corporate taxes, as well as the national debt, in order to increase the competitiveness of Canada's economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756824">Clearly, as an economist by training, he has a fine eye for effective economic policy. We appreciate his support and trust that there may well be others across the aisle who share his views but are somewhat resistant to be overly positive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756825">Accordingly I will take a little time today to reiterate what we have done so far on both tax and on the debt side of the ledger, with the hope that others might find the courage exhibited by my friend opposite to speak positively and publicly about the government's accomplishments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756826">It would appear, given the second portion of the motion, that the member for <Affiliation DbId="78387" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation> may be unaware of the positive work we have done with respect to investing in infrastructure, post-secondary education and so on. Therefore, I also will take some time to address what we have done in these areas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756827">With respect to reducing taxes, our credentials are solid and have been from the moment we assumed office. We have provided more than $41 billion over three years in tax relief for individuals and businesses. As the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> has noted often, there is more still to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756828">We will build on the efforts and continue to create a tax advantage for Canada, which will fuel economic growth, investment and the creation of wealth. It started less than 18 months ago, in May 2006, with the 2006 federal budget. For those who have not read it, I have it here with me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756829">The document proposed 29 personal and business tax relief measures that provided more than $20 billion of personal tax relief alone. That sum, which represents more than the four previous federal budgets combined, helps me to better understand the praise of my friend of whom I referred to earlier. Clearly, he probably wishes that the previous government had taken similar action on behalf of Canadian taxpayers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756830">For example, he no doubt recognizes the wisdom of providing tax relief for each and every working Canadian through the introduction of the Canadian employment credit. I say this with all sincerity, who can argue with providing a tax credit to recognize the cost of work related expenditures such as home computers, uniforms and supplies? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756831">Similarly, who among us would oppose the creation of the children's fitness tax credit as a means to encourage healthy, active kids by helping to cover the eligible fees up to $500 for enrolment in physical activity programs? Who would oppose the new textbook credit for students to help offset the cost of textbooks? Who would oppose increasing the basic personal amount that an individual can earn every year before paying federal income tax? Who would oppose a 1% point reduction in the GST that benefits all Canadians, including those who do not earn enough to pay personal income tax?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756832">Who, one may ask? That would be the members of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition. That would be the same party that opposed the government's fair tax credit plan, a plan proposed with significant measures to help Canadian seniors. As hard as it is to believe, the Liberals opposed tax fairness. In doing so, that means they are opposing helping Canadian seniors plan for a better retirement through an increase in the age credit amount and the historic action of permitting income splitting for Canadian pensioners. Frankly, it is very hard to fathom.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="756833">It should therefore not be so hard to believe that the same group of folks has not supported the long term plan to build a strong economy for Canadians, “Advantage Canada”, by creating key advantages, including a tax advantage that would set Canada apart from our competitors around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756834">Maybe it is a little hard to believe that Liberal members are opposed to creating a tax advantage for Canada to help us attract and maintain the workers and the capital investment that Canada requires to succeed and prosper in the 21st century.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756835">Maybe it is a little hard to believe that Liberal members oppose a tax advantage that is fiscally responsible and that will build a stronger Canada and help to improve the quality of life for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756836">It is also hard to believe, at least for those of us on this side of the House, that responsible people could oppose the creation of other key advantages envisioned under “Advantage Canada”, a fiscal advantage, an entrepreneurial advantage, a knowledge advantage and an infrastructure advantage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756837">How else are we to explain that at the first opportunity they had to show their support toward creating comprehensive advantages for Canada, the vote on Bill <Document DbId="2801101" Type="3">C-52</Document> in the last session, Liberals said nay. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756838">Those members said nay to the creation of the tax back guarantee, through which all interest savings from the reduction of national debt would be returned to taxpayers in the form of income tax redemptions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756839">Liberals said nay to the working families tax plan and the creation of a $2,000 child tax credit that would provide up to $310 per child of tax relief to more than three million Canadian families starting this year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756840">Liberals said nay to increasing spousal and other deductions in order to provide up to $209 in tax relief starting this year for a supporting spouse or a single taxpayer who was supporting a child or relative. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756841">Liberals said nay to reducing the general corporate tax rate by 0.5% effective January 1, 2011.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756842">Liberals said nay to establishing a federal foreign convention and tourism incentive program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756843">Liberals said nay to the introduction of the green levy on inefficient fuel vehicles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756844">Liberals said nay to predictable long term funding to the Canada social transfer to support post-secondary education, social assistance and social services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756845">I could go on, but I trust the general idea that I am trying to put forward here is very clear to everybody in the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756846">The fact is the opposition tries to make all the right sounds and hit all the right buttons about lowering taxes, increasing productivity, investing in infrastructure and R and D, but when it comes to actually doing something about it and following through and doing the right thing, those members abdicate. It hardly inspires confidence in Canadians that they will actually do the right thing when they next get a chance. Let us hope that is many years away.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756847">However, given the wording of the motion before us today, I am willing to give the opposition the benefit of the doubt. Soon the government will introduce the 2007 budget implementation bill. Members opposite will have the opportunity to walk the walk or talk the talk. They will be able to tangibly demonstrate that they mean business by voting yea and not nay to the tax measures that will benefit Canadians and help create the Canadian tax advantage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756848">For example, among other measures the Liberals can say yea to is the introduction of the working income tax benefit to help people who are out of work get back to work and over the welfare wall. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756849">Liberals could say yea to expanding the scope of the public transit credit to better encourage individuals to make a sustained commitment to public transit use.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756850"> Liberals could say yea to increasing the lifetime capital gains exemption to $750,000 to increase the rewards for investing in small business, fishing and farming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756851">I look forward to the pending debate on these important matters. I hope I am not wrong in giving the benefit of the doubt to my friends across the way.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="756871">Mr. Speaker, this is a rather unique situation. Yesterday, the Liberals did not rise when the time came to vote on the throne speech. No one got up. We did not know whether they supported or opposed the speech. We do not know because no one rose.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756872">Today, we have before us a motion that looks strangely like something the Conservative Party might have moved as the party claiming to be the alternative to the other government, but the two parties are cut from the same cloth. It is sad, but true about this Liberal motion, which is a little light on analysis. Here are some examples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756873">First, the motion says that the government must reduce taxes, but makes no mention of the fiscal imbalance or possible transfers to the provinces. The Liberals seem totally unaware that there is a will in this country, particularly in Quebec, to make sure money is transferred to the provinces and the fiscal imbalance is corrected once and for all. This financial issue was corrected in part in the most recent budget, but a significant part of the issue has yet to be addressed: the actual transfer of money, which includes ways of raising money and transferring it to Quebec so that it can carry out its responsibilities. The Liberals are silent on this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756874">They could have criticized the Conservatives, who have failed to finish the job and seem content with the monetary transfer, but do not go so far as to respect the recognition of Quebec as a distinct nation and eliminate the fiscal imbalance completely. On this point, the Liberals take more or less the same position as the Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756875">The same is true when it comes to reducing corporate taxes. I am very surprised. The Standing Committee on Industry issued a unanimous report with 22 recommendations that made one thing clear: the government should not make across-the-board corporate tax reductions, but targeted reductions. Why? Because some companies are making good profits from their economic activities, while others are earning much less. The manufacturing and forestry sectors are not turning a profit. If corporate taxes are reduced, the people in these sectors will not benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756876">We need to find ways to make targeted tax reductions, as the Standing Committee on Industry recommended. That means things like refundable research and development tax credits, loan guarantees and a series of measures that will create a favourable tax environment for Canadian companies so that they can compete on global markets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756877">If we reduce corporate taxes across the board without asking for anything in particular in return, the money will flow into the pockets of shareholders, who will continue to invest in what they believe is best for the company. There is a difference between the goals of corporations and the goals of the state. The Liberals and the Conservatives do not seem to be aware of this reality. However, their own members on the Standing Committee on Industry accepted the proposals and were involved in developing this global action plan to help the manufacturing industry that was applauded by the coalition of manufacturers and unions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756878">With regard to today's motion pertaining to productivity, we would have expected that this distinction be made, that recommendations different from the Conservative approach be made. But this is not the what we see with the Liberal's position.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756879">The issue of the debt is being handled in a similar manner. We are told that we must quite simply reduce the debt. However, there is significant debate surrounding this issue. This year, I conducted pre-budget consultations in my riding; I had six meetings of at least two hours each with citizens from all over the riding. I took away one thing from those meetings: what discouraged them the most was that $14 billion in surpluses was used to pay down the debt. It is somewhat similar to a home owner obsessed with paying the mortgage. He absolutely wants to pay off the mortgage on his house as soon as possible and in the least number of years possible. In the meantime, the porch is collapsing and he does nothing about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756880">That is the kind of problem we have in Canada. It is fine to use the surplus to pay off about half of our debt, but we have to reinvest the other half in infrastructure programs. We also have to ensure a more equitable distribution of wealth and implement a program to assist older workers who have been laid off due to globalization. These measures should be part of an overall industrial strategy.</ParaText>

              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="756882">The Liberal motion does not address that. Now that they are the official opposition, they seem to be ignoring the issue. How disappointing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756883">Today is the day after the vote on the Speech from the Throne. They abstained from voting. Nobody knows whether they were for it or against it, just that they decided not to vote. I would have preferred to see four or five members rise, symbolically, to say that their party was against it, but none of them rose yesterday. Today, they have introduced a motion in an attempt to condemn the government. Theirs is a motion that sits squarely on the fence. Most of what the motion contains could very well have been supported by the Conservatives, or even proposed by them when they were in opposition. Obviously, the Conservative government will have to vote against it because of some of the things it says, but those are just details, really.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756884">For example, the motion says that the government must avoid making mistakes such as breaking its promise not to tax income trusts. It is true that the Conservative's made the mistake of breaking their promise. They made a promise not to change the income trust tax, but they went ahead and changed it. Of course, when it came right down to it, that they clearly had to do something or income trusts would create very serious problems for the entire economy. We have to put this broken promise into context and in that sense, the motion generalizes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756885">The same goes for eliminating interest deductibility. The details have not been worked out. It seems to be the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>'s trademark to present ideas and then, once they are on the table, realize that there are some loose ends to tie up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756886">This was how he tackled the issue of automatic teller machines. One day, he said he was going to bring the banks back to their senses and the next day he had a meeting with them and said the status quo was not so bad. It was the same with retailers. He said we have to make sure prices come down faster; he has a meeting and says the market will sort this out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756887">The <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> is sending out the wrong message. We saw this same lack of real analysis on the issue of interest deductibility. Again, it is clear that the Liberals did not get to the heart of this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756888">This motion is unacceptable to us because it systematically attacks provincial responsibilities in a number of jurisdictions, namely: infrastructure, research and development, post-secondary education, assistance to immigrants, recognition of credentials, and labour force training. For the Liberals, this is business as usual.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756889"> A majority of those activities are under provincial jurisdiction. They want to continue interfering in these areas when we know that action could be taken. For example, the federal government has maintained a reserve in the employment insurance fund for labour force training. There has been some devolution to the provinces, but part of it has been retained for a number of administrative programs, and there is a reserve. This money could be made available to Quebec and the provinces so they could use it to address labour force training needs. We do not want to find ourselves in the somewhat absurd situation that is happening in Lebel-sur-Quévillon. They are looking for mine employees there. Right next door, there are dozens and dozens of forestry workers. The Fédération des travailleurs et travailleuses du Québec had asked that they be giving the appropriate training so they could become mine workers. No way of accomplishing this could be found, and we are going to bring in immigrants to do the work, while the forestry workers continue to be unemployed. There again, there is action that could be taken that was not taken and that should be taken.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756890"> So we are dealing with a motion that involves the level at which corporations are taxed and the size of the debt. It talks about driving greater productivity in Canada by making investments, but it gives no details about them, nor does it say what kind of action or what kind of policies should be put forward. This very general language makes no constructive contribution as compared to the position we would have expected from the Liberal Party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756891"> When we talk about better access to post-secondary education, we have known the recipe for a long time. We have to be sure that the money is in the provinces’ hands and that the federal government stops interfering, as it did under the Liberals’ reign with the millennium scholarships. Quebec has to be able to manage its own money for education and decide where it is going to spend it. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="756892"> That is the best way to improve access to post-secondary education. In fact, because of the loans and grants program we have developed in Quebec, which has unfortunately not been spared from the federal government’s budget cuts in this area, we still have an excellent system of access to training, and that must continue to be the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756893"> As well, the Liberal Party should have shown a little compassion in the way it worded this motion. It has nothing to say about older workers or workers on employment insurance, as if the question of productivity did not call for a little compassion; some is certainly required.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756894"> Earlier, I gave the example of older workers laid off by a company that is modernizing its plant. Often, those people have worked for 20 or 25 or 30 years for the same company. Until 1984, there was a program to help these people bridge the gap until retirement. Over and over, we have called for this kind of program to be put in place again. We succeeded in having an amendment to the Conservatives’ first throne speech passed, nearly two years ago now. We thought they would keep their word. They agreed to the amendment and they incorporated it, so that there would be a genuine assistance program for older workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756895"> In last year’s budget, rather than announcing the creation of the program, they decided to form a committee chaired by a former senator that was supposed to submit a draft report in September. When the end of summer arrived, we found out that the report had been postponed until January and still there is no program for older workers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756896"> I asked the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> about this following his address during consideration of the Speech from the Throne. There is a reality here that people are facing and they deserve a solution. I was a bit disappointed, though, because the Prime Minister did not seem to know what I was talking about, even though the manufacturing and forestry sectors in Quebec and Canada are currently experiencing major difficulties. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756897"> Western Canada may well be riding an economic boom, but the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> should also be aware of what is happening throughout the manufacturing sector, which accounts for between 15% and 20% of the economic activity in Canada. Some of our citizens are badly affected by these layoffs. Yet the Conservative government shows no compassion, nor do the Liberals for that matter, because the very next day after the vote on the throne speech, they have introduced a motion in which they decide to say nothing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756898"> It is the same with employment insurance. We have certainly put up a fight. I have been a member of Parliament for 14 years. Today is actually the anniversary of my election in 1993, and so it was exactly 14 years ago that I was elected to the House for the first time. We have been fighting hard for all that time. In truth, we would have preferred not to have to be here so long. I can humbly say that on the night of the referendum in 1995, I would have gone home, if we had only won. Today I would be living in a sovereign Quebec and would be very happy about it. In any case, we continued to fight and obtained some employment insurance pilot projects. These were not real changes to the act but five pilot projects that at least improved the situation of seasonal workers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756899"> By the way, one of these pilot projects will expire on December 9, 2007. It enables all seasonal workers in 21 regions of Canada to receive benefits for five additional weeks over and above what is usually provided in the tables. However, if the <Affiliation DbId="105827" Type="4">Minister of Human Resources and Social Development</Affiliation> fails to extend the current pilot project, the regular tables will come back into force on December 10. It is terrible for people in the seasonal industries to have a sword of Damocles like that hanging over their heads. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756900">In the past, we forced the Liberal government to take action on this issue. Who could forget that Mr. Chrétien called seasonal workers beer-drinkers? In the end, we got a special program for seasonal workers. Nevertheless, it is sad that this has not yet become entrenched in law and that we still do not have an independent employment insurance fund to stop the government from dipping into it. The government must take action to extend the pilot project beyond December 9. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756901">We are worried about the coming year. There has been a significant slowdown in manufacturing and seasonal industries. Furthermore, the rising Canadian dollar is having an adverse effect on tourism. In seasonal industries, people tend to work the minimum number of weeks to qualify for employment insurance.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="30">(1130)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="756902">People were going through an awful period of time known as the “spring gap”, when, for 4 to 10 weeks, they had no income left. After working 12, 15 or 16 weeks, they were entitled to the maximum number of weeks of benefits, but there was still a period of time during which they had no income. They had to resort to social assistance or cash in their retirement savings to support their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756903">The pilot project gave people five additional weeks of benefits. It is due to end on December 9, and we are waiting for the federal government to take action on this issue. I was hoping the Liberals would take the lead by including this in their motion. After all, a society is not judged solely on the money it makes, but on how its wealth is distributed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756904">This week, Canada learned that only too well. A UN representative told us that when it comes to social housing, Canada is a little like a banana republic. We in Canada are not doing a very good job of fighting poverty. We are not using the tools we should be using, such as the employment insurance system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756905">During the previous session, this Parliament was considering Bill <Document DbId="3073177" Type="4">C-269</Document>, a bill sponsored by a member of the Bloc Québécois. The bill remains before this Parliament still today, as a private members' bill. The three opposition parties are prepared to pass it. The government's decision to give royal recommendation is the only thing missing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756906">Passing the bill would mean profoundly changing the employment insurance system. It would correct the situation and provide justice to those who fought hardest against the deficit, through the 1990s and until today, namely, unemployed workers in Quebec and Canada. For they are the ones who paid Canada's deficit and, to date, the only ones who have not seen any return on their investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756907">We, on the other hand, have benefited from a few tax cuts and an improved economy. Unemployed workers are the ones who paid. The screws were tightened for 10 years. They were forced into a very precarious financial situation and nothing has been done to correct or improve that situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756908">If the Conservative government wanted to really do something to better fight poverty, it would give this bill royal recommendation. A precedent has already been set in this area, on a bill dealing with employment insurance. If it would only do so, people around the world would say that the Government of Canada took significant action to fight poverty and ensure a better distribution of wealth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756909">I would have liked to see the Liberals refer to this bill in their motion. Nevertheless, they supported it, as did the NDP. The Conservatives are the only ones at this time who refuse to breathe new life into this bill. This is not a question of encouraging people to become or to remain unemployed. That phase has been resolved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756910">Given the current employment rate, we have a problem of a different kind. What about the manufacturing jobs that were well paid? In my riding we see it every day. The $15, $16, $18 and $20 an hour jobs have become $8, $9 and $10 an hour jobs. Fortunately, inflation is not very high. However, in real life, this reduces economic activity in several regions. There is another way of dealing with this situation: we have to have a good employment insurance program enabling individuals, including older workers, to live decently until their retirement and allowing them to have a minimum to keep the economy rolling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756911">These programs were created for a reason. After the Great Depression—the economic crisis of the 1930s—we realized that we had to maintain the buying power of those who no longer had an income. The unemployment insurance program and the social assistance program were established to ensure that people would have a minimum to continue to live. Today, even though our overall economy is doing well because of the energy sector, those who struggle every day, who provide their labour in order to have an income and support their family, are waiting for a return on the investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756912">This is not reflected in the Liberal's motion, and even less so by the Conservative government, which is determined to continue claiming that no efforts are needed in this regard. The Conservatives have already said that they supported the independent employment insurance fund. Let them show it, let them agree to adopt Bill <Document DbId="3074835" Type="3">C-269</Document> and to give a royal recommendation. Then we will have a tangible measure to judge. Until then, Quebec wants nothing to with what the Liberals are doing today or what the Conservatives presented in the Speech from the Throne.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="756921">Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question. It will allow me to shed light on the situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756922">It is true that many jobs have been created in Canada, Quebec and Ontario. Nonetheless, one of the major problems is the disparity between the need for workers and the workers available. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756923">The government would like workers who are 57, 58, or 60, who were laid off after working in a plant for 25 years, to start working as computer technicians overnight. A few of them may manage that transition, but most will never be able to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756924">In a society where a federal government posts a $14 billion surplus at the end of the year, it is unacceptable to put all that money toward the debt. Some of that surplus should have been used to share the wealth with these workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756925">There is also the matter of the right number of available jobs. As far as immigration is concerned, we have to make sure there is a significant enough supply of workers moving here to meet the needs. I think a greater effort needs to be made in that area. There has to be a balance between the number of people we welcome and the needs that have to be met. More effort needs to be made on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756926">Another very difficult aspect of employment is that an employee might come from a job where he was earning $15, $16, $18, or $20 an hour only to start a new job where he is earning $8.50 or $9 an hour. To lose an $18-an-hour job to start another one at $9 an hour is not good for the employee or the economy of Quebec. Furthermore, this was criticized yesterday not by the Bloc Québécois, the Parti Québécois or the sovereignists in Quebec, but by Quebec's chambers of commerce. According to them, this is having a devastating impact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756927">We expect the Conservative government to introduce programs to give our businesses the tax framework they need to compete globally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756928">Finally, the hon. member said he thinks it is unfortunate that I am a separatist. Indeed, I wish there were two countries next to one another that could continue to live together. That would solve a whole host of problems and we could focus in the future on really allowing our society to create wealth and share it in a much better way than the federal Canadian system allows.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="756930">These days, there is a lot of talk about reducing taxes. Certain realities have to be taken into account, however: the widening gap between rich and poor Canadians; layoffs in the manufacturing sector; higher tuition fees, which leave students $20,000 to $40,000 in debt on graduation; the lack of a real national daycare system; increased poverty and waiting lists in our hospitals.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="756932">Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his wishes for the next 14 years but I would have preferred that he wished that Ms. Marois would become Premier of Quebec within the next year and that within a few years Quebec would become a sovereign country, while continuing to be good neighbours with Canada. Nevertheless, I thank him for his good wishes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756933"> To deal with his question, there are important choices to be made in Canada. If we decide only to reduce income taxes significantly, we run the risk of increasing consumption of goods from China or other emerging countries. I am not against that. However, if the direct effect of that is to transfer the Canadian surplus to China, perhaps we would be better to develop a more flexible structure, to help our companies to obtain tax credits through investments and other types of services of that kind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756934"> As far as child care is concerned, my colleague himself gave an example. In Quebec, we have developed a quality child care service that is the envy of all the provinces in Canada. We, and our colleagues from all other parties, would like to see this kind of child care in the rest of Canada. Nevertheless, if that were to happen, Quebec must be able to receive its share of the funding, full compensation, with no accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756935"> However, what we find in the Speech from the Throne is the opposite. According to that document, in terms of shared cost programs in areas of provincial jurisdiction, the federal government is entitled to give direction and Quebec must re-invest in the same sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756936"> In the area of children’s services, we already have a program that is well funded, and if we received funding from the federal government that would enable the program to work even better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756937"> Unfortunately, neither the Liberal motion tabled today, nor the attitude of the Conservatives, nor, indeed that of the NDP—who continue to believe that the federal government has the cure for all ills—will enable us to reach an agreement. On that score, there is work to be done. If Canada's federalists are people of good faith, they must understand that the best solution is to put the money in the right place and that Quebec must have the funds necessary for meeting its responsibilities. We want the sovereignty of Quebec to come quickly, but while we are waiting, since it remains part of Canada, it must receive its fair share.</ParaText>

Since my colleague was the longtime Bloc industry critic and is now finance critic, these issues are major concerns of his. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="756943">In fact, the spokesperson for Commonwealth Plywood, Joël Quévillon, explained that the current economic conditions, the market and the rising Canadian dollar are the main reasons they have suspended operations.</ParaText>

It can still do so, using the action plan for the forestry industry that was put forward by the Bloc Québécois. The plan contains concrete measures which would give our companies the necessary fiscal tools to be competitive. Then our companies could compete on the world stage.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="756945">Mr. Speaker, I am sharing my time today with my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78675" Type="2">London—Fanshawe</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756946">It is unfortunate that the motion before us today misses the mark at a time when our manufacturing sector is in such a crisis. My colleagues from the Bloc have been describing the impact of this crisis in Quebec. It is at a time when our Canadian dollar has appreciated by 60% over the last five years in addition to high energy costs and fierce global competition. Frankly, I have trouble distinguishing between the approach of the government that got us into this crisis and the approach of the opposition with the motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756947">Corporate across the board tax cuts, such as are being proposed or affirmed with the motion, simply are not needed and they rob the public purse of much needed revenue. Today the banking industry, for example, is making record profits. The last I read it was something like $16 billion. This is at a time when the average person still gets dinged every time he or she goes to the bank with high ATM fees, about which the government has done nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756948">It makes no sense to give tax cuts to oil and gas companies, banks and insurance companies with no strings attached. Surely we should not be subsidizing highly profitable industries that are largely insulated from international competition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756949">The corporate tax cuts of recent years have not led to increased corporate investment, in spite of many arguments to the contrary. Therefore, why should the average taxpayer be subsidizing tax cuts to highly profitable industries that are insulated from competition and thereby forgo billions and billions of dollars of federal tax revenue? This revenue is so desperately needed and should be invested in our communities for services and infrastructure across our country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756950">There already have been significant corporate tax cuts over the last several years. In 2000 there was a corporate income tax rate cut from 28% to 21% to be achieved by 2004. This was a huge tax cut, but it provided no savings for manufacturing because it had already reached that level. This is the one sector that continues to need protection from international competition. Thousands of manufacturing jobs continue to leave Canada and all the Conservative government and the absent opposition propose is another series of tax cuts that simply have not worked. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756951">Those members pay no attention to the crisis in manufacturing. There is no strategy for the manufacturing sector, or the auto sector, or shipbuilding, or the many other Canadian industries, which are thrown into unfair competition because of the factors I earlier described. Yet these tax cuts cost Canadians billions and billions of dollars in lost revenue, from about $5.4 billion in 2004, now up to over $7 billion a year. Our corporate tax levels are not particularly high. One study I saw put them at the third lowest in the G-8.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756952"> The other problem is those members are affirming the GST cut in the throne speech, and the government will go ahead with it. The last thing we need to be doing right now is stimulating consumer spending when consumer spending is already quite high. The fear is this kind of increase will drive up interest rates and therefore be counterproductive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756953">I do not support the GST cut. What it will mean is that if a millionaire wants to buy a $100,000 Porsche, he or she would get a nice $1,000 tax break. However, a family that puts some money together and spends $500 on a new dining room set saves a measly $5. Those families would need to spend $10,000 in order to save a measly $100. The GST cut is not a solution. With that cut, which all economists agree is not the way to go, we will lose $5 billion in revenue, basically subsidizing the Porsches and the Ferraris. It could have been spent differently.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="55">(1155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="756954">One of the many letters I have received from constituents talks about the desperate need for investment in our cities and in the services Canadians need. I get many letters calling for a national housing strategy and for investments in infrastructure, especially in transit and in water infrastructure, and also in our social infrastructure to ensure that our kids get the best start possible, that working people have the best chance to adjust to a changing economy, and that seniors and people with disabilities get the best care possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756955">I believe the motion is contradictory. It calls for reinvestment in physical infrastructure, new technology, R and D, better access to post-secondary education, et cetera. Where is the money going to come from? From giving tax cuts to companies that do not need it? It makes no sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756956">The Conservatives are taking Canada in the wrong direction. We saw in the throne speech that their direction will increase inequality and the prosperity gap. Middle class families will see their debt rise and their children's future narrow. We are already finding the quality of life in our largest cities diminished. They ought to be engines of the economy and hubs for cultural, economic and environmental excellence and yet we find our cities boxed in at every turn, neglected and underfunded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756957">It is sad, then, that the Liberals have abandoned their role of opposition. Last night on the vote on the throne speech, they sat in their seats motionless, mute and, frankly, muddled. At a time when we see the need so high among citizens across our country, I would like the opposition to tell the 70,000 families on the waiting list for subsidized housing in the city of Toronto, or the students who are seeing tens of thousands of dollars in debt pile up on their backs before they even get a start in life, or the people in our city who are stuck in gridlock with air that is increasingly polluted from the lack of transit, that the Liberals could not be bothered to stand in their places and vote in the interests of all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756958">I believe Canadians are looking for real leadership. They want a government that speaks to their interests. They are tired of political self-interest trumping the interests of Canadians. Corporate tax cuts and cuts to the GST limit our ability to make progress as a country. They take us in the wrong direction. I am very proud that our caucus stood opposed to that direction. We will continue to stand up for the principles and represent the interests that are to the benefit of the vast majority of Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="756959">Mr. Speaker, of course the member will know that I disagree with her on virtually every point she has made. In fact, she refers to Canada going in the wrong direction under our Conservative government, but Canada has never had economic fundamentals as strong as they are today. We have record low unemployment rates, the lowest unemployment rates in the last 33 years. We have the strongest economic fundamentals of the G-8 nations. We have an incredibly robust economy. As well, we are repaying Canada's debt, which is long overdue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756960">However, there is one thing the member and I do have in common: we agree on the shameful performance of the Liberal Party in this House last night.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756961"> Liberal members of the House were elected to represent their constituents and to vote, to make decisions, to say yes or no to the various policies we bring forward. Last night we were voting on the throne speech and the direction our government wants to take. What did the Liberals do? They simply sat on their duffs. That is irresponsible. It was a shameful performance. I would ask the member who just spoke to comment on whether she approves of that performance or whether she expects members of the House to stand up, vote and have the courage of their convictions.</ParaText>

I made the point that we are elected to stand here and vote in our places and act in the best interests of Canadians, but I do want to challenge the member on his rose-coloured glasses approach to Canada's economy. The numbers simply do not tell the full story. How can we say our economy is in great shape when the people in it, in many cases, are not doing very well at all?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756963">In my city of Toronto we have more than one million working people who make less than $10 an hour and therefore are below the poverty level. Tell me that is economic success.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756964"> Yes, our national debt is being reduced but quite frankly that debt is being transferred on the backs of average hard-working Canadians. Families have a higher level of debt than ever before. In the long term, it is not sustainable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756965">What is most shameful is to see young people starting out at the very beginning of their adult lives saddled with tens of thousands of dollars of debt in post-secondary education costs at a time when they should be free of that kind of fear, worry and insecurity. They are starting out in their lives unable to have the confidence to embark on their careers, to establish a family and to look forward to many working years.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="756972">Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by thanking my colleague from Parkdale--High Park for splitting her time with me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756973">The Liberal motion pretends to be a proposal to drive greater productivity in the Canadian economy, but it does not go anywhere near far enough. Like the Conservatives' recent throne speech, the motion actually misses the mark entirely. There are far too many Canadians being left behind. Nothing in the motion is going to address the seriousness of the prosperity gap, the deep divide between those who have and those who have not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756974">The reality is that if the poorest and the most disadvantaged are supported, the whole community benefits. Everyone thrives. So does the economy. We need to close the prosperity gap. Only then will we be able to grow as a country and a community, neighbourhood by neighbourhood.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756975">I would like to point out that the first step to increasing productivity would be to raise the minimum wage. The federal minimum wage was eliminated in 1996 under the Liberal government. This created real affordability problems for Canadians. Research conducted by the Canadian Labour Congress has revealed that a single person working full time in Canada needs an hourly rate of at least $10 an hour to reach the poverty line. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756976">Initially, a minimum wage was introduced to ensure that anyone working would not be subjected to a life of poverty. Sadly and unacceptably, in most provinces the minimum wage is so low that even someone working full time for the entire year falls far short of this poverty line--far short.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756977">The low level of the minimum wage is a key factor in the high rates of poverty in Canada and the persistently high levels of economic inequality. According to the latest data from the National Council of Welfare, almost 5 million Canadians, including 1.2 million children, were living in poverty in 2003.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756978">The NDP has proposed raising the federal minimum wage to $10 an hour to help alleviate some of the stress on today's working families. Let us imagine the inequity of a $13.5 billion surplus and 1.2 million children living in poverty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756979">I would like to focus on those children. Greater prosperity for our nation should include greater prosperity for our children. It is well known that good health and a good education when children are young give them an advantage in life when they are older. The research clearly shows that they will more likely be productive members of the community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756980">Today's motion does not include helping children who are living in poverty now. We need to invest in our children. We need access to quality, affordable child care. We need to invest in our schools. If the Liberals are serious about improving productivity, I hope they will vote in favour of the NDP child care bill when it comes up for a vote in the next few weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756981">While the motion does mention post-secondary education, and I agree that increased access to post-secondary education is key to increasing productivity, I am astounded to see that the Liberals are proposing this. It was while they had successive majority governments and successive surpluses that the cost of post-secondary education increased substantially. They had 13 years to keep the costs to students under control and to increase access to education. Instead, they let the costs skyrocket and left many young people unable to afford schooling that would give them the advantage in our highly competitive economy and allow them to make the contribution to our communities that they wish to make.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756982">This Liberal motion to improve productivity, as with the Conservative throne speech, also leaves out any mention of affordable housing. If one does not have a home it is almost impossible to find a job, organize one's life or receive social assistance. An address is absolutely essential to survival in this country. More than 1.7 million households live on less than $20,000 a year and most of these Canadians are precariously housed. They do not own their homes and spend far more than 30% of their income on rent. This is money that is unavailable for food, prescriptions, school supplies, kids' clothes, transportation and senior care.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="05">(1205)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="756983">Guaranteed access to safe and affordable housing will go a long way to making many Canadians more productive. Affordable housing will also help families with children who struggle just to make ends meet, who struggle every day with the choice between rent or food. If we dedicate just 1% of Canada's gross domestic product to eradicating homelessness in this country, we will be able to provide the homes Canadians deserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756984">I also need to point out that missing from this motion, and I might add glaringly missing from the throne speech, is 51% of the Canadian population. The poverty rate of single women is a staggering 42% and it is worse for single mothers at 48%. The average yearly wage for a full time worker living in poverty is $9,522. One person cannot live on $9,522 a year. That is less than $800 a month. That will barely cover rent in most cities never mind food. How can anyone raise a family on that? Many single mothers are forced to make ends meet with a shoestring budget such as this. They are told that this kind of desperation is as good as it gets, as good as it gets in a country with a $13.5 billion surplus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756985">In 2004, 394,800 women were working for minimum wage. That is 64% of minimum wage earners. The tragic thing is that women who are first nations or visible minorities have it even worse. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756986">From the Statistics Canada report “Women in Canada” published in 2005, the poverty rates are staggering. Of visible minority women under the age of 15, 33% of them live in poverty and it is even higher for aboriginal women compared to women in general at 15.9%. That is unconscionable. If we look at the age group 25 to 44, the number of visible minority women living in poverty is at 29% compared to the general population at 14%. That is double the general rate. In total, 28.8% of visible minority women are living in poverty in this country. That is unbelievable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756987">This motion to increase productivity will do nothing to help our women. It is short-sighted and it is unacceptable. This motion, and again the throne speech, fall far short. They fail to address the needs of everyone, and that includes seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756988">One-third of Canadians between the ages of 45 and 59 feel that they are not prepared financially for retirement. These concerns are most prevalent among women, those widowed, separated or divorced, recent immigrants, tenants, those without private pension coverage, and not surprisingly, those with low wages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756989">Of particular note are senior women who often end their lives living in poverty for many reasons. Women's unpaid work makes their risk of poverty higher and results in less access to private pensions. Older women tend to have lower incomes because they live longer, which leaves them at greater risk of using up their savings as time goes by. Immigrant women are particularly vulnerable. Many over the age of 65 who lived in Canada for less than 10 years are without any income at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756990">Senior women receive smaller pension incomes because of the wage difference between men and women. Most divorced women do not claim a portion of their former spouse's pension even though they are entitled to it. Many retirement plans do not compensate for absences to raise children or look after sick relatives, absences which are generally taken by women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756991">It is very important to emphasize here that senior women living in poverty did not end up there the day they retired. It is the poverty in their youth or the near poverty that prevented them from setting aside money for retirement. That is the real source of the problem. This motion will not come anywhere near addressing this problem. In fact, it ignores it outright, leaving the poverty cycle to continue for another generation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756992">If we continue to ignore the growing prosperity gap, we will never increase our national productivity. As long as people are left behind in poverty or near poverty, our whole country will suffer. By making sure that we look after those who are most in need, we can ensure that they will be productive and active members of our society. We can ensure a stronger community, stronger children and better conditions. We must allow people to live in the dignity they deserve. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="756993">This is truly what we want for Canada. It is what people deserve. It is what the people of London--Fanshawe deserve. We will all benefit. Our country and our communities will all benefit.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="757005">Mr. Speaker, one thing the member did not spend a lot of time on, and it is the one area of our throne speech that clearly benefits the poor in Canada, is the reduction of the GST by another 1%. As she knows, the GST is the one tax in Canada that when it is reduced, it benefits all Canadians, not just those that pay income tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757006">If the member had listened to the comments coming from the Liberal benches, they of course attacked our government for reducing the GST. They believe it is the wrong way to go. They believe in corporate tax cuts. They believe in focusing on the rich in Canada and giving them tax breaks, but not extending tax breaks to the poor, the working poor, students and seniors. They basically want to cozy up to their rich friends, their corporate buddies. That is something our government will not do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757007">My question is, what is her opinion of the Liberal approach to reducing taxes, as opposed to a 1% reduction in the GST?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="757011">It is very productive for us in this House to debate the motion being put forward by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78387" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757012">I certainly enjoyed the discussions from the New Democratic Party as its members continue to present themselves as the opposition to the opposition and from the Conservative Party as the Conservative Party enters the winter of discontent by Canadians of its particular policies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757013">As we embark on a discussion about where the country needs to go, I will preface my own comments by stating that never was there a greater time or need for the Government of Canada to step in and to support and strengthen the economy of all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757014">Just recently in the city of Corner Brook, Newfoundland and Labrador, a very large employer was forced to shut down a paper-making machine with a reduction of over 100 employees within the mill gate and several hundred others outside the mill gate. Its chief concern was of course not only the Canadian dollar and the high price of oil but, as well, its ability to either generate and produce cheap, clean electricity. Currently, it is forced to buy up to 30% of its power off the grid, most of that being generated at the Holyrood diesel generation plant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757015">I know that this company would certainly appreciate and could use beneficially any assistance to enable it to produce cheap, clean wind power, and I will be exploring that with this House on another day the need for government intervention because, of course, we are capable of that intervention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757016">Over the last 24-month period, due to the sound, strong economic performance of Canada, the foundations of which were laid by the Liberal government, we were able to generate $26 billion in surplus revenue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757017">Now if the Liberal Party of Canada and its platform and its governance model were still in place, $13 billion would have gone toward social and economic programming, with $13 billion being applied to the debt, instead of the straight rigid A meets B formula of all 100% being established toward the national debt, which has been put forward by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757018">If we look at this very tangibly, there are industrial sectors in this country that are truly in need of public infrastructure investments which all companies and all sectors of the economy could avail themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757019">Look at what happened just recently in Washington. We had the Governor of the Bank of Canada going down to the U.S. to basically plead the case that the structure of the Canadian economy was in such a state that the high value of the Canadian dollar was not warranted by the money traders. He actually made the case that the Canadian economy was not as vibrant as what was being suggested by money traders and in so making that argument, the Canadian dollar immediately went down by 1.5¢.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757020">If the Governor of the Bank of Canada is down in Washington saying that the very nature of the structure of the Canadian economy does not have sound fundamentals then, clearly, what we need to do is to deal with that issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757021">There was an opportunity here and an option that could have been supported by the government to invest in key government sectors, such as the forest products industry, and the manufacturing sector generally. It failed to do this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757022"> As a result, we are seeing layoffs right across this entire country in our manufacturing sector. That is a shame, especially at a time when, as they age, infrastructure in our cities needs to be replaced and expanded to meet changing population demographics. Yet, we are seeing no specific response to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757023">In fact, the response that we are receiving from the government is that the government should disenfranchise itself from the provinces. That, quite frankly, is irresponsible, especially when it comes to the cities and their needs and communities right across this entire country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757024"> I know that Canadians were certainly very optimistic as to where exactly this country was going, but I sense day after day, as each and every day passes, that there is a growing uncertainty about where exactly this country is going. Canadians see a federal government disenfranchising itself from their communities, from their own lives and from their provinces.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="757025">Newfoundland and Labrador is a perfect example. A promise was made that 100% of non-renewable natural resources would be excluded from the equalization formula, with no reference to any caps being imposed on the calculation of that formula by another province in its own fiscal performance. What did we see? We saw $11 billion drained from the public purse of the people and the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador as a result of that broken promise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757026">That is a lot of nurses, physiotherapists, nurse practitioners, doctors and other health care professionals who could have been supported and engaged in public service had that promise been kept. That is an awful lot of bridges, roads, water and sewer systems, and other green infrastructure that is now gone because that promise was broken.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757027">We have some very serious concerns about this. We have a tremendous economic opportunity in front of us if we invest wisely. The decisions of the Government of Canada not to do so are causing pause and concern for every Canadian. I too share in that failing optimism for the future of our communities, simply because we are in a moment of time in our history when never have we been blessed with so much but have done so little with it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757028">It is time now for the NDP not to simply become the opposition to the opposition. It is time for the Government of Canada to govern responsibly and to engage all people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757029"> I will tell members what is most vexing to the people of Newfoundland and Labrador. When the promise was made on the equalization formula and then broken, the excuse that was given was that the government could not fulfill the promise because it did not have the consent of the provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757030">It was a promise that was made by the government when it was in opposition. It was put in writing on January 4, 2006, to the Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, but it was also put in writing to each and every premier of this federation on January 15 in an open letter to the Council of the Federation, and yet the promise was broken and $11 billion was retracted from one particular province, Newfoundland and Labrador. Several other billion dollars were retracted from Nova Scotia. Saskatchewan now has a lawsuit in front of the federal government trying to get it to honour its promise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757031">When we look at those kinds of provocative statements coming forward, that antagonistic position, it is no wonder there is often a time when people simply sit back and reflect on whether we are going in the right direction as a country. The answer they come to is no. They want a country in which the federation supports each other and builds on its own strength but, most important, they want a government that is prepared to listen and talk to each member of the federation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757032"> We have not had a first ministers meeting to talk about critical infrastructure needs, health care needs and post-secondary education needs since the government took office. There has never been a first ministers conference and yet the government, when it stands in this House to deliver a budget, actually has the audacity to claim that the days of federal-provincial bickering are now over. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757033">When we have one province suing the federal government over a broken promise, three provinces engaged in a fair share campaign against the federal government and a fellow Conservative premier who is actually engaging in an ABC campaign, anything but Conservative, we are led to believe that the strength of the federation has supposedly never been better. Quite frankly, it is wrong and it is wrong by the test of any reasonable person. When we look at what is really happening with our federal-provincial relations, it is just not happening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757034"> We have never been blessed with so much and had a government do so little with it. We have had $26 billion in annual surpluses that could have been invested, at the advice of the Governor of the Bank of Canada, to revitalize our critical industry sectors and promote jobs, but the Government of Canada did not do it. It chose simply to go in a linear action without responding to those fundamentals and, quite frankly, I think the winter of discontent is on its way.</ParaText>

We have done so much over just 20 short months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757037">However, to get back to the motion, we have also reduced taxes. We have reduced taxes in every way that the federal government collects taxes: lower taxes for students, lower taxes for seniors, lower taxes for working families and lower taxes for corporations and businesses. There have been $41 billion in tax reductions and we are just getting started.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757038">I am glad the member for <Affiliation DbId="78387" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation> is now starting to pontificate about tax reductions. It is about time because this party has been saying for a long time that Canadians pay too much tax. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="757044">That said, I will agree with him that the government has not lowered taxes because it has been a thinly disguised veil that it has put over the Income Tax Act. Every Canadian who filled out a tax form in 2005 knows that his or her marginal tax rate on the lowest bracket was indeed 15%. Every Canadian who filled out a tax form in 2006 knows that his or her marginal tax rate for the lowest income tax bracket was 15.25%, an increase. In fact, the Government of Canada, the Conservative government, increased the taxes of every Canadian.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757045">In 2005, the marginal tax bracket rate was 15%, put in place by the Liberal government, and then, in 2006, it went to 15.25%, an increase, effective July 1, 2006, of half a percentage point. Half a percentage point is how much the taxes went up and that is exactly what will be filled out on this year's tax form.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="757055">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to a very important motion on behalf of my constituents of <Affiliation DbId="78612" Type="2">Brampton—Springdale</Affiliation> and many other Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757056">The motion talks about investing in Canada's future, investing in new Canadians and in their skills and qualifications, investing in research and development , investing in our young people and, most important perhaps, investing in our children, the future of our country and the future of our society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757057">It is unfortunate that we have seen, both from the Speech from the Throne and the previous government's track record, that despite our economic prosperity and our success within the international arena, we have failed to invest in our future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757058">When we look at our economic performance as a country, we realize that we have one of the best track records in the G-7. We are one of the ninth largest economies on the planet. Our provinces continue to produce a fiscal surplus and unemployment is at a 30-year low. We have that track record due to the tremendous fiscal management of Liberal governments. We have that track record because the former Liberal government had a vision for all Canadians, regardless of where they came from in the world and regardless of their socio-economic status. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757059">Despite all the glowing successes I have spoken about in terms of our economic productivity and our economic track record, perhaps what is most discouraging is the fact that the gap between the rich and the poor has continued to grow. Despite our economic success and our economic growth, at a point in time when the gap should be getting smaller, the gap is actually increasing. It has grown faster in the last decade than at any point in time in the last 30 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757060">In 2004, the richest 10% of Canadian families who raised children under the age of 18 actually earned 82 times more than the poorest 10% of our population. When we look at the facts, we see that the majority of Canadians, over 80%, are actually getting a smaller share of the economy that they help generate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757061">The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives has done a tremendous amount of work looking at alternatives for actually close the gap between the rich and the poor. That is why it is so important for this particular motion. The fact is that the average pay of the top 100 CEOs in Canada actually increased from $3.5 million to $9 million between 1998 and 2005, a 262% increase.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757062">One wonders what the average wage is in Canada. Wages actually increased between 1998 and 2005 from $32,000 to $38,000. While the CEOs had a 262% increase, the average worker only had an 18% increase. The gap is growing and it is growing quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757063">That is why it is so important that the motion is about investing, about closing the gap and about ensuring that the over half a million seniors and the over one million children living in poverty do so no more. However, for that to happen, we need to have a government with a vision, a government that is committed to closing that gap and a government that is committed to investing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757064">It was quite interesting when the government spoke about reducing the GST. If the Conservatives had done the math, they would have realized that the proposed cut of 1% on the GST would have resulted in every child in Canada between the ages of three and six having access to a child care space.</ParaText>

These agreements would have provided children and families with an opportunity to invest in early learning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757068">This hostility and the federal spending power mechanism that he speaks about will jeopardize medicare. It will continue to jeopardize national programs, like child care, which are of prime importance to Canadian families.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="757071">It goes on to talk about the fact that the government has also given out $1,200 to Canadian families for child care. However, that $1,200, broken down to $100 a month, is taxable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757072">Therefore, parents have been left with almost $60 a month. They have been left to fend for themselves. This is why the gap in our country continues to grow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757073">We talk about the fact that the government committed to producing child care spaces, 125,000 of them, but yet again it is another broken promise. When we look at this today, October 2007, not a single child care space has been produced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757074">Under the previous Liberal government, early learning and child care agreements were reached with all 10 provinces and would have ensured quality, universal, accessible and affordable child care for all Canadian families. Instead, parents and families are being left to fend for themselves. Mothers or fathers, who may want to participate in the workforce, have been denied that opportunity because they are unable to find access to a child care space.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757075">I take a look at my own riding of <Affiliation DbId="78612" Type="2">Brampton—Springdale</Affiliation>. I meet with constituents on a regular basis. They have been unable to find access to quality child care. Unfortunately, despite our many surpluses, we are failing to invest in children and in early learning and child care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757076">We have to ask ourselves this. If those agreements had not been cut by the government, every riding would have had access to over 266 additional early learning and child care spaces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757077">All of us have read the research. Study after study has concluded that a good start in life gives children a leg up, regardless of their family socio-economic status. Positive early experiences will help children build self-esteem, confidence, physical and emotional well-being and have the ability to cooperate and socialize.</ParaText>

Why is this happening in an era prosperity, growth, success and surplus at the federal level? All the money the government is trying to save right now is going to be spent on guns, gangs and violence. We need to invest in our children and we need to do it now. That is why the motion speaks to investing in education.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="757080"> On behalf of so many Canadian families and children, I ask that we invest in them and that we do it today. We must not think about doing it tomorrow, or a month after, or a year after.

              <ParaText id="757081">Mr. Speaker, the member spoke quite a bit about child care, so I will point my question in that direction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757082">As she well knows, child care is a provincial jurisdiction. That is why in the last budget we provided her home province and my home province an additional $90 million for child care, a significant increase for the provincial budget for child care. That is not all we have done. We have given every parent for children under age six the universal child care benefit of $100 per month for each child. I have stacks of letters from parents in my riding who appreciate that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757083">However, that is not all we did either. We have also brought in a $2,000 tax credit for every child under the age of 18. That is huge because for every parent, particularly for a single working mother with income under $40,000, it will reduce taxes by 25%. That is huge. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757084">We have supported families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757085">Unlike the member, my spouse is an early childhood educator. She works in day care. She can see the improvement. Yes, the program proposed by her government delivered some money to Peterborough, but it did not deliver any money to the adjacent riding of <Affiliation DbId="78646" Type="2">Haliburton—Kawartha Lakes—Brock</Affiliation>. Then again, that riding was held by a Conservative. My riding used to be held by a Liberal. To me, that is a pretty discriminatory program. Our program discriminates against no one and provides support to all parents.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="757088">The member talks about discrimination. Who is being discriminated against under the Conservative government at the moment? The children of Canada. They have been denied an opportunity because they do not have access to quality, universal, acceptable and affordable child care. Had the early learning agreements, as signed by the federal government and the provinces, not been cut up, every riding would have had almost 266 spaces. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757089">The Conservatives talk about giving $1,200 to parents. That $1,200 is taxable. The $100 per month is turned into almost $60 a month. Where in Canada can we find child care for almost $2 a day? That is a piecemeal approach. We need to have national leadership. We need to have vision on this issue so we have a national child care strategy in Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="757091">I am pleased to speak to today's motion because it allows me a chance to talk about what Canada's Conservative government is doing to support a more competitive and productive economy through investments in new technologies, research and development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757092">Countries that invest aggressively in innovation have the strongest and the most productive economies in the world. Countries that invest aggressively in innovation find solutions to environment, health and other pressing challenges. Simply put, countries that invest aggressively in innovation have high standards of living and a high quality of life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757093">Canada needs to take the steps now to ensure that we maintain a strong economy through scientific discovery and technological advances so we can seize the extraordinary potential of our great country to be a positive force in the world. This is why on May 17 the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> released our historic science and technology strategy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757094">Our approach to science and technology is underlined by four important principles. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757095">First, our policies and programs will inspire and assist Canadians to perform at world-class levels of scientific and technological excellence. World-class research excellence is Canada's standard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757096">Second, we will strategically target funding in areas of national strength and opportunity. Let me be clear. That does not mean abandoning our commitment to basic research across a broad spectrum of disciplines. We understand the importance of supporting the very best ideas wherever they arise. At the same time we must be practical. Canada is a comparatively small country and we must target more of our basic and applied research in areas where we are well positioned to make a difference in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757097">Third, the Government of Canada will foster partnerships. Partnerships involving business, academic and public sectors at home and abroad are essential to lever Canada's efforts into world-class successes and accelerate the pace of discovery and innovation. Through partnerships, the unique capabilities, interests and resources of various stakeholders can be brought together to deliver better outcomes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757098">After 13 years of Liberal corruption and waste, this Conservative government has turned over a new leaf of accountability. Therefore, accountability is the fourth principle of the S and T strategy. We have been clear. Those who are supported by public funds will be held accountable for demonstrating to taxpayers that results are being achieved. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757099">Guided by these principles, our science and technology strategy seeks to create three distinct Canadian advantages: first, an entrepreneurial advantage that encourages firms to be innovators; second, a knowledge advantage that keeps Canadians at the forefront of research and discovery; and third, is a people advantage that helps Canadians acquire the skills they need to participate in the knowledge based economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757100">Despite the Liberal's rhetoric, the Conservative government has invested more than $9 billion annually to support science and technology. On top of that, there are tax incentives available to Canadian businesses that invest in research and development valued at $3 billion a year. It was the leaderless Liberals who voted against more than $11 billion a year in R and D investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757101">The government's S and T strategy articulates a comprehensive vision of how the government can use the work of its departments, its expenditures and its policies to create a more productive and competitive economy. It sets out a multi-year agenda, and we are moving quickly to implement this agenda.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757102">Budget 2007 announced $1.9 billion in new S and T initiatives. These initiatives will empower scientists to investigate and entrepreneurs to innovate. To repeat, it was the leaderless Liberals who voted against this measure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757103">To create an entrepreneurial advantage, we need effective federal policies and laws that encourage companies to compete on the basis of innovation and invest in R and D and innovation. The most important role of the Government of Canada is to ensure a competitive marketplace and create an investment climate that encourages the private sector to compete against the world on the basis of its innovative products, services and technologies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757104">Our S and T strategy does this with ongoing reductions in corporate taxes, by establishing the lowest rate of tax on new business investment through smart regulation and by increasing the supply of foreign venture capital to support Canada's most innovative firms, measures the leaderless Liberals voted against.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="757106">Furthermore, this Conservative government appointed Red Wilson to lead a blue chip review of Canada's competition and investment policies to ensure that they are working effectively, allowing us to encourage even greater foreign investment and create more and better jobs for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757107">We are helping companies partner with universities and colleges to access the research networks, facilities and young research talent they need to succeed. Our new centres of excellence in commercialization and research program will help build critical mass in priority areas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757108">Our new business led networks of centres of excellence program will connect inspiring entrepreneurs and researchers. I know this will bring out the very best that Canadians have to offer the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757109">As I mentioned, our S and T strategy also seeks to sustain a knowledge advantage. Our budget 2007 commitments will sustain Canada's leadership position in the G-7 and public sector R and D performance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757110">On top of the $2.7 billion the Government of Canada already funds in university R and D, we are investing an additional $85 million a year in three federal granting councils to achieve world-class excellence in four priority research areas: natural resources and energy; environmental sciences and technologies; health and life sciences; and information and communications technologies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757111">We are also ensuring that Canadian researchers continue to have the best research equipment and facilities available through a $510 million additional investment in the Canada Foundation for Innovation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757112">We are investing an additional $100 million in Genome Canada and $500 million in Sustainable Development Technology Canada to keep Canadians at the forefront in these important areas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757113">The third advantage this S and T strategy encourages is a people advantage. Access to talented, skilled and creative people lies at the heart of our vision of building a sustainable national competitive advantage based on science and technology. We will make sure that Canada has the highly skilled people it needs to thrive in a modern global economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757114">We are creating new scholarships and industrial internships to support promising young Canadians who are studying hard to develop the skills that our businesses need. Once fully operational, we will be supporting 1,000 new scholarships and 1,000 new interns each and every year. At the same time, we will continue to reduce personal income taxes and make the tax system fairer, so that Canada can attract and retain the highly skilled workers we need to foster innovation and growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757115">Science and technology is at the heart of this Conservative government's economic plan. The Conservative government's S and T strategy is a multi-year innovation plan. I can assure all members that our work will improve our nation. We will continue to build a competitive advantage for Canada based on science and technology. We will continue to be guided by the principles of excellence, priorities, partnerships and accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757116">This Conservative government is getting the job done to ensure that Canada can seize its potential in the world and be an innovation leader.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757117">On behalf of the people of Oshawa, I am so pleased to be part of this S and T strategy. We are taking advantage of it now in our manufacturing sector and in our universities. I encourage all members to support us.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="757122">I would like to remind her that it was this Conservative government that conducted a manufacturing study across the entire country. We came up with 22 recommendations. Of those 22 recommendations, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> addressed 21 of them in our last budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757123">One of them in particular was so important, the two year writeoff of the capital cost allowance, that Canadian manufacturers and exporters actually said that the budget last year was the best manufacturing budget ever for Canada, ever. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757124">Here is the troubling part of this. This was a unanimous report. In other words, it was supported not just by the Conservative members, not just by the NDP, not just by the Bloc, but it was also supported by the Liberal Party of Canada. I want the member to stand up and state why she voted against that budget. Why did she vote against her own critic's recommendations for the manufacturing sector?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757125">As she says, I live in Oshawa. What this government has done is it has addressed the outstanding complaints of the auto industry after the 13 years of waste and mismanagement by the Liberal government. The Liberals did absolutely nothing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757126">What did we do? In the last budget we talked about $400 million for the Windsor-Detroit border crossing.

              <ParaText id="757133">Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I stand in the House today to talk about the importance of public infrastructure to help drive the Canadian economy. It is a very important issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757134">Last week in the Speech from the Throne, our government reaffirmed its deep commitment to infrastructure. We all know that infrastructure investment is vital to Canada's future prosperity. Infrastructure is in fact the motor of productivity. It promotes trade, stimulates economic growth, ensures strong communities, and something important to me and most Canadians, a healthy environment. Infrastructure helps directly our environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757135">That is why the Conservative government is moving forward to implement its building Canada plan. It is a plan that involves a historic effort that is without precedent in this great country on the part of the federal government. This plan will invest $33 billion to renew Canada's public infrastructure over the next seven years. This plan will deliver results that matter to Canadians. Some of those results include faster commutes, cleaner water, cleaner air, and safer roads and bridges. They are very important issues to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757136">This government understands how important it is to provide the provinces, territories and municipalities with the ability to plan for the future. Imagine in our own households not knowing what was coming in next month, next week or next year. That is why over 50% of the funding provided under building Canada, a total of more than $17 billion, is base funding for municipalities. This includes the extension of the gas tax fund until 2014 for which payments to municipalities will total $2 billion a year starting in 2010.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757137">The plan also includes funding of $25 million a year for each and every province and territory. This will provide a significant and reliable amount of funding to help the provinces and territories address infrastructure priorities and to know well in advance what money they have in order to pay for the groceries. This will include national priorities of this government, like clean water, the national highway system that stretches from coast to coast, transit and green energy. Over the course of seven years this amounts to more than $2.2 billion nationally. It is great news for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757138">We listen to Canadians. That is why our government has made the protection and promotion of a clean environment a key national objective. Investment in infrastructure can indeed be a powerful tool in attaining environmental objectives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757139">The plan will continue to contribute to the growth of public transit which is so important in our larger cities and which is one of the plan's top five priorities. In this we will continue on the path shown through our additional investments in transit in the greater Toronto area, in Vancouver and in Calgary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757140">Through the gas tax fund alone we will provide $11.8 billion over the next seven years to Canadian cities and communities. It is great news for our cities. This funding can also apply to environmentally sustainable infrastructure which includes transit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757141">In the Speech from the Throne we made a clear commitment through our building Canada plan to clean up contaminated sites and promote brownfield redevelopment. This will help improve Canada's infrastructure and will help Canadians health be better. I was shocked to learn when I came to the House that we have somewhere in the range of 20,000 contaminated sites in this country. It is an embarrassing record and something which the government is taking positive steps to remedy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757142">A major component of the building Canada plan is of course the $8.8 billion building Canada fund. The fund actually focuses on strategic infrastructure projects that will deliver economic, environmental and social benefits for all Canadians at the national and local levels. It is great news for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757143">A good example is that on October 15 we announced a commitment of up to $50 million to the clean water Huron Elgin London project. This initiative will improve clean drinking water access to half a million residents in some 20 southwestern Ontario municipalities. It is great news for the people of Ontario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757144">As well, we all know the importance of access to technology, particularly the broadband, to communities. This Conservative government has taken positive steps in that direction. We are clearly committed to helping communities have access to this important tool. Just a couple of weeks ago, together with the government of Nova Scotia, the federal government made a clear commitment to help provide 100% broadband coverage in Nova Scotia by 2009. It is great news for Nova Scotians. This complements other broadband investments we are making in the north. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="757145">Our plan provides for implementation of a public-private partnerships fund with a budget of $1.25 billion. Through this fund, we are taking a leadership role in developing P3 opportunities throughout the country. This will extend and increase the amount of money available for infrastructure projects, which is really going to help Canadians enjoy a better quality of life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757146">Last, our plan includes the gateways and border crossings fund with a budget of $2.1 billion, in addition to new and continued funding allocated in budget 2007 for the Asia Pacific gateway and corridor initiative. It now totals over $1 billion, which is great news for western Canadians, especially those in British Columbia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757147">In the past few months our government has signed two memoranda of understanding with six provincial governments. It is an example of a federal government that can get along with its provincial counterparts and actually get positive results for Canadians from coast to coast to coast. These agreements commit us to a study of strategic ports and commercial corridors in central and Atlantic Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757148">As we stated in our Speech from the Throne, the government will soon be announcing further details on how our building Canada plan's $33 billion will be invested. In the meantime, money is already flowing to communities through the gas tax fund and the 100% GST rebate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757149">Municipalities across the country are already using this fund to help meet their infrastructure needs. Whether it is the expansion of the TransLink fleet in Vancouver, British Columbia, or water projects across the river from here in Gatineau, Quebec, the Conservative government is delivering positive results for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757150">What we are doing with our building Canada plan goes well beyond the Government of Canada's financial contribution to infrastructure. What we are doing is helping build the Canada of the 21st century, a Canada that will be stronger, safer and better. This is great news for all Canadians and a reflection of what Canadians tell us they want.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757151">Along with other levels of government and the private sector, our building Canada plan will inject more than $50 billion--that is right, $50 billion--to ramp up all the infrastructure in this country. As all members in the House are aware, we have an infrastructure deficit of over $100 billion, as identified by the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. The Conservative government has listened to Canadians and is moving forward to fix that deficit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757152">The previous Liberal government left us with history's most challenging infrastructure gap. We are taking action as a government that listens to Canadians to speed up world class infrastructure for Canada and for all Canadians. We are delivering, for the first time in Canadian history, the long term, predictable funding that has been asked for by the municipalities. That is what provinces, cities and communities are looking forward to, want and are going to get, because this government delivers results.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="757160">As members of Parliament, every once in a while we come to the place where we sit down and take an inventory of what we have been able to accomplish, not only as individuals but as a party.

They are saying that finally we see ourselves making a difference with the tackling violent crime bill and many other bills that are coming forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757161">However, one of the other points, as it was even when I started out as a member of Parliament seven years ago, is the concern about the national debt. I am wondering if the parliamentary secretary could explain this. Our government had a $14 billion surplus and, unlike other governments, did not spend at the end of the fiscal year to get rid of the money. It was not out buying extra airplanes. It was dropping the surplus into the national debt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757162">Could the parliamentary secretary explain some of the advantages of doing that and explain the interest saved on the national debt? I know that for many a reduction in the national debt is one of the reasons we are here.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="757163">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question because, as all Canadians know, there is a Canadian dream to own one's house. Everybody wants to own their own home. Most people have to get a mortgage on that house. Until the house is paid off, people cannot really enjoy the fruits of their labour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757164"> In this case, the Liberal government before us bought a lot of houses and they were not efficient houses. As a result, we paid somewhere in the neighbourhood, I would suggest, of $500 million on the savings alone that our government has brought in, with the $24 billion or so that we have taken off the debt. That is a tremendous amount of interest. Now that we do not have to pay it, we get to put it toward other things, things that increase the quality of life of Canadians, such as infrastructure and tax savings, which we hear from Canadians that they really want.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757165">We are moving forward so that our children, our grandchildren and future generations of Canadians can enjoy the fruits of our labour. We are taking on the brunt of the Liberal negligence and inept management of the economy to make sure that after we are gone we will have left Canada a better place for our children and great-grandchildren.

              <ParaText id="757166">Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with my neighbour to the south, the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="78669" Type="2">York West</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757167">I want to say how pleased I am today to participate in this very important debate about two issues that I think speak to the future of the country and our ability to provide the standard of living and quality of life that Canadians rightly demand of our country and indeed of our governments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757168">I have had occasion over my career to sit on both sides of the House, and sitting here and listening to the various speeches on both sides reminds me of the story of two governments. I must say that I am quite envious of the Conservative government, because it inherited a wonderful opportunity to build even a better country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757169">Unfortunately, the story I need to tell is the one about what we were left with. We were left with a $42 billion deficit, high unemployment and high interest rates. Those were very difficult times. It would have been easy for us to throw up our arms in despair. Instead, we chose to roll up our sleeves and we brought about a phenomenal Canadian economic renaissance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757170">What did we do? I say this to remind Canadians of the excellent economic record of our government. We eliminated the deficit. We paid down the debt. We introduced the largest tax cut in Canadian history. We did not raise taxes, which is in juxtaposition to the present government. We did not raise taxes on low income Canadians; we lowered them. We lowered business and corporate taxes because it made sense, particularly in this particular debate on competitiveness and productivity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757171">We committed over $12 billion in new funding for research. It was interesting to note that an earlier speaker on the government's side said that Canada leads in research and development. That is true, but we on this side actually set that record. That is a fundamental difference between our record and theirs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757172">I guess the Conservatives have had the opportunities to show their stuff, as we say, early on in their government cycle. What did Canadians see? The version of the Conservative Party's view on increasing productivity is to actually make cuts in human resources development, literacy programs and post-secondary education. All those things are very important ingredients in developing a competitive strategy in a productivity enhancement plan for the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757173">However, early on, we saw that although the Conservatives raised the taxes on low income Canadians, they also participated in the income trust fiasco, the fiasco that really wiped out $25 billion in investments for thousands of small investors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757174">The other issue that I will raise now is the issue of interest deductibility, described by some people as the worst tax policy in 35 years, which essentially would have sent our businesses out into the international marketplace with one hand tied behind their backs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757175">Therefore, I wonder whether the Conservative government understands that it has to really change its view on how to increase the productivity and competitiveness of a country. That is not done by sending the wrong signals to the markets. That is not done by hindering the potential of our businesses, because at the end of the day, it is our businesses in the private sector that are generating these jobs.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="757176">We learned that early on. We did all we could as a government to empower the private sector to generate jobs and we were very successful. We were able to lower the unemployment rate from double digits to create over three million jobs. That is the sort of record that we had.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757177">When we look at other statistics, we invested billions in post-secondary education. On the corporate tax side to generate economic growth, to reward individuals and businesses, we lowered taxes. On the corporate tax side the Liberals reduced the tax rate from 28% to 21%. That spurred on economic activity. What was interesting was that the lower the taxes, the more revenue we generated for the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757178">The facts speak for themselves. The Conservatives have had a year and some odd months in power and they have already made serious mistakes. Canadians are wondering, actually they are beyond wondering, they are beginning to believe that in fact the Conservatives lack the competence in economic management to bring about the type of changes that we were able to build.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757179">We wonder whether the Conservatives have learned anything. The first thing we did was we established a very stable economy: low interest rates, low inflation, paid down the debt. We also did something else. It was not just about taxes and getting the macro-economic environment right. We also invested in people. We cannot be productive as a nation if we do not invest and put people first in our agenda. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757180">The great opportunity that we have had and which was clearly illustrated during our years in office was the way we dealt with the issue of labour as it relates to the marketplace and as it relates to immigration. The long term issue that we face in this country is indeed an aging society. Immigrants and aboriginal Canadians provide our greatest hope to address skill shortages. Almost 100% of all new labour opportunities as it relates to human resources will be through immigration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757181">On an issue related to immigration, what in fact did the Tories--I should not say the Tories--what did the Conservatives, the Reform Alliance do on the accreditation of foreign credentials? We have seen a cut in investments in that area. We wonder why that would happen. Do they prefer not maximizing the human resources potential of immigrants? Is that what that government is about? Why cut in that area? Why cut literacy programs? It is almost inconceivable that they would engage in the type of cuts that reduce opportunities for people in this country, particularly those whom we will depend upon to give us the type of skills that this country and the marketplace require.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757182">I cannot cover all the areas because of the time restrictions, but I can tell the House that I have not been at all impressed with the Conservative government. I have not been impressed with the way the Conservatives dealt with issues like interest deductibility. I am also not very impressed with the fact that they do not realize that at the end of the day we have to invest in research and development, we have to invest in people, we have to invest in post-secondary education because the wealth of our country, the wealth of our future will be generated by ideas that come from between our ears. To not recognize that is a major flaw.</ParaText>

In fact, I want to read it into the record so that those who are watching are fully aware of exactly what it is that we are discussing today. We are discussing the following motion:</ParaText>

                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757203">All of those are very important issues that we on this side of the House want to make sure we bring to the attention of the Canadian public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757204">My speech today is going to be twofold. First, I want to take the opportunity to remind the House and everyone watching at home, including my constituents in York West, of the outstanding progress that the Liberal government made on so many of those very files during the nearly 13 years that it was in office. Then, if I have any time left, I will attempt to summarize some of the many breaches of trust and broken promises to which the minority Conservative government has subjected Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757205">The Liberal government struck a fantastic new deal for cities, which I was very much a part of and on which I worked very hard. Our cities across Canada were very much in need of that. We pledged $5 billion over five years in gas tax revenues to help cities and communities, something they are currently enjoying because of the Liberal government. This would have risen to $2 billion annually thereafter. We will have to wait to see if that is still on the agenda.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757206">As part of the new deal, the Liberal government also committed to investing up to $800 million to improve public transit nationwide, something that we continue to hear about. We know how important it is when dealing with a variety of environmental issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757207">We signed 12 provincial and territorial gas tax agreements. More than 95% of Canadians living in municipalities would have benefited from $600 million in funding in 2006 alone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757208">The Liberals' budget 2004 included a full GST rebate for cities and communities, freeing up $7 billion for municipal investments across Canada over the next 10 years, something they very much needed. Our budget 2005 also committed to renewing the $4 billion Canada strategic infrastructure fund to continue to give municipalities the funding they needed to improve local infrastructure and for local investments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757209"> We know that the cities are the hearts of our communities and certainly need the ongoing support from all of us in the federal government. I have yet to hear any of that in the throne speech or in any of the intentions of the government today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757210">In fact, the Liberals designed infrastructure programs that delivered over $12 billion in funding from 1993 to 2005. The Conservatives have tried to reannounce our projects and all kinds of funding, but Canadians are not fooled. I asked the <Affiliation DbId="78771" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> last session how many buses and railcars we could buy with his empty promises. There is still no answer on that one and there are still no more buses or railcars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757211">We all know that research and development is critical to Canada's future. The Liberal government had committed more than $3 billion for research and regional development and pledged to invest $810 million over six years in ideas and enabling technology, which is Canada's future and its strength.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757212">The Liberals' investments for the three federal granting councils, federally funded research universities and hospitals and genomics research are helping to position Canada as a world leader in research and development. These investments continue to be critical for our country to continue to be a leader in R and D and to attract and retain the best and the brightest.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="757213">The Liberal government pledged $200 million in sustainable energy, science and technology, and more than $2 billion to help strengthen Canada's ability to prosper in a global knowledge-based economy, with an increased emphasis on new funding for university-based research.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757214">While we are speaking of universities, the Liberal government knew how important it was to invest in Canada's future through post-secondary education. Many of us have met with students who have their lobby week here on the Hill and they have stressed to us just how important it is for more investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757215">We Liberals know that we must invest in our students and ensure that they have the tools they need to succeed in life. In fact, in our 2006 election platform we had proposed to expand Canada access grants to cover all four years of study. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757216">We also had proposed to develop a fifty-fifty plan which would have paid for half of the tuition of all Canadian students for both first and last year of study, and to conduct a comprehensive review of student assistance in order to ensure that everyone has access to a university education to help build our great country. We also committed to provide additional funding for Canadian students studying abroad and to make a 50% increase in funding for graduate scholarships.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757217">These Liberal initiatives were very popular in my riding of York West where I am proud to say I have the great York University, home to many students who are really leading the way here in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757218">Just this week I had the opportunity to meet with students from York University through a meeting set up by the Canadian Federation of Students. They were clearly concerned about, “the lack of needed attention given to post-secondary education by the current government”. Two students from York University, Ben Keen and Fuad Abdi, also drew to my attention the need for a new grants program to replace the millennium scholarship foundation, which will expire in 2009.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757219">What is the Conservative government currently doing to help post-secondary students? I went through the throne speech and it was shocking to find that the words “students” and “post-secondary” do not even appear in the government's document. I guess that was just another oversight on its part.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757220">The Liberal government was acting to help students. Here are some additional examples. In 2004, my Liberal government established a new Canada learning bond to help lower income families save for post-secondary education.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757221">In November 2005, we also committed $550 million to extend Canada access grants to 55,000 students from low income families in all years of undergraduate studies. For graduate students, we had committed $210 million to increase the number of available Canada graduate scholarships.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757222">We had committed to investing $2.2 billion over five years for student financial assistance to address access, affordability, debt management, and service delivery. Members can tell where our priorities clearly were.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757223">To support the capacity of Canada's universities and colleges and to provide high quality post-secondary education, we earmarked $1 billion for post-secondary infrastructure, another high pressure item that we were hearing about from all universities across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757224">We were also investing more than $10 billion in programs to provide better opportunities for Canadians, including $4 billion more for post-secondary education. But the Conservatives have turned their backs on post-secondary education. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757225">Students are not the only people the Conservatives have turned their backs on. Many seniors have also suffered at the hands of this government and the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his trusty sidekick the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>. The Prime Minister promised that his government would not tax income trusts, and that is exactly what he did, thereby costing seniors and other people $25 billion in lost income.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757226">I am glad to have had an opportunity to get some points across on how important our productivity agenda is and how important it is to continue to build Canada and to invest in Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="757228">In 1993 the Liberals ran on a number of platforms. One was to reduce the cost of post-secondary education. That doubled. They talked about a commitment to health care. Wait times doubled and many Canadians do not have doctors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757229">The Liberals talked about eliminating the GST. Now they do not even support reducing that GST burden on Canadians. Let us talk about some other things they did. Liberal members ran an illegal kickback scheme. The Gomery commission talked about that. There was also the HRDC boondoggle. The Liberals cut funding to the RCMP and then presided over the year of the gun in Toronto. That is something to be proud of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757230">We have this motion in front of us today. That member is opposing the direction the government is going, but I must tell her that this government is getting results on things like infrastructure. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757231">She talked about students and post-secondary education. Let me just hone in on one thing because there was so much that she talked about. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757232">Her government cut post-secondary education support. Her government cut $26 billion to health care and post-secondary education. The member might want to refer to the 1995 budget. We have actually put in a 40% increase. The next time the member goes to York University, she should talk about the 40% increase to post-secondary education.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757233">I would really like to hear what she has to say about the 40% increase to post-secondary school funding that we proposed.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="757234">Mr. Speaker, let me set the record straight for the member. Evidently he does not know what the past history is all about. When the Liberals came into government in 1993, we found ourselves not with a $13 billion surplus as the government has now. What we found ourselves with was a $42 billion debt. That is what we had.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757235">We did not have the opportunity to go scattering money all over the place and trying to buy people's votes.

              <ParaText id="757247">I have looked at the Liberal motion and two points stand out. First, the motion calls on the government to significantly reduce corporate taxes in order to make the economy more competitive. Second, the motion calls for investments in physical infrastructure, new technologies and research and development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757248">I would like to point out that we are talking about industries and tax reductions. When we talk about industries, these tax reductions apply to all companies, even the oil companies. In my humble opinion and the opinion of some people in my riding, these companies are already making money hand over fist. They do not have the same sort of problems as other companies, and yet they are given tax breaks. I think it is absurd. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757249">This House is aware that in February 2007 the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology released a report containing 22 recommendations. As I said, it was released in February 2007, and the budget was tabled in March 2007. How did the government respond to those 22 recommendations?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757250">I would remind this House that work on the report began in May 2006. I sit on the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, and it has been working since then on the issue of industries because of the rising dollar, the increase in oil prices and all the problems facing industry. All the political parties have worked to find solutions to the problems affecting Canadian and Quebec companies and to save them from the impact of emerging countries such as China.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757251">As we know, many people work on a committee. Our committee has at least 15 members, apart from the translators. In all, about 20 people work on this committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757252">It took from May to February, nearly a year, to prepare a report containing 22 recommendations. When the budget was brought down in March, the month after these recommendations were made, not one complete recommendation, not even half a recommendation, was adopted. The only recommendation that was adopted in part was the first one, which called for depreciation over five years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757253">What did the Conservatives do as a good government? They accepted the first recommendation and spread it out over two years. They did not even cut it by half; they cut it by more than half. After working for one year, they took one recommendation and cut it by half. I wonder whether or not the work done in this House is productive? Is the government listening?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757254">Furthermore, this report was adopted by a majority. All political parties agree that these recommendations should be adopted and implemented. But no, none of these recommendations, with the exception of half of one, were retained.</ParaText>

They think they can just let things be and people will work things out. Not so, according to the coalition, which says that we will not get out of this alone and that the government should do something to help. Unfortunately, the government is doing nothing at all to help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757258">Like their counterparts the world over, Canadian manufacturers have to respond to market globalization. We must not forget that this is about globalization, and I will come back to that. They also have to deal with the emergence of a number of newly industrialized manufacturing powerhouses, such as China, India and Brazil, and with the shortage of skilled labour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757259">The committee was directed to analyze the entire manufacturing sector, and when it released its report, the Canadian dollar was worth 80¢. Now the dollar is worth $1.03. At the time, everyone thought that the price of gas, at 85¢ per litre, was exorbitant, but now it costs 96¢ per litre, and sometimes as much as $1 or $1.04 per litre.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757260">There is a growing gap between our industries and the emerging nations. Yet our government is doing nothing about it.

              <ParaText id="757261">This is a strong statement. Members of the Canadian Manufacturing Coalition include Serge Lavoie of the Canadian Plastics Industry Association, Bob Elliott of the Canadian Printing Industries Association, Ron Watkins of the Canadian Steel Producers Association, Mark Nantais of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers’ Association, and Pierre Boucher of the Cement Association of Canada. Over 20 presidents of various associations signed the letter, hoping that the government will not negate their year-long effort to develop these 22 recommendations by following up on just one of them, and then only halfway. I think that the presidents of these associations are smart enough to recognize the work accomplished by the committee. They want the government to implement their recommendations.</ParaText>

His short life of four years has had a profound impact and meaning for all first nations children and families in Canada. His name was Jordan. Jordan's principle is a child-first principle to ensure first nation children living on reserve have access to the same health services as other Canadian children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757351">The federal government has not implemented Jordan's principle and this means that first nation children with complex medical needs and disabled children living on reserve do not have access to health services that they require. It has been decades of jurisdictional wrangling. In my riding hundreds of children are in need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757352">Jordan was two years old when his family was informed that he could go home from the hospital and he would require health services on reserve.

              <ParaText id="757535">As the throne speech said, we are committed to investing resources to helping those seeking to break free from the cycles of homelessness and poverty, and we thank the Liberals for giving us the mandate to do exactly that.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="757555">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the Liberal Party's opposition motion, to which the Bloc Québécois objects for several reasons, as I will explain in this brief presentation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757556">I will begin with the reference to income trusts. This was a field day of irresponsibility. For years the Liberals refused to act on this issue and allowed income trusts to go tax free. They created an unfair advantage for this type of organization or enterprise. In addition, there was an increasing impetus for large corporations to adopt this economic model. It is a particularly pernicious model because it practically forces the company to spend all its money every year and to return surpluses to shareholders rather than investing them in research and development and spurring the growth of the company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757557">Thus, it is a very short-term vision that is destabilizing our economy. The Bloc Québécois had been asking for some time that these trusts be taxed as corporations, but the Liberal government did nothing. It acted irresponsibly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757558">The Conservatives were even more irresponsible during the 2005-2006 election campaign when they promised not to tax income trusts. That was an irresponsible promise, especially since many investors believed it and invested their money in this savings vehicle. When the Conservative government announced last year that income trusts would henceforth be taxed, trust stock prices plummeted, causing losses in the billions of dollars in market capitalization all because of this field day of irresponsibility: the irresponsibility of the Liberals, who never did anything about income trusts and are still today calling for this tax shelter to be maintained; and the irresponsibility of the Conservatives, who did in fact do something about it, but promised they would not, thereby giving investors false confidence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757559">Beyond this issue, this Liberal motion poses a major problem. I am talking about the same old centralist attitude of a domineering federalism that defines the Liberals, as well as the New Democrats and the Conservatives. We saw this today during question period on the issue of the securities commission.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757560">There is quite the unanimity within the federalist parties in this House. They are unanimous on the fact that there should always be interference in Quebec's jurisdictions. They also share the attitude of Ottawa knows best. This is where it is decided what is best for the nation of Quebec, which was unanimously recognized in this House. However, that recognition was nothing more than lip service. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757561">There is a lot of meddling in this motion. It talks about infrastructure, research and development, post-secondary education, assistance to immigrants, recognition of credentials, and labour force training, all in just two or three paragraphs; that is quite the feat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757562">This same old attitude harms Quebec because programs centralized in Ottawa are not adapted to Quebec realities. We see this quite often. Just look at the percentage of spending by the various departments in Quebec: we are almost systematically below our weight in terms of tax contributions and we are especially below our demographic weight. These programs are not adapted. Just look at Fisheries and Oceans. Quebeckers contribute 25%, but 25% of the budget certainly does not get spent in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757563">Taxation is another area where we see this. Ottawa puts in place centralized programs that do not reflect the reality in Quebec, and Quebeckers are punished and disadvantaged because they are part of the Canadian federation. I will give two examples. Taxation is not always exciting, but it represents hundreds of millions of dollars for Quebeckers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757564">The first example concerns tuition credits. We can claim tuition on our federal tax return and deduct up to $10,000 in tuition from our taxes.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="10">(1510)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="757565">In the rest of Canada, tuition averages $14,665 for a typical three-year university course worth 45 credits, but in Quebec it costs only $5,700. Students in Quebec therefore can claim only $5,700 of the $10,000 tax credit or 57%, while students in the rest of the country can claim the full amount.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757566">If we take a typical tax rate of 22%, which applies to people earning $50,000 or more—this is often true in the case of university students—that comes to $946 per student. If we multiply that by 111,000 students, we get roughly $105 million in savings for Canada, because Quebeckers decided to adopt a different system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757567">Some might say—and I have heard this said in this House—that it does not matter, all the better for Quebeckers. Since the students pay less tuition, it is only right that they should have fewer tax credits than other Canadians. This is wrong. What Quebeckers do not pay in tuition, they pay in tax. Quebeckers decided to collectively pay students' tuition rather than expect students to pay a larger share themselves. Consequently, we are penalized because of the choices we have made. What is more, every year, Canada reaps huge savings. This is a gift from Quebeckers to Canada, and the federal government is still refusing to wake up to that reality and give us back our money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757568">Another similar example is the credit for child care. In Quebec, we decided to establish community tools such as very low-cost child care, at $7 a day, instead of the much higher average of $35 and up in the other provinces. This means that again the government saves hundreds of millions of dollars every year because Quebeckers decided to do things differently. When we ask the federal government to give the money back to provincial governments, it systematically refuses. We are not asking for a handout; we are asking that the savings be returned to Quebeckers, who chose to use a different model.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757569">Unfortunately, I am running out of time, but I could go on about all these examples. Obviously, Quebeckers are realizing more and more that the federal framework does not allow them to build a nation, a society in their own image, and that in the medium term, the solution is for Quebec to become a sovereign country that fully controls all its taxes and can make its own budgetary decisions based on the type of society it wants to build.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757570">Until then, the Bloc Québécois will at the every least continue to demand that the Constitution be respected, and to call for the decentralization of the federation and a solution to the fiscal imbalance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757571">The latest budget contained a monetary correction for the fiscal imbalance. The government gave several billion dollars that will help the Government of Quebec. However, in order to correct the fiscal imbalance, we are asking for a fiscal solution. Otherwise, the fiscal imbalance issue will not be resolved. The minister himself appeared before the committee and told us that there was no fiscal solution in the latest budget. Once tax or GST points have been transferred, Quebeckers will be able to decide how that money is to be managed, without having always to ask Ottawa for permission, and without having to beg for their own money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757572">It is important to establish another measure to avoid the centralization of the federation, which we are seeing at this time and which the three parties have been constantly supporting for several decades in Canada, specifically, to really limit use of the federal spending power in areas of Quebec jurisdiction. A rather inane sentence about this appears in the Speech from the Throne.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757573">I would like to issue a challenge to the Conservative members, who could perhaps use the questions and comments period at the end of my speech to give me a list of the projects that, over the past 10 or 15 years, have met the criteria set out in the throne speech.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="15">(1515)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="757574">According to these criteria, they have to be new cost-shared programs that fall under Quebec's jurisdiction. Given all of these criteria, there are simply no programs left. There have been almost no new cost-shared programs that fall exclusively under Quebec's jurisdiction in decades. The last ones were about health insurance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757575">This is a real con. The federal government is giving us a totally meaningless gift.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757576">Earlier, I asked the Conservative members of the House what programs they were talking about. I asked them to name one single program that the federal government has implemented in the past five to 10 years that meets the criteria mentioned in the Speech from the Throne, that is, a new shared-cost program that falls exclusively under provincial jurisdiction. I myself have not yet found a single one. I challenge the Conservative members to provide us with a list to prove that what they are giving us is worth something. If they cannot, then they are promising something we already have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757577">It looks as if the Conservative government is simply encroaching on provincial jurisdiction without even sharing the costs with the provinces. Even if the Conservatives came up with a bill to deliver on their throne speech promise, we would get nothing new. There is no substance to what the Conservative government is offering. I hope that the Conservative members will be able to give me a list.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="757580">Mr. Speaker, judging by his question, the hon. member clearly does not understand the concept of the fiscal imbalance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757581">The fiscal imbalance occurs when the federal government has too much revenue in relation to its constitutional responsibilities, while the provinces do not have enough revenue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757582">Nonetheless, I will answer his question. It is quite simple. When will the fiscal imbalance be corrected? It will be corrected when the federal government stops spending in the jurisdictions of Quebec and the provinces. That is clear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757583">If the federal government has the means to spend money in the jurisdictions of Quebec and the provinces, then it has too much revenue in relation to is constitutional jurisdictions. This is no laughing matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757584">When enough money has been transferred from the federal government to the governments of Quebec and the provinces, and the government is no longer spending money in Quebec's jurisdictions, the fiscal imbalance will have been corrected. Clearly this is not the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757585">In its motion, the Liberal Party is proposing again today that money, taxes, be spent in provincial jurisdictions. Conclusion: the federal government has too much money in relation to its responsibilities and has to spend it in provincial jurisdictions. That is the imbalance that needs to be corrected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757586">It is quite simple. There is no need to conduct polls, hold consultations or ask anyone whether the fiscal imbalance has been corrected. Once this House is dealing only with issues of a federal nature and it stops interfering in provincial jurisdictions, then we will know.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="757592">Mr. Speaker, the provinces have needs in terms of infrastructure and, clearly, they do not have enough money, while the federal government has too much. The solution is to correct the fiscal imbalance and to transfer predictable revenues to the provincial governments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757593">I would also like to point out to the House that I issued a challenge to Conservative members to give me a list of programs, of the historical gains they claim to have given Quebec in their throne speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757594">No one bothered to rise to try to show from which programs, over the past five or 10 years, the Government of Quebec could have opted out, if the promise to limit use of the federal spending power—which is in the throne speech—had been implemented. No one bothered to rise. I think their silence speaks volumes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757595">That promise is a sham. It is an empty promise. We are being promised something that we do not need, something that is already inapplicable. The three federalist parties continue to want to centralize the federation and tell Quebeckers what is good for them, while what Quebeckers really want is greater independence to build a society according to their own vision.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="78627" Type="2">Hon. Bryon Wilfert (Richmond Hill, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="757596">Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="78505" Type="2">Charlottetown</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757597">I am delighted to speak to this motion. First of all, we have a good fiscal situation in Canada because of the record of the Liberal government for 13 years. I would point out that in 1993 when the Liberals came into power, we inherited a $42.5 billion deficit. During that time, we had to deal with fundamental issues to put our fiscal house in order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757598">There is no question that the current government inherited a significant amount of money because the Liberals were prudent. We dealt with the deficit and at the same time, we invested and we started to pay down the national debt as well. I think during our time in government over $60 billion was paid on the national debt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757599"> I want to talk about municipal infrastructure. It should come as no surprise that the current government has failed miserably the cities of Canada. I point that out because in 1983 the Federation of Canadian Municipalities proposed a national infrastructure program to the government. At that time there was about a $17.5 billion municipal deficit. The government of the day said that if it were re-elected it would put that into operation, but that government was not re-elected. The Conservatives came in and for 10 years the national infrastructure program lay dormant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757600">In 1993 when the Liberals returned to power, they created the national infrastructure program, with participation from all three orders of government: a third, a third and a third. This was renewed in 1997. As a former president of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities I know all too well how important this was for cities in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757601">During the time of the Liberal government from 1993 to 2006, a number of major infrastructure programs were developed. In fact that money went toward improving highways, transit, sewers, basic infrastructure, recreation. It was extremely important. Our cities are the economic engines of Canada. We need to invest in them. We need to realize that although constitutionally the cities are under the jurisdiction of the provinces, the fact is that people who live in the cities, and now 80% of the population lives in our major cities in Canada, we need to invest in them. We need long term sustainability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757602">Regrettably the current government has failed. Now we have a $100 billion deficit. We are dealing with everything from rusting bridges, and we have seen what has happened in the city of Montreal as an example, to poor water treatment systems, to problems with transit. There has not been the investment. The government will probably talk about the building Canada fund of $30 billion of which $4 billion only is earmarked for cities. With a $100 billion deficit, $4 billion is not going to cut it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757603">We need real partnerships. We really need to invest. When the Liberals were in power we eliminated the GST on goods and services. I remember fighting that battle. We only got 57% of the rebate and eventually it was the Liberal government that came in and eliminated 100%. What did that mean for Richmond Hill alone? It meant a million dollars in savings in one year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757604">Understanding cities is important. We need to understand that they are the economic engines. People who live in these cities have to get to work. They have to be able to get from point <I>a</I> to point <I>b</I> and they cannot do that if the infrastructure is falling apart. We all have a responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757605">When the <Affiliation DbId="105459" Type="96">leader of the Liberal Party</Affiliation> went to Calgary in June, he reaffirmed the commitment of this party to long term infrastructure sustainability. This is a party that returned part of the gas tax to cities and communities across the country. This is the party that understood from the beginning the need to invest in infrastructure. When we invest in that, we have better productivity and that is extremely important for the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757606">When we talk about lowering taxes I am clearly on record as supporting the lowering of taxes, both corporate and personal taxes, but we also have to have the investment in communities, whether they are large or small.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="30">(1530)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="757607">We have situations in Canada where we are not competitive because we do not have that investment in infrastructure. We need to have that. If the government is bringing in a fiscal update, it needs to look at that kind of investment in cities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757608">We hear the big city mayors across Canada continually say that the government is not listening. It is not paying attention to an issue which clearly is of the utmost importance for Canadians. Any fiscal update or budget that may come forward needs to address that fundamental issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757609">We cannot have sewers that are falling apart. We cannot have a situation where roads are falling apart. People want to see three orders of government working collaboratively. That does not preclude the private sector. We certainly have seen private sector investment in past infrastructure programs. That is very useful, but again, the municipal governments have to be at the table. They have to be part of the solution. They have to be able to, as they did under the Liberal infrastructure programs, propose what their capital issues are. They have capital programs, five and ten year programs, where they can say they need to advance these things that are very important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757610">I know my friend from the Northwest Territories who is in the House, a former mayor of Fort Smith and a former president of the Northwest Territories Association of Communities, whom I had the pleasure to work with for a number of years, understands this problem from a northern perspective. There is no question whether one is in the north or whether one is in the southern part of this country, infrastructure needs to be addressed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757611">We of course had the new deal. These are the kind of innovative programs that I will want the government to consider, to start to really listen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757612">I realize that the big cities have not necessarily been electorally successful for that party, but that should not be the consideration. The consideration should be that these are the areas of Canada that produce such wealth. If we want to be truly competitive, if we want to match what is being done in Germany, in the United States, in Japan and elsewhere, we need to invest in cities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757613">I would urge the government to take a leaf out of the Liberals' book of what the Liberals have done in the past successfully. We have received accolades galore from city mayors across the country because they understand. We developed a 20 year strategy to address infrastructure and other needs in this country. For me that is a vision. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757614">We need a national vision when dealing with infrastructure. We cannot do it piecemeal. We cannot simply say that it is somebody else's responsibility. We need to have it earmarked. We have to be able to say to the provinces and the cities that we are all part of this issue. It is not simply about writing cheques; it is about making sure that the money is delivered for the programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757615">The same would be true for recreational facilities and things like bicycle paths, if we really believe in making sure that people are healthier. The federal government has a role to play as well in reducing carbon monoxide and improving the health of people in our cities and communities across the country and investing in transit. Again, it should be a dedicated transfer. Funding is important in those areas of the country where that is warranted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757616">This is part of the Liberal vision, what we have enunciated and have implemented for many years. We believe very strongly that this is something the Government of Canada needs to do because without doing so, from a competitive standpoint we will fall behind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757617">That is also true in investing in research facilities in our cities. We must make sure that we are investing in post-secondary education. With respect to post-secondary education, we need to convene a federal-provincial conference to talk about the plight of students who are faced with horrendous debt as they come out of colleges and universities. The Canadian Federation of Students and other stakeholders who understand the problem need to be at the table so that we can design a dedicated transfer to the provinces in that regard, as we did on health care funding when we were the government. It is extremely important that we do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757618">My plea is very simple. If we do not invest today, we will suffer tomorrow in terms of being competitive in the international community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757619"> I would trust that the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, when he brings down his mini-budget or his statement, will address that. We are all for debt reduction and all for tax cuts, no problem, except we need a balance, and if we are not going to bring that in, we will suffer in the long term.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="757620">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to rise and ask questions of my hon. colleague from Richmond Hill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757621">I am certainly interested in what he has to say about infrastructure. We all know that infrastructure guides the progress of our industry and our lives. Certainly we need money to invest in infrastructure. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757622">The motion today in talking about the reduction of corporate taxes follows a trend that was set over 13 years that brought Canada's corporate tax rate down to the other corporate tax rates in North America and around the world. In reality the corporate world in Canada has not been hurt. When the NDP forced the Liberals in 2004 not to reduce the corporate tax rate further, that did not upset industry. That did not upset business in this country. Things kept on going.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757623">When we look at infrastructure and we look at the dollars we need to invest in our cities, towns and villages and we think of those that are going to gain from that investment, why would we want to cut back corporate taxes, cut back the available resources that the federal government can put into the important infrastructure work?

              <ParaText id="757625">Mr. Speaker, I would point out to my hon. colleague that the Liberal government reduced corporate taxes dramatically, from 26% down to 19% and the Conservatives are proposing a dramatic cut from 19% to 18.5%. I would point out that reducing corporate taxes gives us a competitive advantage in the world, which is extremely important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757626"> I understand where the member is coming from, but I would point out to him that we need to be on that cutting edge. That gives us an extra cutting edge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757627">At the same time, I suggest that a reduction of the GST by 1%, which would cost the national treasury between $5 billion and $6 billion, could be better used elsewhere. The government across the aisle eliminated the $3 billion contingency fund that we had set up to deal with unexpected situations, such as the ones we have had in the past, such as SARS, BSE, et cetera.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757628">The fact is the GST cut could better be used in terms of infrastructure investment. That would be very important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757629">I do believe a reduction in corporate taxes would encourage investment. It would encourage reinvestment in cities and communities. Obviously, it would make us extremely competitive internationally.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="757630">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise on this issue and speak to this motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757631">Let me say at the outset that I will be supporting the motion. The gist of the motion is that the government take measures to drive greater productivity in this country. It is, in my opinion, a term that is not used as much as it should be in this town. It is extremely important. The whole issue of productivity determines our future prosperity as a nation. Everything we do here in the Government of Canada should, in my opinion, be viewed through a productivity lens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757632">Canada has not done as well as it should. Our productivity level is approximately 85% of that of the United States. The gap is getting greater. We are basically a resource based economy. Prices are reasonably strong, but on the other side of the equation, the manufacturing sector is not doing that great. I believe the statistics are that approximately 80,000 jobs have been lost lately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757633">It is up to the Government of Canada to take action on productivity, and I do hope this motion is supported and acted upon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757634">Regarding the first two budgets of the government and the most recent Speech from the Throne, although there have been some positive comments, I believe direction is lacking. One of the positive comments that came out of the last speech was how the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> was talking about a single securities regulator. I know there are jurisdictional issues on that, but again, this is something I urge him to continue to work on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757635">Interprovincial trade barriers have plagued this country's economy for many, many years now. Again, I realize there are jurisdictional issues, but I believe this is something that we and all Canadians should work on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757636">When we look at productivity, we look for certain programs, initiatives and policies. Some of the more commonly accepted ones are increased research and development, especially in the private sector, and increased technology transfer. On those issues, I am very pleased with the Liberal record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757637"> Starting about eight or nine years ago, billions and billions of dollars have been put into the foundations for peer reviewed research. A lot of it is done in the academic institutions, but a lot of it is done in the private sector also. This is a program and a policy that has worked.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757638">We look to policies and programs to improve our infrastructure, which the previous speaker spoke about. We look for improved highways, ports, airports and broadband so that our goods, our people and our knowledge can be transferred quickly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757639">We look for open, fair and equitable trade agreements. I am not sure I like the discussion regarding the South Korean trade agreement, but again that is something that will be debated further in this House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757640"> We look for labour mobility, especially labour mobility within the provinces of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757641"> We look for progressive immigration policies, especially in regard to immigrants with the skills this country needs. We look for policies so that when those immigrants do come to our shores their skills are recognized. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757642">We look for skills training and lifelong learning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757643">Two of the most fundamental issues that we look for are education, starting with our early childhood education system and going on to our secondary education system and our post-secondary education system, and, very importantly, an effective and efficient tax system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757644">It is somewhat ironic, and it has been said before in this House today in regard to this motion, that economists are unanimous regarding the GST. It is totally unbelievable that one of Canada's national newspapers surveyed 20 economists from different organizations and they were all unanimous that the reduction of the GST, from a productivity point of view, was not the way to go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757645"> All 20 surveyed were of that view and I am not aware of any economist in this country who shares a contrary view. If there is one out there, I would ask that he identify himself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757646">Some of the economists are Sherry Cooper, chief economist at BMO Nesbitt Burns; David Park, chief economist, Vancouver Board of Trade; Jim Stanford, economist, Canadian Auto Workers; Ian Munro, economist, Atlantic Institute for Market Studies; and Don Drummond, chief economist with the Toronto-Dominion Bank, who says that not only should the GST not be reduced, but it actually should be increased. I do not think we will ever find another issue on which there is unanimity among so many economists. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="40">(1540)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="757647">What we are looking for are taxes that are efficient and effective. First we look for the reduction of capital taxes. They are a very inefficient, unproductive method of taxation. We also look for reductions in the rate of corporate taxation. The Liberal Party reduced it from 28% to 19% and the Conservative government has taken it down another half a point, from 19 points to 18.5.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757648"> We look for decreases in taxes on personal income, especially for Canadians in the lower income brackets, and it is my opinion that the reduction in consumption taxes is not the way to go at this time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757649">Why is it that we are going in this direction? It is my suggestion that it is just politics. It appeals to some people, but it is not the way to go. It is not a pan-Canadian approach. It is not a long term view of the economy of this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757650">I cannot cover every topic, but there are a few I want to talk about. Another one I want to mention is the whole area of education. It is my view and opinion that this is an issue that is very critical to this country's productivity.</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757655">I believe that view is held unanimously, but I am disappointed with some of the directions that this country is taking. In the last Speech from the Throne, it was promised that the Government of Canada would create 125,000 early childhood development spaces. It was not repeated in the latest Speech from the Throne. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757656">Now, after 20 months, we ask the question: how many did the government create? Did it create 100? Did it create 75,000? Did it create 50,000? Did it create 25,000? Does anyone in the House know the answer to that question? The answer is none, zero, a big goose egg.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757657">We see the same direction on the whole issue of post-secondary education. It is my belief and position that more resources have to be directed toward students, especially students from lower and middle income families, and there have to be more government grants based on need. I believe it is time for this country to take a couple of steps back and look at the total picture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757658">It is time that the government looked at the educational tax credit and also at the book tax credit, which I do not think helps anyone except perhaps the very rich. We should take a look at the whole picture and ask ourselves what the best program is for students right across Canada, because it is my belief that we are abandoning the democratic right to an education, and I believe we have to move very quickly on that issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757659">I see that I am quickly running out of time and there are other issues I want to talk about. I support increased resources to students on needs based issues with certain principles of accountability built into them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757660"> Another one is the whole issue of infrastructure. The previous speaker spoke to that eloquently. I believe we are lacking on this, but more importantly, the accountabilities are not there. They are not built into the system. I know I do not have time to review that now.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="757661">In closing, I will be supporting the motion. I think the government's productivity lens has to be adjusted. The question has to be asked in every program, in every piece of legislation and in every policy: does this initiative makes the country more productive? Also, we have to do it in a way that is accountable.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="757662">Mr. Speaker, it is a little difficult on this side of the House to listen to those former government members, who governed for 13 years and who after their first year in government cut $25 billion out of health and post-secondary education, while today they stand in front of the public saying that is where all the investment should go to enhance our opportunities. It is so hypocritical of the party opposite. When those members were in government and had the opportunity to do that, they chose to cut the funding to those very services that today they say are so important. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757663">It is also important to recognize the fact that economists are one group of people, but consumers are another group.

This is the only form of tax break they get from any government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757664">My question for the member, and for anyone else who might want to answer it, is very simple. Is it Liberal Party policy to increase the GST should it ever become the Government of Canada again?</ParaText>

I cannot really tell the difference between the parties when it comes to tax policy. Yes, Liberals and Conservatives can argue over GST cuts. They can argue over the details, but they are dedicated to cutting corporate taxes. They have done it for many years. Right now we are running at close to $10.5 billion in corporate tax cuts that are going to accrue this year over 2001. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757673">The return investment by those corporations into our economy has risen by only 1% of the gross national product. Where are we seeing the great return to the Canadian economy from this type of corporate tax cut?</ParaText>

However, before I continue I will briefly comment on the state of our economy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="757678">While there are always opportunities to do more, our economy is strong and we are focused. To illustrate this point, let me reference a few facts and figures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757679"> We are experiencing the second longest period of economic growth in the history of Canada. Core inflation has remained within our set range of 1% to 3%. Our unemployment rate is the lowest in more than 30 years and there are more Canadians participating in the workforce than ever before in the history of Canada. We are reducing debt at a record rate. We are on the best financial footing of any country in the G-7 and we are the only country of the G-7 not having a yearly increase in the national debt. </ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757682">Nevertheless, we must remain prepared for the challenges that confronts us. These challenges include: the significant rise in the Canadian dollar and its impact on the manufacturing sector; increased competition from emerging economic giants like China and India; and a shortage of skilled workers and an aging population. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757683">We have a long term economic plan for Canada. It is a plan that will lead to a more rewarding future for Canadians and their families, including those families in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="78817" Type="2">St. Catharines</Affiliation>. It is a plan to give Canada and Canadians the key advantages to compete effectively and attract new growth and further investment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757684">That plan is entitled “Advantage Canada”. Advantage Canada focuses on creating five key advantages: first, a tax advantage, reducing taxes for all Canadians and establishing the lowest tax rate on new business investment in the G-7; second, a fiscal advantage, eliminating Canada's total government net debt in less than a generation; third, an infrastructure advantage, building modern world-class infrastructure that promotes economic growth, a clean environment and international competitiveness; fourth, a knowledge advantage, creating the best educated, most skilled and most flexible workforce in the world; and fifth, an entrepreneurial advantage, reducing unnecessary regulation and red tape and increasing competition in the Canadian marketplace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757685">This plan has been praised repeatedly. For instance, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce said the plan was, “a great road map. It's got all the elements of things we need to do.” and that it recognized the importance of productivity to the long term health of our economy, business growth and Canadians' standard of living.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757686">I can go further. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business also commended the plan noting that its “ focus is certainly the key issues that our members say should be focused on, whether it's debt, taxes, a skilled workforce or the whole red-tape and paper burden”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757687">How are we achieving the first of these advantages, the tax advantage? The government is building a business tax environment that is internationally competitive and neutral with respect to business and investment decisions. This is crucial for the right conditions for business to grow and to prosper. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757688">Our government committed in our economic plan to make Canada's overall tax rate on new business investment the lowest, yes, the lowest in the G-7. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="757689">Since 2006, the government has taken a number of actions to enhance business tax competitiveness. We eliminated one of the most inefficient taxes, the federal capital tax, in January 2006. We eliminated the corporate surtax for all corporations, large and small, in 2008, thereby reducing their tax rates by 1.12%. We will reduce the corporate statutory income tax rate to 18.5%, by 2011, from 21% in 2007.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757690">When a company builds a new building or an addition, it can write off the cost of that building within the useful life of that facility. We have aligned capital cost allowance rates with useful life. When companies invest in equipment within the building, they now can write down that investment within two years, instead of eight, ten or fifteen years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757691">It is not only the federal government that can provide tax relief to Canadian businesses. Provinces also have an important role in improving Canada's business tax competitiveness. To encourage further provincial action, budget 2007 put in place a financial incentive to work toward the elimination of provincial capital tax. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757692">Canadians are already reaping the rewards of the first of these measures. Since the announcement of the measure to encourage provinces to eliminate their capital taxes as soon as possible, Quebec and Ontario have both acted to qualify for that incentive, and Manitoba has also announced its intention to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757693">Canada now has a solid statutory corporate rate advantage over the United States, and this advantage will just continue to grow through 2011. We are well on track to having the lowest overall tax rate on new business investment in the G-7.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757694">The motion also highlights the importance of research and development. The government recognizes that private sector research and development is crucial for the long term growth and prosperity of our economy. The scientific research and experimental development tax incentive is a program that is one of the most advantageous in the industrial world. In fact, this incentive provided over $3 billion in tax assistance to Canadian businesses in 2006.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757695">The scientific research and development tax incentive program plays, and will continue to play, a leading role in fostering a competitive and dynamic business environment in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757696">Other countries are not standing still and neither will we. We want to maximize the efficiency of our research and development incentives for Canadian innovators.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757697"> On October 5, the government launched public consultation on the scientific research and experimental development tax incentive program. These consultations, which are taking place as we speak and will continue through the month of November, up until November 30, will advance the government's long term economic plan to establish an entrepreneurial advantage. We want to create a business environment that unleashes private investment and a knowledge advantage by creating the best educated, most skilled and most flexible workforce in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757698">The consultations also provide the foundation for the government to fulfill its commitment in budget 2007, its science and technology strategy, mobilizing science and technology to Canada's advantage to identify opportunities for improving the scientific research and development tax incentive program to further encourage research and development within the business sector here in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757699">With Advantage Canada, our government has laid out a sensible economic plan to secure better paying jobs, solid growth and a bright future for Canadians. We have already taken action to implement this plan, but we will do more. As part of ensuring economic security for Canadians, our government will bring forward a long term plan of broad based tax relief for individuals, for businesses and for families. We will continue to make Canada more productive and more competitive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757700">To that end, tomorrow in the riding of <Affiliation DbId="78817" Type="2">St. Catharines</Affiliation> a manufacturing company will be making a significant announcement as to its ability to do business in the Niagara region. One of the reasons is based on the fact that it will be able to take advantage and implement part of the manufacturing and business tax incentives included in the 2007 budget. Inside work, the equipment it needs to purchase to have that business function, will be written down over a period of two years, instead of ten or fifteen years. This speaks loudly, not only in St. Catharines and in Niagara but across our country, that our plan is working.</ParaText>

It is very easy to determine in my opinion the difference between the party in opposition today and the Conservative party in government. It is simply this. When we make our commitments and we lay out very clearly what our commitments are from year to year, in the 2006 budget and our commitments in the 2007, we pay heed to the economy. We pay heed to ensuring that those in our country who deserve a hand up, not a hand out, get that. Every person has benefited from the 2006 budget.

              <ParaText id="757716">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in the House on behalf of the constituents of Crowfoot and to speak against the opposition motion that has been brought forward to the House today. This motion is sponsored by the Liberal finance critic who consistently fails to recognize the strength of the Canadian economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757717">Our economy is rock solid. In fact, Canada is the only G-7 country with budget surpluses and a falling debt burden. Employment is up, unemployment is at a record low. Taxes are lower for families, individual Canadians, as well as for businesses. In short, the future looks bright.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757718">No doubt some of the hon. members across the floor may be asking themselves how this Conservative government has accomplished so much in such a short time. I will tell the House how we have done it. We have done it because, through the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the finance minister, the government has brought forward a plan and it has stuck to the plan. I am talking, of course, about Advantage Canada, this government's long term economic plan for Canada's future, a plan that is built on the foundation of solid fiscal management with the aim of achieving key advantages for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757719">What do these advantages entail? They include a tax advantage toward which we have already realized significant results; over $41 billion worth of tax cuts over three years for individual Canadians and businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757720">Over the summer, throughout my constituency of Crowfoot many people would stop by my vehicle when I was on the main streets of different communities to share their views and opinions about the performance and the direction that this Conservative government was going. They encouraged me to take the message back to Ottawa and to our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> that they wanted us to continue to reduce taxes because, in their opinion and in my opinion, we still pay too much in taxes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757721">I assured my constituents that we would continue to reduce taxes for all Canadians. We are about to establish the lowest tax rate on new business investments of the entire G-7 nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757722">Advantage Canada also has a fiscal advantage. It makes debt reduction a priority. I had the opportunity of speaking on that earlier today. This is a priority for a lot of members of Parliament on this side of the House who came here believing that the close to $600 billion debt was far too high. We will continue to reduce Canada's debt load because it is a debt that will be a burden to our children and grandchildren. In fact, our plan is to eliminate Canada's total government net debt in less than a generation, and we are well on our way to accomplishing that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757723">As the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> pointed out, we have reduced the federal debt load by more than $27 billion over the last two years. That amounts to $1,100 for every man, woman and child that the national debt was reduced over the term that this government has been in power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757724">Let us not forget our tax back guarantee, a guarantee that provides a direct benefit to Canadians by dedicating all interest savings from the federal debt to further reduce personal income taxes. To date, we have provided Canadians with over $1.5 billion in personal income tax relief as a result of paying down the debt and as a result of the tax back guarantee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757725">The third component of Advantage Canada and one that has not had a lot of recognition here today is the commitment to create an entrepreneurial advantage. To that end, the government is reducing red tape for businesses to help create an environment for Canadian businesses to prosper. There is still work to do but our commitment is firm.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757726">For example, the government is committed to its goal to reduce the paper burden on business by 20% by November 2008.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="757727">Our government has also set its sights on building a knowledge based advantage. This includes implementing a labour market training system that ensures Canadians get the training and the skills they need to get a good job, a job with a future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757728">In short, we want to help the country create an education system that brings forward the most skilled and most flexible workforce. If we are to be productive and competitive in a world with a global economy, we need to recognize that our labourers need to be top skilled labourers, and they are that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757729">Finally, the Advantage Canada plan will create an infrastructure advantage. We have spoken about infrastructure a fair bit today, a modern, world-class infrastructure Canadians can be proud of. In order to complete on a global scale, we need to build the modern bridges, the roads and the gateways necessary to get our goods to the market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757730">Contrary to what some in the other parties realize, our markets are not just domestic markets. Our markets are around the world, whether it be agriculture or whatever, and we must be certain that the products get to market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757731">Where do we go from here?The Speech from the Throne laid out a very clear direction in which we would go, a plan that we have committed to. We have said that we are committed to working with other Canadians to build a nation that is a model for the rest of the world. To meet this commitment, the Government of Canada's vision for Canada has five core priorities: first, strengthening Canada's sovereignty and place in the world; second, strengthening the federation and our democratic institutions right here at home; third, providing effective economic leadership for a prosperous future; fourth, and one on which I receive calls in my riding every day, tackling crime and strengthening the security of Canadians; and, fifth, ensuring that our environment is looked after, improving the environment for the health of all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757732">The throne speech that was delivered only a little over a week ago highlights our commitments to support a wide range of economic activity across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757733">Today, when I read the motion put forward by the opposition across the way, there was not one mention of agriculture. We hear very little from the opposition, from the Liberal Party or from the NDP, about agriculture. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757734">The throne speech recognizes the importance of the agricultural sector in Canada. We have listened to the ideas and concerns of farmers. We have listened to the stakeholders and we have listened to the consumers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757735"> At their meeting in June, the ministers of agriculture endorsed growing forward, a policy statement incorporating a bold, market driven vision for Canada's agriculture, agri-food and agri-based products industry. It will guide the development of federal-provincial-territorial programming in the industry. This program is a collaborative, forward focused vision for a profitable and competitive agriculture sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757736">Much can be accomplished in agriculture and Canada's agriculture industry will benefit from this government's promotion of, for example, the biofuel initiative that we have put forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757737">We have seen and we see now commodity prices at close to, not an all-time high but a remarkable level of dollars for the product that we are producing. Canola is at over $9 a bushel. Wheat is starting to creep its way up. Barley is at $2.50 a bushel, which does give concern to the feed industry, but there is an optimism out there that I have not seen for years, an optimism that producers can continue to have because we have a government that is listening to the concerns of the agricultural community. We realize that we must have strong, solid trade around the world which is why we have ongoing trade negotiations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757738">This not just talk. This is a government that takes action and we have taken decisive action to build on the foundations of our successes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757739">As I said, our economy is strong, the fiscal fundamentals are in place and we have an ambitious plan, Advantage Canada, that will take us where we want to go. We have chartered a prosperous course for Canada's future and we will stick to it.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="757755">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to participate in this debate today. I would like to mention that I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78912" Type="2">Churchill</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757756">As many of my friends opposite will know, when the last election campaign took place, I was not a proud member of the federal Liberal Party. I actually campaigned as a member of the Conservative Party and I spent a considerable amount of time knocking on doors. In fact, I actually knocked on around 25,000 doors over the course of eight or nine months during my campaign. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757757">As I was knocking on doors, I had a great opportunity, of course, as other members do, to actually talk to individuals and families in their homes and find out what they cared about. I found that many people in my particular riding had not elected a Conservative since 1993. In fact, I was the last Conservative to represent that riding and there I was in 2005 campaigning again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757758">I found there was hesitation among people in the riding about the current <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. They did not mind the Conservative brand from what they knew from the past, but they had a few reservations about how this new Conservative Party would actually pan out. When people raised these questions with me I said, “Don't worry. I can assure you, my friends, that this new Conservative Party will be moderate, mainstream, middle of the road, and at its very core it has concerns about the economy, good economic management”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757759">I told people, “Don't worry, this party gets it. It understands the pressures that families are under today, it understands the concerns that people have about rising taxes. It is the party of prudent spending and economic management”. I said that and I did not give people any hint whatsoever as to what they could end up expecting. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757760">What did they find? They found higher income taxes. No one told me about that when I was a Conservative candidate. Nobody told me to go to people's doorsteps and say, “If you vote for me, I will raise your income taxes”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757761">When I knocked on doors I had something called “Stand up for Canada”, which had a section in it called “Security for Seniors”. In that section it said, “We will not make life harder for senior citizens, senior investors”. I knocked on their doors and when they asked me, “Are you guys going to look after our savings”, I said, “Absolutely. The prime minister to be gets it. This new Conservative Party understands”. I did not tell them that we would go back as Conservatives and rob their savings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757762">When people said to me, “I have all my money in my house. Do you understand that? Do you guys understand that the repository of net family worth in this country is now residential real estate? Do you get it”, I said, “Absolutely. We will pursue prudent economic management policies that will not be inflationary, that will not trigger the Bank of Canada having to raise its key lending rate, which will translate into you having a higher mortgage rate”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757763">They asked me about inflation and I said, “Don't worry about that. There is no way that I think this government is going to overspend. This is a Conservative government, not like those Liberals over there who know how to mind the dollars. They will not overspend”. At the end of the day, I would have trouble going back to those people if I were a Conservative. I would have had serious trouble going back. I would have to say to those people, “I basically lied to you. I basically told you that the economic situation would be handled when it was not”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757764">I want to run through a couple of points before I get to some solutions because that is what Liberals are all about. We are about solutions. We are about solving problems. We are about giving people a sound, bright economic future. That is what everybody in the House ought to be concentrating on, not hurling mud.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757765">I have to say a few things about what has happened regarding government spending. To me, there is nothing that represents failure on the part of government more than governments who overspend. It is a crime. I never thought I would see a Conservative government spend the way it is spending. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757766">The government is spending more money in the current budget and projected in next year's budget than any other government in Canadian history, of any flavour, of any stripe. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757767">In fact, government spending right now is increasing by double the inflation rate. That is a pretty serious issue. The consequences of that are extremely clear. When government spending is increasing by double the rate of inflation, it ends up itself being inflationary.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="757768">The government accounts for a significant part of GDP. As that happens it triggers an increase in the core inflation rate. As all hon. members know, the Bank of Canada tries to maintain an inflation rate of between 1% and 3% and right now we are at the top of that and bumping over. Economists agree that a very significant part of that is government spending. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757769">As the Bank of Canada increases its inflationary range and exceeds it, then it has to have interest rate increases. Those interest rate increases are now impacting on families because they have also inflated our currency. Our Canadian dollar's rise to parity is certainly influenced by the inflationary tendencies we have seen from government spending and the Bank of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757770">Now there is more pressure on families because mortgage rates are rising. In fact, key mortgage rates went up by half a point just a few days ago. With the record level of mortgage debt in this country with Canadians never having been as indebted as they are today, a half point increase in mortgage rates actually matters. It matters to people in my riding. In the 905 area, where houses are expensive, a half point is a big deal, and it need not have happened. It was fueled by the Conservative government. That is one pressure on families in my riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757771">A secondary pressure on families is taxes. When I was knocking on doors in my constituency, I never told my people that their income taxes were going to rise because I did not believe it. The basic income tax rate in this country dropped to 15% in November 2005 in the last Liberal budget. I never imagined that a Conservative <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and a Conservative government would actually raise that, but they did.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757772">People ask me why I am upset because it is only half a point. A half point increase in the bottom income tax rate translates into $2.8 billion. That is $2.8 billion that we are taking right out of the hides of Canadian taxpayers and sending to Ottawa. I do not think that is what any of them actually bargained for or voted for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757773">Then of course there are the 2.2 million seniors who owned income trusts. We know that story so I will not go over it in detail. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757774">I went to a rally in Burlington, Ontario, as a Conservative candidate during the 2005-06 election campaign. I stood right behind the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> as he stood at the podium. He looked into the teleprompter and promised once again that he would never tax income trusts, and he did. Some $20 billion in the value of retirement savings, the capitalization of income trusts, basically vaporized because the income trust had been decimated by that commitment to tax it. Shame.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757775">Also, and perhaps more significantly, $26 billion worth of Canadian companies have been sold, many of them to foreign interests, because they were worth pennies on the dollar because of the income trust decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757776">Worse still, the Government of Canada said it was going to raid seniors' investments and take their income trusts because it was afraid of tax leakage. It did that because we have a robust income trust sector in Canada and the Government of Canada would see fewer dollars in terms of revenue. What has happened a year later? We know the facts. The Government of Canada suffered a $900 million tax loss because of the disappearance of these companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757777">This is not all about problems; it is about solutions. We are also about solutions. Obviously, with an electoral campaign being forced upon us by the Conservatives, which will be here shortly, our platform will be revealed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757778">We do not believe that the GST cut is necessarily the best way to deliver the next tax cut. We think it is best through broad-based income tax cuts, which will put more dollars in the pockets of families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757779">Second, we want less government spending. With less government spending, we will have a drop in interest rates and that is definitely going to help families.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="757780">Third, we want an industrial strategy that addresses seriously foreign takeovers and also helps the automobile sector. Included in that is a corporate tax cut.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757781">Fourth, we want broad based family tax reform and reductions. There is a number of things that we will be proposing there. Also, we have a demographic time bomb in this country with many people who today are truly going to need the kind of help the Liberal Party is offering.</ParaText>

We never thought that would happen because the Prime Minister told us it would not. I mean we foolishly believed him. We believed the man.

              <ParaText id="757795">However, this member has the nerve to stand here today and say he did not vote to support income splitting on pensions because of the tax on income trusts, and yet he voted for the Conservative government's income trust motion.

Part of the excitement in the House may be because he does have a conviction around these issues. That is important for Canadians to hear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757803">I am especially pleased to participate in this discussion today, this opposition day motion, because we are talking about what affects all Canadians. It certainly affects my riding and people within my riding. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757804">I represent a large rural riding. There are dozens and dozens of communities in my riding. Those communities include two cities and dozens of towns and first nations. When we talk about the economy and all the measures that affect Canadians, we look forward to creating a vision that will respond to all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757805">What are we talking about in terms of social impacts and people? We have heard that from some of the members. In fact, a member talked about people at the door, what they talked about and how they felt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757806">One of the major concerns I hear from the people in my riding is the disparity gap between Canadians. We are talking about income equality, the gap between the rich and the poor. What is the reality check? That this has been growing faster in the last decade than at any time in the last 30 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757807">In 2004 the richest 10% of Canadian families, raising children under 18, earned 82 times more than the poorest 10%. In fact, the after tax gap is at a record high. We talk about unemployment being at a record low, the lowest in 30 years. However, this is at a record high, the highest it has been at any time in 30 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757808">These are the concerns of Canadians, 65% of whom say they are not benefiting from economic growth. They feel income and wealth are getting concentrated at the top and so is power, leaving too many behind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757809">I thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="78387" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation> for his leadership in putting forward the motion today. It speaks to the continuation of the modern Liberal Party's history and leadership of fiscal responsibility. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757810">When the Liberals took office in 1993, they inherited a disastrous financial picture from the previous Conservative government. Canada was a country with enormous debt and it was completely out of control. Our nation was at the point of a national fiscal crisis and the future appeared bleak. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757811">Fortunately, through the 1990s and through decisions which were very difficult and tough to make, the Liberals delivered budget after budget of sound fiscal planning by consistently paying down the debt. Canada soon became a model for fiscal responsibility on the international stage, with the best book at the G-8. Most other advanced industrial countries began to take notes from our Liberal policies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757812">On the other hand, getting Canada's debt under control was and still is a priority for Canadians, and it continues to be a fundamental priority for us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757813">As a result of the measures taken by the past Liberal government, Canada is now in an ideal state to strengthen Canada's competitiveness with new investments to drive greater Canadian productivity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757814">What are we talking about? We are talking about physical infrastructure and new technologies, particularly green technologies. For the members opposite, that has to do with environmental responsibility. The government has the ability to provide the leadership on environmentally friendly investments through tax incentives and public-private partnerships.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="757815">I represent a northern riding, and I know I said that before. However, the environment, before it even hit the national agenda, was a priority in my riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757816">Shortly after I was elected in January of 2006, I polled and surveyed the riding, and the environment was the number two concern of the people in the Churchill riding. That is because they live with the day to day impacts of global warming. The winter we campaigned was the warmest winter on record. People in my riding were well aware of that. They live on the land and they play on the land.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757817">We also need to be making investments in research and development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757818"> One of the members mentioned poverty. I do not know if I have ever heard that word from across the House. We talk about an anti-poverty campaign. How are we going to do that? We have to invest in our children. We have to invest in the future. We have to invest in the minds of the youth in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757819">We are talking about research and development and post-secondary education. If the Conservative government would actually listened to Canadians, it would hear the need for investment in training and enhancing our skilled workforce.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757820">I am not alone in the House, representing a northern riding. Many of us have booming economies in mining and hydro development, yet we have a shortage of a skilled labour force. We do not even have the ability, as a country, to meet the aged-out population. As these baby boomers start to retire, we do not even have the ability to fulfill that labour market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757821">The government must invest in our youth. The government must lower corporate taxes, which will allow businesses to reinvest in new capital, while attracting fresh foreign investment in new business. We are fortunate to have a healthy and productive workforce in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757822">With this in mind, the government must take responsibility and leadership to foster an environment that will enhance the opportunity to provide all Canadians with a strong future. In the era of budgetary surpluses, brought in by sound Liberal policies, Canadian families must reap the direct benefits through personal tax cuts. We have heard that many times today, yet the Conservative government raised personal income taxes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757823">The government must be held accountable and produce responsible and consistent policies. Unfortunately in this respect, the financial record of the Conservatives has been appalling. After attempting to hold themselves as the party of accountability, they broke a critical promise to seniors. In my riding, I had constituent after constituent write in about the income trust fiasco. This was a promise they had made to Canadians and it was a promise broken.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757824">After people working their entire lives, pinching pennies and saving for their retirements, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> went back on their words and announced the decision to tax income trusts. The decision wiped more than $25 billion in savings overnight from Canadians across the country. The Conservative government took advantage of the elderly. Canadians invested their money based on this promise and people's trust cost them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757825">The approach from the members opposite is dishonest and reprehensible, and the constituents in the Churchill riding deserve better. They deserve strong leadership and responsible government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757826">While claiming to speak for families, workers, the environment and Canada's aboriginal peoples, the past 20 months has resulted in cancelled child care agreements, a flawed softwood lumber deal, scrapped environmental programming and a death sentence for the Kelowna accord.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="757843">It was amusing today to read the motion by the Liberals when last night the Liberals gave the Conservatives what they cannot get from the electorate, and that is a majority in the House. How can they criticize when they cannot perform their own functions in Parliament?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757844">In some ways, though, the Liberals and the Conservatives come very close together. Really, we cannot expect much difference from them on economic policy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757845">The motion today, which talks about a number of things, may differentiate slightly on the details of how the Liberals would turn more money over to corporations, whether it is through income trusts or through more significant tax breaks for corporations, but they are after the same thing. They are together in this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757846">We do not see any trouble with their members moving from one side to the other, especially in the front benches where they really do have a great deal in common. They represent the interests of large corporations. They do not, in any way, represent the common people of this country, who, over the last 15 years, have been working more hours, getting paid less and are going into debt deeper and deeper. That is the situation for workers, ordinary people of this country. Both those parties follow the same line.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757847">The working families of Canada expect their MPs to do their jobs. Northerners expect that I will do my job, which means standing up to the wrong-headed approach that the government is taking. I am sure the voters in Nunavut and Yukon expect the same. I am sure the voters in the Yukon did not expect their MP to be a pamphlet writer here in the last few days for the Conservative Party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757848">In some respects, what we have to show Canadians today is a clear message. On many of the most important aspects of our work in Parliament, determining the breakdown of how the economy will work, the level of resources that we are demanding from different sectors, from people and from businesses, we are seeing that those two groups are very close together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757849">If the Liberals had done their work, they would know that between 1993 and 1997 they were the ones who cut billions of dollars from post-secondary education. When they finally put money back in, it did not make up the difference that had been created from the original cutbacks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757850">To add insult to injury, the Liberals in 2004 combined post-secondary education with all other federal-provincial transfers making it impossible to determine how much was really being provided by the federal government for post-secondary education. That was kind of a neat accounting trick but it does not give good government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757851">If the Liberals had done their work on this motion today, they would have known that the last Liberal budget of 2005 contained zero new dollars for physical infrastructure for our communities. If they had done their job, they would have known that under the last Liberal government federal spending on transportation infrastructure fell by 46%. That is not the road to long term productivity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757852">If the Liberals had done their work before presenting this motion today, they would have known that their plan for research and development, which is to give greater tax breaks to businesses, does not work. Without connecting the tax breaks to actual research and development investment, there is no way of ensuring that the additional funds flowing from the lower tax rates actually go to research and development.</ParaText>

In 20 years there has been no increase. This northern residence tax deduction could help productivity. Right now, throughout northern Canada, we have a tremendous productive zone making wealth for Canadians and fuelling the economy of southern Canada but the workers cannot afford to live there. The workers are not getting the kind of break that 20 years ago a previous Conservative government thought was a good idea for northerners. We have not seen any change in that amount over those 20 years.</ParaText>

It was at $500,000 and they put it up to $750,000. They should look at all aspects of fairness in the system and, when they do, they will see that the northern residence tax deduction has suffered the same fate under the Liberals over those many years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757861">One aspect of the economy that was not mentioned in the throne speech and is not in the Liberals' motion is energy, the development and use of energy, and yet this issue is the largest single issue facing Canada and the world right now.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="757889">Mr. Speaker, I want you to imagine what you could do with $60 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757890">Canada is a relatively large country with a very small population. We need more children in Canada. We need a vibrant economy. Yesterday was child care workers appreciation day. We do know that it takes a village to raise a child. We also know that early learning and child care is critically important. The first six years of a child's life is the time when the child is learning and the child's brain is developing the most. We need to invest to help young people, our children, to learn. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757891">One would think that Canada would be investing in early childhood education and yet that is not what I see. On a day that is supposed to appreciate child care workers, I note that those very dedicated workers have an average income of $23,000. There are child care workers in my riding in Toronto who say that $23,000 is not enough money to take care of their own kids and still be able to pay the rent. Imagine earning $23,000 today. Child care workers have two years of early childhood education training. They have a college diploma. Yet still they make $23,000 a year. That is a very low wage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757892">As a result there is a large turnover in child care workers. The quality of early learning and child care is not improving. Here in Canada we are at the bottom of the heap. We have the lowest dollar amount of investment in all of the OECD countries. It is a shame that we are at the bottom of the heap. Not only is that a problem but there is a very huge multinational corporation involved in child care, called ABC Learning Centres, from Australia. It is organized and owned by a person nicknamed Fast Eddie. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757893">The corporation has seen an opportune moment. It has a different name in Canada, 1,2,3 Busy Beaver, or something like that. That corporation is beginning to take over a lot of the child care operations in Canada. It is trying to buy them up. We are beginning to see big box child care in Canada. Why is that a problem? In Australia, for example, since the big box child care operation has come onto the scene, non-profit child care centres, mom and pop operations are being taken over by the company ABC Learning Centres. As a result, the wages and quality of service have gone down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757894">In Canada we need to invest in early childhood education from the funding from taxes. We need to have a legislative framework in the form of Bill <Document DbId="3073187" Type="4">C-303</Document> to say that the kind of services we are developing in Canada have to be non-profit. The 10 years of corporate tax cuts represent at least $60 billion. Each year we are losing $13 billion that could be invested in early childhood education. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="757895"> Not only should we invest in early childhood education, but we absolutely need to invest in young people. It is correct to say that in the last 10 years a lot of cuts have been made to post-secondary education. Tuition fees are putting tremendous pressure on many families. Young people in universities are struggling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757896">We need a new grants program in order to make post-secondary education more affordable. We need to expand the eligibility criteria for the debt reduction in repayment program. We have to increase federal transfers to the provinces to reduce tuition fees. We have to increase funding to support aboriginal students. We need to look at what kind of grant program we can offer to young people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757897">If we are looking at productivity and investing in our future, we also have to look at investing in immigrants. We have to bring more immigrants to this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757898">I note the motion says that we have to deal with the foreign credential problem. This problem has been around for many years. We bring in new immigrants and yet we do not recognize their degrees. As a result, a lot of talent and skill is being wasted in this country. The Conference Board of Canada has said that we are losing at least $1 billion in earnings because new immigrants are not able to practise the profession they had in their home country. On the one hand we do not have enough nurses and doctors especially in our rural areas, and on the other hand, we are saying to these nurses and doctors that they cannot practise their profession in Canada. That is a waste of talent in this country. No wonder our productivity is slipping.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757899">There has been a lot of debate today about how more corporate tax cuts by some magical means would increase our productivity. A graph would show that for the last 10 years our corporate tax rates have declined from 28% to 21%. Those rates will go down to 18.5% by 2011. That is a huge amount of money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757900">One would think that our productivity would be rising based on the kind of theory that is being thrown out by the Liberals and the Conservatives, but it is not. It has not increased because we are not investing in our young people, we are not investing in our children, and we are not investing in average Canadian families. We are not even investing in research and development. Those are the reasons that our productivity is dropping.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757901">We are also not bringing enough immigrants into this country. One per cent of our population is supposed to be made up of immigrants, and yet over the last 10 years we have never brought anywhere close to 320,000 immigrants into this country. At most, we have brought in 260,000 or 265,000 immigrants. Canada needs more people. We need more young families. We need to invest in them and yet we are not doing so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757902">We are having this very artificial debate today about the GST, about the corporate tax cuts. What is the difference between the Liberals and the Conservatives? Both parties are saying they will cut the corporate tax rate by 2% each year. There has been no change. That direction was started by the former Liberal government in 2000, and the Conservative government is just continuing with that trend.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757903">With that $60 billion, not only could we invest in children, in new immigrants, and in young people, but we could also invest in our cities, in our crumbling infrastructure, the environment, in energy, to retrofit homes, in farmers, and in artists. There is so much we could do. This is a missed opportunity.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="757904">Mr. Speaker, I did notice that my colleague referred to the whole issue of Canada supporting its children. I think she encouraged Canadians to have more children. I do not know if I misunderstood her, but I think I am correct that she was encouraging Canadians to have more children. Children are good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757905">However, she also focused on what she alleged to be a shortcoming in our government's approach to serving children. She decried the fact that we do not have a national day care program, institutionalized day care funded by the state.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757906">My concern is this. The hon. member well knows that the large majority of Canadian children do not take advantage of day care. They have other models of care. For example, in my riding there is a large Indo-Canadian community. Many Indo-Canadian families have an intergenerational model of care, where the parents live with their children. The children go to work. The grandparents take care of the grandchildren. That is a different model. Others have stay at home parents, like we did. My wife was able to stay at home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757907">Yet the model that the member's party, the NDP, has promoted for many, many years is one which essentially has excluded those other models of child care. The NDP just like the institutionalized day care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757908">Why is it that for so many years her party has focused on that one group of children, but have omitted to address the needs of the majority of young children in our country?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="757909">Mr. Speaker, we know that 70% of mothers work. As a result, their kids, the children of working families, need to be taken care of by someone. Yes, there are some grandparents who can take care of the kids. My mother, for example, still lives in the house and when our kids were young, she occasionally assisted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757910"> However, not every family is blessed with grandparents. Grandparents also from time to time have other needs. Grandparents also need support, which is why part of the child care program that we have been talking about is not just about child care from 9 to 5; it is also about a drop-in centre, a resource centre, so that the grandparents can meet with other grandparents with their grandkids in a school setting, for example. There would be a toy library, a place where they could share some ideas, where the kids could sing songs together and grandparents could talk to each other. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757911">That kind of community based support is critically important, but it requires funding. Funding is needed to buy toys, funding to have a coordinated effort, funding for the grandfathers and grandmothers, for example, when they need to do something else so there would be some other kind of support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757912">Right now that choice is not available. There are thousands of families waiting for high quality, affordable child care. Your party recognized that because you said that you wanted 125,000 spaces created. </ParaText>

This is why, after 13 years of broken Liberal promises, this government has acted to improve the temporary foreign worker program and has instituted the foreign credential recognition secretariat so that finally the talents of new Canadians and foreign workers can be fully realized.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757933">In fact, demand in the improved temporary foreign worker program has skyrocketed. In Alberta alone, the number of employer requests has increased by 200% over the same six month period last year.</ParaText>

In fact, statistics show that among adult Canadians with disabilities in 2001, only 29% received some form of post-secondary education. That is simply unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757965">Today, our economic circumstances are providing us with a unique opportunity and a responsibility to improve that statistic. Governments, businesses and post-secondary institutions have an opportunity to help in ways that really make a difference in the lives of each individual.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757966">As a country we have a responsibility to do everything we can to succeed. For example, our government has invested $223 million to support programs delivered by the provinces and territories that help people with disabilities find and keep meaningful employment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757967">During the 13 years of Liberal rule, the total percentage of aboriginal Canadians with any kind of post-secondary education was only about 38%, a full 15% below the population as a whole. This disparity is reflected in the overall unemployment rate of aboriginals across the country, which stands at 19%, compared to the national rate of 5.9%. This government must and will do better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757968">In fact, we have already begun to act. Budget 2007 committed to more than doubling the size of the aboriginal skills and employment partnership program over five years, a program that really has produced results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757969">A university education is not right for everyone, nor will it answer all of our labour market needs going forward. The right people will find great success in the skilled trades, trades which are facing increased shortages across the country. An apprenticeship program is key to giving these people the tools they need to succeed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757970"> That is why this government launched the apprenticeship incentive grant. Now, up to 100,000 apprentices can receive grants to help cover the cost of tuition, travel and tools in the first two years of this red seal trade program. This is real action and it is already getting real results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757971">This is our record. It is in stark contrast to the record of the former Liberal government. Like they have on so many other issues, the Liberals claim to stand up for students, for new Canadians, for education and for skills training, but their record is one of cuts and inaction.</ParaText>

However, right now in his department the only way that a young person could get employment is for the young person to be out of school full time or out of work full time. Ordinary young teenagers, for example, who want to find a decent job after school will not benefit at all from the minister's department.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="757996">Mr. Speaker, one of the best ways to tackle the prosperity gap is to ensure that people have good skills. I point out that in a world when labour shortages are not only looming but are actually here. We find that in many sectors wages are rising and rising very dramatically. The key is to ensure that people who do not have adequate training or whose skills are no longer relevant get the training. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757997">That is why we have invested as heavily as we have. We see that as being a key to growth. It is not just training. It is also post-secondary education and I have touched on the large investments we have made there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757998">With respect to the issue of child care, I point out to my friend that we have a different view of it. We ran in the election on a particular platform that included providing choice to parents for child care and we were elected on that platform. We have implemented the universal child care benefit, which will benefit almost two million children in the current year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="757999">I note that the leader of the Liberal Party says he would take that away. He does not seem to believe that parents should get that funding and that speaks volumes about his own lack of faith in the ability of parents to raise their children. Therefore, I think the member has some answering to do to explain why the Liberal Party feels that way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758000"> I also want to point out that it was the deputy leader of the Liberal Party, Sheila Copps, who said not long ago that the previous government did not create any spaces with its plan. I note that since we made our investment of $250 million, bringing the total benefit to the provinces every year to $1.1 billion, the provinces have announced the creation of thousands and thousands of new spaces. We are happy to work cooperatively with them to produce those kinds of results.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="758001">Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="78713" Type="2">Vancouver Centre</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758002">I have enjoyed the debate today because it does paint a picture of a government that is more interested in not governing. Since that party was elected, it has spent more time campaigning than it has in fact governing. It really is a shame because it politicizes the legislative process in a way that is not helpful to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758003">I want to talk about two aspects. Members have indicated very clearly the scope of the motion. There are a couple of elements that I wanted to address in my brief 10 minutes. Number one is the whole idea of access to post-secondary education. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758004">In my work as a member I have spent a fair bit of time looking at the implications for Canada, to the health of our country and to the knowledge based economy, of an education and what it means in terms of employment levels. The last figures that I saw, and there may be more recent, but just to give an idea of the relative dimension, indicate that among high school drop outs the unemployment rate today is somewhere around 15%. For those having a high school education, that drops to about 12%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758005">Among those having a post-secondary degree or equivalent, or some skills training or college training, the unemployment rate actually drops to about 3% to 4%. Depending on the nature, sometimes even down to a fraction of a per cent in certain disciplines. It is pretty clear that there is a correlation between levels of education and the ability to gain good and secure employment in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758006">The other aspect of it is the starting salary for people who have jobs at different levels of education. The difference between a high school graduate and a university or college graduate is somewhere in the range of $5,000 to $7,000 at the starting level. That in fact would grow over the life of the person's working career. The bottom line that I concluded is that our young people in Canada cannot afford not to go to post-secondary institutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758007">I was delighted to meet today with representatives of the Canadian Federation of Students and one of the young people was one of my constituents. I want to give him recognition. His name is Walied Khogali. This young man is a leader in the student community at the University of Toronto, Mississauga campus. He is tremendously articulate. He has visions for his future, but he is working here on Parliament Hill along with many other students who are talking to members of Parliament about the access to post-secondary education and some of the ways in which we can do this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758008">I was very impressed with their understanding about the implications or how the rubber hits the road, how the dollars hit the road, whether it be from the millennium scholarship fund, the Canada health and social transfer, where there is a post-secondary component, or the Canada student loans program. They have ideas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758009">I was very impressed. I was encouraged and I told them right off the bat that they have my full support because I honestly believe that young people cannot afford not to go to post-secondary institutions in order to be full participants in a successful economy of Canada. We need them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758010">I want to move to the second item and it has to do with something that I have talked a lot about in this place. It has to do with income trusts. I think that there has been a lot of rhetoric and a lot of generalization, but I thought it would be helpful to maybe say a couple of words about what happened there. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="50">(1750)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="758011">On Halloween, October 31 of last year, the<Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4"> finance minister</Affiliation> announced that there would be a 31.5% tax on income trusts at the company level.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758012">People ask what an income trust is and how that compares to corporations. In fact, we have heard people say that every company should pay its fair share of taxes but income trusts do not pay taxes so there must be something wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758013">Let me tell members something. If I am an investor in a corporation like Microsoft, it pays dividends. Microsoft pays corporate taxes. When it pays the dividends, the recipient, the shareholder, the individual, also pays taxes on the dividend income, and they get from Canada a dividend tax credit. There are some taxes collected at the corporate level and there are some taxes collected on the dividend income they receive, at a substantially lower rate than employment income. There are two sources of income.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758014">Income trusts, which are another form of business, are set up where under certain criteria prescribed under tax law they do not pay tax at the company level. They in fact distribute all of their profits to the holders. Those holders then include that in their income as if it were equivalent to employment income. It is paid at the highest marginal rate for them. So even though the income trust company itself does not pay tax, the individuals are paying much more than they would have if those moneys were received as dividends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758015">Thus, we have to talk about the revenue impacts to the Government of Canada from the company level as well as the personal. We cannot just say that this company is not paying taxes so something is wrong. That is a very silly argument.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758016">When the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> put the 31.5% tax on the table and said that it was going to be effective down the road, $25 billion of the market value of those investments went down. Twenty-five billion dollars in the market value of those investments was lost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758017">It is interesting to note that the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> has said in the media, and I talked to him yesterday and reaffirmed his position, that as far as he was concerned there is no loss on that investment until it is actually sold.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758018">I have to tell members that when I do my net worth statement, if my shares are worth so much on the market, it is the market value, and I can tell members that the implication of the 31.5% tax is that the amount of income that the income trust company has to distribute to its investors is less because it pays this 31.5% tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758019">I also can tell members that the people who invest in income trusts are not people who have registered pension plans and are getting pensions. Most of them are seniors. The reason they like income trusts is that income trusts pay out the money monthly and that means they have a regular cashflow to pay their bills and to do everything that they need. The cashflow is there just as if they had a pension. It emulates a pension plan. The amount they are getting is a lot less because there is less money to distribute from the income trust.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758020">I think it is important to know that it is not just a matter of whether or not my shares or my investment went down. The <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> seems to think that people do not have a loss until they sell. However, I can tell members about this situation. It will be the one year anniversary of this decision on Halloween. Over the last year, the value of the stock market actually has gone up substantially, perhaps by 14% or 15%, and many of those income trusts actually are back at the same level they were the prior October.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758021"> Everybody perhaps would argue that people did not lose anything, so they are right back where they were. The problem is that everything else in the marketplace also went up 15% and they have not moved. The proof of that lies in what would happen if we repealed the 31.5% tax. There is no question about it. The value of income trusts on the stock market would go up to reflect the fact that they are not going to have that burden.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758022">I hope there is some understanding here.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="758023">The last point I would like to make is that the government also said it is going to introduce seniors' pension income splitting for 2007. I can tell members that only 30% of seniors actually have a registered pension income from a company, et cetera. When we take out the number of those seniors who do not have a partner to split with, or whose income is less than $37,000 a year and are already in the lowest bracket, that means they get no benefit. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="758024">Mr. Speaker, I note that the member talked a lot about seniors. In my latest research I have found that almost three out of every 10 Canadian families have no pension savings, which means that they have no company plan and no RRSPs. Almost two-thirds of families with incomes below $30,000 have no pension savings. Let us imagine that. In a few years' time these folks are going to be retiring and they have no pension backup plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758025">Given that we have not really increased either the GIS or the OAS in a way that would lift some seniors out of poverty, what plan do we have to assist these seniors, especially when nursing care, home care, and nursing homes are so unaffordable and when a lot of that care is not high quality? It is something that we as a country have to deal with. What kind of plan do we have in front of us that would assist these families?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="758026">Mr. Speaker, I certainly do agree that there are numbers of people who, for whatever reason, were not able to put away enough to provide for their retirement years, for emergencies or for very expensive chronic care assistance, et cetera. This is why it is so very important that we support our social programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758027">We need to understand that there are people in our society who are unable to care for themselves, but I can tell the member that this is not the Conservative view. The Conservative view is that everybody has to fend for themselves. That is not right. It is not right to say that if someone cannot take care of themselves then that is their problem. It is not right to say that it is not our problem. We do not want a government that does not support people with a good, solid social program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758028">As I was indicating with regard to those income trusts, when we take out all the people who have no partner to split with and who are already at the lowest marginal rate, the total percentage of seniors that gets any benefit from income splitting is very small. It is somewhere around 4% of seniors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758029">What the government did with those income trusts is absolutely outrageous. In regard to the plan to eliminate the 31.5% tax, replace it with a 10% tax and make it refundable to Canadians so that only non-residents of Canada, who are the most significant beneficiaries of this plan, would be paying the tax, that is fair to Canadians. It deals with the problem the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> has identified. He did not have to use a 31.5% tax. A 10% tax would have done it. If we do that, I am hoping that we will be able to recover about two-thirds of the lost investment value of the hard-earned savings of seniors, savings that were lost when he imposed that tax.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="758031">There is another issue about which I was reading today. Every economist in this country says that bringing down the GST does not help. In fact, when the Conservative government brought in the GST cut of 1% in the last budget, people were asking where it went. It went toward increasing taxes for the lowest income tax bracket.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="758033">Mr. Speaker, in the first budget the government increased the lowest tax rate from 15% to 15.5%. That cost the average Canadian $400. As for reducing the GST by 1%, a family has to spend $40,000 a year to get back to even. Who has $40,000 a year to spend? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758034">That benefit is only for high income earners. A second cut is simply going to add to the benefit of the highest income earners in Canada, not the lowest. That is the difference between Liberals and Conservatives.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="758036">Mr. Speaker, rising to speak to this motion is an extremely important task for me, because it speaks very much to what is a vision for this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758037">When we talk about economic policy and economic vision, there is more to it than decreasing taxes or bringing in tax credit programs--especially if one does not pay taxes in the first place because one does not get the benefit of that program--or reducing corporate taxes or reducing debt. These are important pieces obviously in looking at economic growth, looking at the economy, and as a basis for good economic policy, but economic policy is not only about that. One needs to invest in the things that would improve productivity and competitiveness in a nation. This is what Liberals have understood.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758038">The Conservative government inherited an extremely sound economy from the Liberal Party which was in government for 13 years. The debt decreased. We had nine balanced budgets in a row. We went from being a second world nation to being the number one nation in the world in terms of economic growth and economic strength.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758039">The Conservatives were handed this gift and now we know there is a huge surplus, but the question is, are they going fritter it away or are they going to use it to invest wisely in creating a vision for Canada that in a global economy actually will deal with the greatest challenge that we face? That would be the challenge of productivity and competitiveness. How do we not just sustain an economy but how do we build one in a world in which the economy is now globally driven? Given that we are competing against China, India, the European Union and the United States and we only have 31.5 million people in this country, we have to think about being smart.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758040">In order to deal with productivity and competiveness, there are investments that need to be made in Canadians that I have not heard about from the Conservative government at all. I want to touch on three of them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758041">One of them has to do with the fact that in this post-industrial era, and we are in a post-industrial era. At least I hope Canada is and that Canada does not want to go back to the old industrial era and try to compete against the countries that are actually developing themselves now. If we want to deal in the post-industrial era, we need to think about it as an era of innovation and creativity, an era in which human capital is going to be one of the most important investments that we can make.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758042">So we have to have the best and the brightest in this country. We want people to come to Canada because they know that they are going to find the workforce they want. They are going to find it here. We have to be bright. We are going to be the ones who have well-trained and well-educated people in this country. This is going to be our most important tool.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758043">The second most important thing that we need to do is to know that one can come to a country, and that this country is going to be functioning in the era of innovation. It means that we need to invest in people, in skills, in training and in post-secondary education.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758044">Liberals understood that. We invested. In 2005 we made labour market agreements with the provinces totalling $3.5 billion. That has disappeared under the Conservative government. It is gone. No one knows where it is. We had actually developed a 50:50 program to assist students who were getting a bachelor's degree in paying for their first year and their fourth year, paying for it, not lending it, but giving it, the first year so that the young person would be encouraged to go into post-secondary training and the final year to encourage the young person to stay until the training was over. This was a 50% reduction in the cost of post-secondary education. Again, it was about access to education, skills and training.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758045">Statistics Canada tells us that by 2011 we will be dependent for 100% of our net labour force on immigration and on new workers. We know that the Conservatives have done little. The Conservative government has done little to deal with that issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758046">The Liberal government in 2005 put in $263 million to deal with the issue of the internationally trained worker who was trained somewhere else and needed to work in this country. In 2006 we had earmarked another $290 million for that as well.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="758047">The 2005 fund of $263 million was cut by the government to $13 million over two years. The 2006 fund of $290 million was cut to $23 million over two years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758048">What do we do when internationally trained workers, who are underemployed and unemployed with regard to their skills and training, are unable to find credential recognition, which albeit is a provincial jurisdiction, and are unable to find first jobs? They go into the three big cities of the country. They need language training.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758049"> The first job given to me by the last prime minister was to develop a medium and long term strategy to allow for all internationally trained workers in Canada to work and find jobs commensurate with their skills.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758050"> It was a very complex issue. We had to deal with the five challenges that they faced. We had to work with provinces. We had to develop relationships between municipalities. We had to work with credentialing bodies. We set out this complex plan. With the money the we had 2005 and 2006, we started to work with the private sector and all our partners. That money has disappeared.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758051">We now have an information kiosk. People who are internationally trained and cannot find work can go to this kiosk to get information. They do not need information. They need assistance in learning the language, in doing their exams and in finding jobs. Businesses need assistance and infrastructure money to help to pay for them to come into their businesses as apprentices. A number of initiatives need to be done. There is nothing is there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758052">We do not understand. If we do not have a trained population, we will not make it. All they are doing is treading water for the next two or three years by just making tax cuts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758053">The second thing that I wanted to talk about was the era of innovation and creativity. We are now hearing from places in the United States, from Harvard, MIT and Stanford University. They are incorporating in their business schools arts and culture. They are beginning to realize that innovation, science and technology, business and arts and culture are now all merging, in this new era of information and of innovation and creativity, to become the bulwark of a 21st century economy that is going to be competitive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758054">Nothing in the Speech from the Throne spoke of investments in arts and culture. It is seen as a warm fuzzy, whereas the Liberals began by investing in innovation when we came into government. In 1997 Canada was at the bottom of the barrel in the world in terms of investment in innovation and in research and development. Since then, we have invested over $13 billion, which in turn has generated equivalent amounts of money from the private sector to create what is today one of the top five countries in the world from which people believe Nobel Prize laureates will come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758055">Eighteen hundred brains had left Canada to go somewhere else. They returned, bringing with them the brains from other countries. Canada is now seen as a country where innovation, creativity, research and development is happening. We are on the cusp of new discoveries all the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758056">In arts and culture, we have just discovered something very important that has huge value to the world. I do not know how many members saw the film <I>300</I>, but that whole film was made on a green screen. Everyone thinks there were millions of people running around and doing things in the background. Yet it is a piece of technology developed by Canada that will change the film industry in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758057"> That is money in our bank. That is creativity. That is innovation. There is nothing here about investing in that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758058">Finally, there is infrastructure. We have to help people to get an education. We need innovation and creativity. Finally, we need the physical and the digital infrastructure in the country to make it move. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="758059">We started by working with the municipalities. Municipalities today have a $100 billion deficit. If we to be a trading nation and move on trade with Asia-Pacific and the rest of the world, we need the physical railroads, bridges and infrastructure. The Liberals started a Pacific gateway infrastructure. We began to build it. By now we would have finished it. Yet it was lengthened and expanded to 2013 by the Conservative government. By the time we get to Asia-Pacific, everyone else will have come and gone.</ParaText>
