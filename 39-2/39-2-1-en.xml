              <ParaText id="749939">Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege. It may be that today the spin doctors and the media manipulators have gone too far.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="749940">A number of media outlets, including the Canadian Press, the CBC and others are reporting that copies of the Speech from the Throne, which members of Parliament are about to hear in the other place, were leaked to the media across Ottawa more than two hours in advance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="749941">Copious details have been discussed in news broadcasts ever since without the knowledge of members of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="749942">This is a flagrant contempt of Parliament. Parliament needs to know exactly who was engaged in this improper and premature release of the throne speech. Was it accidental? If not, who authorized it and at what level will the responsibility be shouldered?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="749943">Mr. Speaker, the references in Marleau and Montpetit and in Maingot are very clear. I will not trouble you with the details now, but I am happy to make those citations later if you require them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="749944">However, I want to assure you, Mr. Speaker, that if you find a prima facie case of privilege in this case, that the details of a throne speech have been prematurely leaked in advance, then I would be prepared to move the appropriate motion.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="749945">Mr. Speaker, I believe that everyone is quite familiar that the government would genuinely be concerned about any suggestion that there had been any premature leak of the throne speech. I saw the same reports that the Liberal House leader saw and was very troubled by them myself, as I know was everyone in our government troubled by them. It is not our practice to leak, in any case, and I think everyone is well aware of the practice of the government in that regard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="749946">I will observe that sadly the leak coincided with perhaps just a few 15 minutes after those speeches were made available as they are on convention advanced to the other party leaders.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="749951">Order. It appears we have a few moments and to save time later I will inform members of something they are just aching to hear about now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="749952">As hon. members know, our Standing Orders provide for the continuance of private members' business from session to session within a Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="749953">The list for the consideration of private members' business established on April 7, 2006, continues from the last session to this session notwithstanding prorogation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="749954">As such, all items of private members' business originating in the House of Commons that were listed on the order paper during the previous session are reinstated to the order paper and shall be deemed to have been considered and approved at all stages completed at the time of prorogation of the first session.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="749955"> Generally speaking, in practical terms, this also means that those items on the Order of Precedence remain on the Order of Precedence or, as the case may be, are referred to committee or sent to the Senate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="749956"> However, there is one item that cannot be left on the Order of Precedence. Pursuant to Standing Order 87(1), Parliamentary secretaries who are ineligible by virtue of their office to be put on the Order of Precedence will be dropped to the bottom of the list for the consideration of private members' business, where they will remain as long as they hold those offices. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="749957"> Consequently, the item in the name of the member for <Affiliation DbId="78833" Type="2">Glengarry—Prescott—Russell</Affiliation>, Motion M-302, is withdrawn from the Order of Precedence.</ParaText>

I would like to address the first words in this chamber to the members of the Canadian Forces, some of whom are present here today. Their commitment and courage in the name of justice, equality and freedom—whose benefits are not accorded to all peoples in the world—are worthy of our utmost respect. 

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="749984">The Speech from the Throne is an important moment in our country’s democratic life. Through the Speech from the Throne, the Government shares its vision with Canadians. And it is thus that we open the Second Session of the Thirty Ninth Parliament today.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="749985">Fifty years ago, on October 14, 1957, during her first visit to Canada as its Sovereign, and for the first time in Canadian history, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II opened the First Session of the Twenty-Third Parliament.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="749986">This room is filled with history, and we mark history again this year as we celebrate a number of anniversaries. I think, in particular, of the bicentenary of the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act in the British Empire. I also think of the 60th anniversary of the adoption of the Citizenship Act on January 1, 1947. And I think of the 40th anniversary of the Order of Canada, whose one hundredth investiture ceremony we will soon be celebrating at Rideau Hall.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="749987">And although Canada is a young country, its history is marked by our unwavering willingness—which I was touched to see all across Canada—to be and to continue to be a generous society. A society that is concerned about the well being of others. A society that is protective of the spirit of this bountiful land, a deep respect learned from Aboriginal peoples. A society that is committed to finding solutions to today’s challenges. A society that is open to creation and quick to innovate. A society that is filled with young people who have an unprecedented openness to the world.

            <B>Strong Leadership. A Better Canada.

</B>
          </ParaText>
          <ParaText id="749989">Canada is the greatest country in the world, a nation of enormous potential built through the imagination and dedication of ordinary Canadians. Canadians who have worked hard to build a better life for their families. Canadians who have joined with their neighbours to create a society founded on peace and prosperity.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="749990">Canada is their legacy to us.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="749991">Canadians expect their government to help them build on this legacy. They want a government that sets clear goals and delivers concrete results. A government that is accountable. A government that puts Canadians and their families first.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="749992">Our Government has worked hard to meet these expectations. Canadians now have more money in their pockets because taxes have been cut. Families now have real choice in child care through the Universal Child Care Benefit. Canadians now have a government committed to helping them get the medical care they need more quickly. A government that is tackling crime and making neighbourhoods safer.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="749993">The results are clear: the economy is strong, the government is clean and the country is united. 

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="749994">Now is the time to continue building a better Canada. In the next session, our Government will focus on five clear priorities: strengthening Canada’s sovereignty and place in the world; building a stronger federation; providing effective economic leadership; continuing to tackle crime; and improving our environment.</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="749995">
            <B>Strengthening Canada’s Sovereignty and Place in the World</B>
          </ParaText>
          <ParaText id="749996">Canada is built on a common heritage of values, which Canadians have fought and died to defend. It is a country that continues to attract newcomers seeking refuge and opportunity, who see Canada as a place where they can work hard, raise families and live in freedom. Our Government is resolved to uphold this heritage by protecting our sovereignty at home and living by our values abroad.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="749997">The Arctic is an essential part of Canada’s history. One of our Fathers of Confederation, D’Arcy McGee, spoke of Canada as a northern nation, bounded by the blue rim of the ocean. Canadians see in our North an expression of our deepest aspirations: our sense of exploration, the beauty and the bounty of our land, and our limitless potential. 

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="749998">But the North needs new attention. New opportunities are emerging across the Arctic, and new challenges from other shores. Our Government will bring forward an integrated northern strategy focused on strengthening Canada’s sovereignty, protecting our environmental heritage, promoting economic and social development, and improving and devolving governance, so that northerners have greater control over their destinies.</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="749999"> 

To take advantage of the North’s vast opportunities, northerners must be able to meet their basic needs. Our Government will work to continue to improve living conditions in the North for First Nations and Inuit through better housing.</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750000">Our Government will build a world-class arctic research station that will be on the cutting edge of arctic issues, including environmental science and resource development. This station will be built by Canadians, in Canada’s Arctic, and it will be there to serve the world. 

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750001">As part of asserting sovereignty in the Arctic, our Government will complete comprehensive mapping of Canada’s Arctic seabed. Never before has this part of Canada’s ocean floor been fully mapped.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750002">Defending our sovereignty in the North also demands that we maintain the capacity to act. New arctic patrol ships and expanded aerial surveillance will guard Canada’s Far North and the Northwest Passage. As well, the size and capabilities of the Arctic Rangers will be expanded to better patrol our vast Arctic territory.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750003">Ensuring our capacity to defend Canada’s sovereignty is at the heart of the Government’s efforts to rebuild the Canadian Forces. Canada’s men and women in uniform risk their lives for their country, and deserve the equipment and training required for a first-class, modern military. Our Government will modernize Canada’s military to provide effective surveillance and protection for all of our country, cooperate in the defence of North America, and meet our responsibilities abroad to the United Nations and our allies. Further, recognizing the important role that the Reserves play in this modernization, our Government will work with the provinces and territories to bring forward a comprehensive plan to modernize reservist reinstatement policies.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750004">At the same time as our Government rebuilds to meet our future needs, it will continue to improve support for our veterans who have contributed so much to defending Canada in the past.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750005">Rebuilding our capabilities and standing up for our sovereignty have sent a clear message to the world: Canada is back as a credible player on the international stage. Our Government believes that focus and action, rather than rhetoric and posturing, are restoring our influence in global affairs. Guided by our shared values of democracy, freedom, human rights and the rule of law, our Government will continue Canada’s international leadership through concrete actions that bring results. 

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750006">A commitment to action means that Canada must make common cause with those fighting for the values we uphold. Our Government will immediately call upon Parliament to confer honorary citizenship on Aung San Suu Kyi. Her long struggle to bring freedom and democracy to the people of Burma has made her the embodiment of these ideals and an inspiration to all of us.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750007">Nowhere is Canada making a difference more clearly than in Afghanistan. Canada has joined the United Nations-sanctioned mission in Afghanistan because it is noble and necessary. Canadians understand that development and security go hand in hand. Without security, there can be no humanitarian aid, no reconstruction and no democratic development. Progress will be slow, but our efforts are bearing fruit. There is no better measure of this progress than the four million Afghan boys and two million girls who can dream of a better future because they now go to school.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750008">The Canadian Forces mission has been approved by Parliament until February 2009, and our Government has made clear to Canadians and our allies that any future military deployments must also be supported by a majority of parliamentarians. In the coming session, members will be asked to vote on the future of the Canadian mission in Afghanistan. This decision should honour the dedication and sacrifice of Canada’s development workers, diplomats and men and women in uniform. It should ensure that progress in Afghanistan is not lost and that our international commitments and reputation are upheld.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750009">Our Government does not believe that Canada should simply abandon the people of Afghanistan after February 2009. Canada should build on its accomplishments and shift to accelerate the training of the Afghan army and police so that the Afghan government can defend its own sovereignty. This will not be completed by February 2009, but our Government believes this objective should be achievable by 2011, the end of the period covered by the Afghanistan Compact. Our Government has appointed an independent panel to advise Canadians on how best to proceed given these considerations.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750010">In our own neighbourhood, the Americas, Canada is back playing an active role. The Canadian model of constitutional democracy and economic openness combined with social safety nets, equitable wealth creation and sharing across regions has much to offer those countries struggling to build a better future. 

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750011">Canada’s efforts in Haiti are a compelling example of how we can work with our neighbours to ensure security and development. Canadians understand that our country has a responsibility to help countries struggling to make a better life for their people—particularly in promoting democratic governance in fragile states. In Haiti and elsewhere, our Government will bring greater focus and effectiveness to Canada’s international assistance to ensure that Canadians’ money is well spent. 

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750012">The best hope for fostering development and our common security in the hemisphere and beyond is through bolstering international trade. Through renewed focus on trade and investment arrangements, Canada has already secured a deal with the European Free Trade Association, the first new agreement in more than half a decade. Our Government will keep advancing Canada’s trade interests in the Americas and around the world to open up new markets for Canada’s innovators.

            <B>Strengthening the Federation and our Democratic Institutions</B>
          </ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750014">Next year we mark important anniversaries spanning our country and its history. We will celebrate the 400th anniversary of the founding of Quebec City. Canada was born in French, reflected in the presence of francophones throughout Canada, and in Parliament’s recognition that the Québécois form a nation within our united country. We will also celebrate the 250th anniversary of the establishment of Nova Scotia’s representative assembly, which marks the birth of Canadian parliamentary democracy, and the 150th anniversary of the founding of the Crown Colony of British Columbia.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750015">John A. Macdonald, George-Étienne Cartier and the other Fathers of Confederation brought many peoples and regions together to create a federation that has served Canadians well for 140 years. Our Government is committed to strengthening that union: it has concentrated on its national role by reinvesting in neglected federal responsibilities, such as trade, defence, public safety and security. It has put fiscal relations with provinces and territories on a principled basis and increased the level of transfers to support quality health care and social services.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750016">Our Government believes that the constitutional jurisdiction of each order of government should be respected. To this end, guided by our federalism of openness, our Government will introduce legislation to place formal limits on the use of the federal spending power for new shared-cost programs in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. This legislation will allow provinces and territories to opt out with reasonable compensation if they offer compatible programs.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750017">Our Government will also pursue the federal government’s rightful leadership in strengthening Canada’s economic union. Despite the globalization of markets, Canada still has a long way to go to establish free trade among our provinces. It is often harder to move goods and services across provincial boundaries than across our international borders. This hurts our competitive position but, more importantly, it is just not the way a country should work. Our Government will consider how to use the federal trade and commerce power to make our economic union work better for Canadians.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750018">Canadians understand that the federation is only as strong as the democratic institutions that underpin it. Our Government believes that Canada is not well served by the Senate in its current form. To ensure that our institutions reflect our shared commitment to democracy, our Government will continue its agenda of democratic reform by reintroducing important pieces of legislation from the last session, including direct consultations with voters on the selection of Senators and limitations on their tenure. In addition, the integrity of our federal voting system will be further strengthened through measures to confirm the visual identification of voters.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750019">Our Government supports Canada’s linguistic duality. It will renew its commitment to official languages in Canada by developing a strategy for the next phase of the Action Plan for Official Languages.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750020">Our Government remains committed to improving the lives of Canada’s Aboriginal people. The Government will reintroduce legislation to guarantee to people living on reserve the same protections other Canadians enjoy under the Canadian Human Rights Act. Our Government will also present legislation on specific claims, which will finally bring fairness and timely resolution to the claims process. 

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750021">Our Government recently concluded a final settlement on Indian Residential Schools and will launch a commission for truth and reconciliation. The Prime Minister, on behalf of our Government, will use this occasion to make a statement of apology to close this sad chapter in our history.

            <B>Providing Effective Economic Leadership for a Prosperous Future</B>
          </ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750023">This is a time of economic uncertainty and volatility in the wider world. While the economic fundamentals of our country are strong, Canada is not immune from this turbulence. Canadians understand these challenges and want a government that is a competent and effective manager of the economy.</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750024"> 

With Advantage Canada, our Government has laid out a sensible economic plan to secure better-paying jobs and solid growth for Canadians. The Minister of Finance will soon provide a Fall Economic and Fiscal Update, which will outline the next steps in that plan to ensure that Canada has a modern infrastructure, an innovative and entrepreneurial business environment, and a tax system that rewards hard work—all based on a foundation of sound fiscal management.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750025">As part of ensuring economic security for Canadians, our Government will bring forward a long-term plan of broad-based tax relief for individuals, businesses and families—including following through on its commitment to a further cut to the GST. To complement this, our Government will support Canadian researchers and innovators in developing new ideas and bringing them to the marketplace through Canada’s Science and Technology Strategy. Our Government will improve the protection of cultural and intellectual property rights in Canada, including copyright reform. Our Government will also take measures to improve the governance and management of the Employment Insurance Account. 

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750026">The bedrock of our workforce is middle-class Canadians and their families. These families worry about the rising costs of higher education and the expense of caring for elderly parents. They worry about affordable housing and the number of homeless people on our streets. Our Government is committed to helping Canadian families meet their needs. The Working Income Tax Benefit will help Canadians get back into the workforce, and the registered disability savings plan will help families care for children with severe disabilities. Our Government will continue to invest in our families and our future, and will help those seeking to break free from the cycles of homelessness and poverty. 

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750027">Our Government will announce an infrastructure program, the Building Canada Plan, to support our long-term growth. By investing in our transport and trade hubs, including the Windsor–Detroit corridor and the Atlantic and Pacific gateways, our Government will help rebuild our fundamentals for continued growth. 

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750028">The result will be safer roads and bridges, shorter commutes, more competitive business, improved cultural infrastructure and a better quality of life for all Canadians.</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750029">

Our Government will stand up for Canada’s traditional industries. Key sectors including forestry, fisheries, manufacturing and tourism are facing challenges. Our Government has taken action to support workers as these industries adjust to global conditions and will continue to do so in the next session.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750030">The agricultural sector will benefit from our Government’s promotion of biofuels and the new Growing Forward agricultural framework. Our Government will recognize the views of farmers, as expressed in the recent plebiscite on barley, by enacting marketing choice. Together with our Government’s strong support for Canada’s supply-managed system, these approaches will deliver stable, predictable and bankable support for farm families. 

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750031">Our mining and resource sectors present extraordinary opportunities across Canada, and our Government will help move forward by providing a single window for major project approvals. With these increased opportunities for employment, our Government will continue to foster partnerships that help Aboriginal people get the skills and training to take advantage of these job prospects in the North and across Canada.

            <B>Tackling Crime and Strengthening the Security of Canadians</B>
          </ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750033">Canada was founded on the principles of peace, order and good government. This is the birthright of all Canadians; yet Canadians feel less safe today and rightly worry about the security of their neighbourhoods and the country. There is no greater responsibility for a government than to protect this right to safety and security.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750034">In the last session, our Government introduced important and timely legislation to tackle violent crime. Unfortunately much of this legislation did not pass. That is not good enough to maintain the confidence of Canadians. Our Government will immediately reintroduce these measures with a single, comprehensive Tackling Violent Crime bill to protect Canadians and their communities from violent criminals and predators. This will include measures on the age of protection, impaired driving, dangerous offenders and stricter bail and mandatory prison sentences for those who commit gun crimes. Canadians expect prompt passage of this crucial legislation.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750035">Our Government will go further with a Safer Communities strategy to deal with the critical intersection of drug, youth and property crime. Our Government will strengthen the Youth Criminal Justice Act to ensure that young offenders who commit serious crimes are held accountable to victims and their communities. Our Government will introduce tough new laws to tackle property crime, including the serious problem of auto theft. New measures to address elder abuse and to curb identity theft will also be introduced. Our Government will implement the National Anti-Drug Strategy giving law enforcement agencies powers to take on those who produce and push drugs on our streets. 

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750036">In addition to tougher laws, our Government will provide targeted support to communities and victims. It will help families and local communities in steering vulnerable youth away from a life of drugs and crime, and the Anti-Drug Strategy will help to treat those suffering from drug addiction. It will again ask Parliament to repeal the wasteful long-gun registry. Our Government will also ensure effective law enforcement—starting with resources to recruit 2,500 more officers to police our streets. 

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750037">The concern of Canadians in protecting our communities extends naturally to protecting our country against threats to our national security: those who would attack the peaceful pluralism of our society through acts of terrorism. Canada has experienced the tragedy of terrorism before. The report from the public inquiry into the Air India bombing will be an important contribution to safeguarding the lives of Canadians in the future. 

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750038">Our Government will address Canadians directly on the challenge of protecting our free and open society with a statement on national security. The Government will introduce legislation to make sure that Canada has the tools it needs to stop those who would threaten our cities, communities and families, including measures to strengthen the Anti-Terrorism Act and to respond to the Supreme Court decision on security certificates.

            <B>Improving the Environment and Health of Canadians</B>
          </ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750040">Threats to our environment are a clear and present danger that now confronts governments around the world. This is nowhere more evident than in the growing challenge of climate change.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750041">Our Government believes that action is needed now to ensure our quality of life, particularly for those most vulnerable to health threats from the environment—our children and seniors. 

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750042">Climate change is a global issue and requires a global solution. Our Government believes strongly that an effective global approach to greenhouse gas emissions must have binding targets that apply to all major emitters, including Canada. Canada has already engaged the international community at APEC, the G8 and the United Nations and will continue to press for a new international agreement that cuts global emissions in half by 2050. 

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750043">As we pursue a global consensus, Canada is acting even more aggressively at home. Our Government will implement our national strategy to reduce Canada’s total greenhouse gas emissions 60 to 70 percent by 2050. There will be a 20 percent reduction by 2020. Our Government will bring forward the elements from Canada’s Clean Air Act, which had all-party consensus, for parliamentary consideration.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750044">This strategy will institute binding national regulations on greenhouse gas emissions across all major industrial sectors—with requirements for emissions reductions starting this year. Our Government will also bring forward the first ever national air pollution regulations. In so doing, our Government will put Canada at the forefront of clean technologies to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Our Government will also establish a carbon emissions trading market that will give business the incentive to run cleaner, greener operations.</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750045">

At the end of 2005, Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions were 33 percent above the Kyoto commitment. It is now widely understood that, because of inaction on greenhouse gases over the last decade, Canada’s emissions cannot be brought to the level required under the Kyoto Protocol within the compliance period, which begins on January 1, 2008, just 77 days from now. 

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750046">The world is moving on to address climate change and the environment, and Canada intends to help lead the effort at home and abroad.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750047">Beyond regulating greenhouse gases and air pollution, our Government has also acted to protect sensitive areas, including a massive expansion of Nahanni National Park, and preserving the Great Bear Rainforest, Point Pleasant Park and Stanley Park. Through our new infrastructure plan, our Government will promote a cleaner environment by investing in public transport and water treatment, and by cleaning up contaminated sites. A new water strategy will be implemented to help clean up our major lakes and oceans and to improve access to safe drinking water for First Nations. 

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750048">In the past, environmental legislation and regulation have had little impact because they have lacked an effective enforcement regime. In the coming session, our Government will bolster the protection of our water and land through tougher environmental enforcement that will make polluters accountable.

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750049">Environmental protection is not just about protecting nature. It is about the health of Canadians. Recent events have called into question the safety of basic products such as food for our families and toys for our children. 

</ParaText>
          <ParaText id="750050">Our Government shares the concern of parents about the safety of consumer products and food. Canadians should expect the same standards of quality from imported goods as they do from products made at home.

              <ParaText id="750071">Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by thanking Her Excellency the Governor General for graciously reading the Speech from the Throne. Her delivery once again was superb.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750072">On a personal note, I would like to thank my family: my wife, Sandra, and our three children, Fabian Jr., Mark, and Heather. Their continued love and support during almost 15 years of political life is a never-ending source of strength for me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750073">I would also like to thank my constituents in the riding of Avalon, in the wonderful province of Newfoundland and Labrador, for giving me their confidence and trust. It is my great honour and privilege to represent them in this honourable House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750074">Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> for having asked me to move the government's motion in support of the Speech from the Throne.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750075"> It is a visionary document that sets out our agenda not just for the upcoming session of Parliament but for the long term future of Canada. Our agenda is focused on building a stronger, safer, better Canada that works for all of us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750076">In the first session of Parliament, we delivered on the following commitments, which we made to Canadians in the last federal election. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750077">We passed the <Document DbId="2158135" Type="3">Federal Accountability Act</Document>, the toughest anti-corruption legislation in Canadian history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750078"> We cut taxes right across the board, including the GST. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750079">We started cracking down on gun, gang and drug crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750080"> We provided direct benefits to families with the universal child care benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750081"> We worked with the provinces and territories to develop patient wait time guarantees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750082"> We took concrete action to protect and improve the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750083"> We restored fiscal balance by increasing equalization payments and funding the large social transfers on an equal per capita cash basis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750084">We revived Canada's traditional leadership role on the international stage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750085">I think members would agree that this is an impressive list of accomplishments for a minority government, but as today's Speech from the Throne demonstrates, we have only just begin to build a better, safer Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750086">Our government will focus on five core priorities in the upcoming session of Parliament. These priorities will build on the successes we have achieved so far.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750087">First, our government will continue to strengthen Canada's sovereignty and security. Gone are the days of neglecting the Canadian Forces. Gone are the days of ignoring challenges to our sovereignty and of pursuing a weak and indecisive foreign policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750088">I have had the privilege of talking to many of our men and women in uniform, especially those from my native Newfoundland and Labrador. I have heard them relate their experiences of how they are indeed making a positive difference throughout the world in places less fortunate than Canada, such as Afghanistan. They are assured of our government's continued support for their efforts to make our world a safer place, for ours is a government that takes these responsibilities seriously. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750089">That is why we will do more to assert and defend our sovereignty in the Arctic, and to ensure that Canada's foreign policy defends our interests and projects the values we hold dear: democracy, freedom, human rights, and the rule of law.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="10">(2010)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="750090">Second, our government will continue to strengthen our federation. Canada, I am pleased to report, is more united today than it has been in four decades, but we need to do more to undo the damage done to federalism by our predecessors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750091">Our government will work to place formal limits on the use of federal spending for new shared cost programs in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. We will also push ahead with democratizing the Senate by reintroducing legislation that would lower Senate terms from 45 years to 8 years. We will give Canadians a voice in selecting their representatives in the upper chamber.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750092">Third, our government will continue to provide effective economic leadership. Building upon our tax cutting success from the first session, we will bring forward a long term plan of further broad-based tax relief for individuals, businesses and families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750093">We will also continue supporting Canadian workers in troubled sectors like manufacturing, forestry, agriculture, tourism and fisheries as their industries adjust to evolving international economic conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750094">Fourth, we will continue tackling an issue rankling Canadians from coast to coast to coast: crime. In addition to reintroducing our anti-violent crime measures that were blocked by the opposition in the last session, our government will undertake new initiatives aimed at cracking down on young offenders and property crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750095">We will also take action to ensure Canadians are protected from terrorism, the bane of democratic free societies in our modern age. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750096">As the Governor General rightly noted, peace, order and good government are the principles upon which Canada was founded. Our government is going to work hard to ensure that they prevail over those who would wreak havoc in our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750097">Last, but certainly not least, we will continue protecting and improving Canada's most important natural resource, our environment. Canadians have made it clear. They are fed up with lofty words masking inaction. They want policies that make real measurable improvements to the environment. Our government has heard this call and we are acting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750098">In addition to taking a leading role in the global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, our government will bring forward the first ever national air pollution regulations. We will strengthen enforcement to punish those who pollute our water and land. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750099">Our government is intent on building a better Canada through strong leadership. In the weeks and months ahead we are going to continue delivering on the issues that matter most to ordinary Canadians. We urge the opposition parties to support our efforts. Of course, as we are all aware, it is their prerogative not to, but they should consider their choice very carefully. Canadians do not want an election. They want us to govern this country. They want strong leadership and a better, safer Canada.</ParaText>

There are issues around the lack of sectoral strategies. The previous Liberal administration promised an auto policy but it did not deliver. In fact, one of its members, the minister of industry at that time, flip-flopped and crossed the floor to the Conservatives in order to pursue an aggressive strategy to sign a deal with Korea that will cost the manufacturers and auto jobs in Ontario.</ParaText>

Why are the Conservatives continuing to move toward trade deals that would cost Canadians their jobs?</ParaText>

We will continue to work with Canadians to ensure jobs are created throughout Canada from coast to coast to coast.

              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="750131">I would like to thank my wife Audrey and each of my children, my four daughters and my son, for all their support in my work as an MP. I also thank the good people of Glengarry--Prescott--Russell for the confidence they have placed in me. It is an honour to represent them here in the House and in government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="750133">The first speech I made in the House was to move the motion for our government's maiden throne speech which was aptly titled “Turning a New Leaf”. When Canadians went to the polls in January, almost two years ago, they did so with a singular purpose: to demand change. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750134">Disgusted with all the scandals, fed up with wasteful spending and weak leadership and demoralized by Canada's diminished role on the international stage, men and women from across our great country stood up and said enough. They demanded clean, accountable government, lower taxes, new laws cracking down on crime, choice in child care, better access to health care and strong decisive leadership at home and abroad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750135">In the last session of Parliament we delivered real results on all of those fronts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750136">Last spring we delivered a budget that restored fiscal balance and once again we kept spending focused on results and reduced taxes for working Canadians and their families. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750137">Among the accomplishments of our Conservative budget: the marriage penalty, out of the tax system; income splitting for seniors, a truly great initiative; the lifetime capital gains exemption for farmers and small business owners, up; and taxes for families with children, down. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750138">Tax freedom day is the day that Canadians stop working to pay taxes and start working for themselves and their families. Because of our budgets, tax freedom day arrived four days earlier this year and it will be earlier again next year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750139">Recently our government released an update on the health of the Canadian economy. The good news contained in its pages far outstripped our expectations. Indeed, thanks to our government's sound fiscal management, we were able to announce one of the largest debt reductions in history: $14.2 billion and that is on top of the $13.2 billion we paid down last year. Less debt means less interest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750140">Whereas the Liberals think these savings belong in government coffers, Conservatives believe they belong in the pockets of hard-working Canadian taxpayers. Thanks to our government's tax back guarantee, that is exactly where they will go, $725 million in fact in the form of personal income tax cuts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750141">It may be a minority Parliament where the Liberals, NDP and Bloc hold most of the seats, but this Parliament's accomplishments have been thoroughly Conservative: a lower GST; tax relief for commuters, students, trades people, seniors; kids' sports; tax relief for parents with children; a child care plan that focuses money on families directly instead of on a day care bureaucracy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750142"> A national plan to preserve ecologically sensitive lands, a regulatory regime which, for the first time, reduces air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions are Conservative accomplishments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750143">Fixed dates for federal elections, tougher laws against crime and more support for victims are Conservative accomplishments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750144">More support for veterans, boosting the military to better defend our country at home and protect our interests abroad and refocusing Canada's foreign policy to promote freedom, democracy and human rights are Conservative accomplishments.

I joined the military at the age of 17 and was honoured to serve our great country in uniform for 20 years. The dedication, professionalism and courage of our men and women of the Canadian Forces is a source of great pride for Canadians across the country.

              <ParaText id="750176">Mr. Speaker, it is fair to say that our government is interested in all Canadians, including those who find themselves in situations of poverty. Within the throne speech are initiatives outlining that we will be working for Canadians who find themselves in poverty, particularly on aboriginal reserves. We spoke about improving housing and providing affordable housing. We spoke about providing tax cuts for Canadians from which everyone will benefit.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="750178">I was very encouraged that the Speech from the Throne brought attention to very specific justice measures once again, bills that were passed democratically by the House but unfortunately were held up in the unelected red chamber.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750179">Does the hon. member think the Senate has any moral or democratic grounds whatsoever to hold up those justice measures that were democratically passed by the House? I would like to know if the member has any advice regarding the red chamber.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="750180">Mr. Speaker, what Canadians saw in the first session of this Parliament was obstruction both in the House and in the Senate with the delaying of bills. Bills that passed in the House moved to the Liberal dominated Senate, but under the leadership of the <Affiliation DbId="105458" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> they stagnated, much to the shame of that party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="750181">Canadians have asked for change. They want a government that is going to get tough on crime, get tough with criminals. We are tabling legislation to do so, and the Senate and the House of Commons have a responsibility to pass those bills.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="750184">Rather than flowery talk about very general ideas and concepts that he has in his mind, I ask the member to deal with this one specific issue. Will he, as a member of Parliament, live up to the commitment that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, his leader, made and honour the commitment to veterans and their spouses? I want a very simple answer, yes or no. The devil is in the details. The hon. member has an obligation to stand up for all veterans and their spouses, and for Joyce Carter. Will he or will he not do it?</ParaText>
