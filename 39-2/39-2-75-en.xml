              <ParaText id="1010969">The reason there are no police in Gameti, Colville Lake, Wrigley or Sachs Harbour is that Ottawa does not provide fair funding based on the real cost of government programs and services in the north.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1010970">The Conservatives are continuing this tradition. In the NWT, the so-called police officers recruitment fund covers about 75% of the cost of one constable, three-quarters of a crime fighter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1010971">The NWT's solicitor general says, “We're actually kind of disappointed at the allocation because it's based on a per capita, with just a small top-up to the territories”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1010972">It should have been clear that more funding is needed after two officers were killed in the north. Just like the Liberals, the Conservatives talk a great line on the north but they will not walk the walk.</ParaText>

the number of sites owned and/or operated under cost-shared agreements with provinces and territories is 600,  nearly 300 of which are in the Great Lakes. 
</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011265"> In response to (b), the key purpose is to determine water quality status and trends and assess overall aquatic ecosystem health. Some monitoring or surveillance is also undertaken to better understand presence and levels of emerging contaminants and threats such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers, PBDEs, used in flame retardants, pesticides, and other persistent organic pollutants. The data and generated information is used in many different reporting activities including the Water Quality Index under the Canadian Environmental Sustainability Indicators, CESI, annual report
(http://www.environmentandresources.ca/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=6F66F932-1).
</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011266">Some of the key obligations and legislative responsibilities that Environment Canada's monitoring activities fall under include: Canadian Environmental Protection Act, CEPA,  ministerial statutory obligation to monitor and report on environmental quality to Canadians; Boundary Waters Treaty Act,  obligations to the International Joint Commission and the parties; and  Canada Water Act, provides for federal-provincial and federal-territorial agreements to monitoring and assess waters of shared interest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011267"> In response to (c), the government monitors the quality of surface water through (a), Environment Canada monitoring and surveillance sites; (b) formal cost and capacity sharing agreements with provinces and territories; and 
(c) collaborative monitoring and surveillance programs among federal science and technology departments and university researchers. 
</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011268">Sampling of water bodies is done on a regular or ad hoc basis several times a year for a wide range of physical parameters, chemical contaminants and biological measures, e.g., temperature, dissolved oxygen, nutrients, trace metals, pesticides, presence and diversity of aquatic biota. Sampling locations take into account the diverse contaminant sources and water quality threats such as urban wastewaters, industrial effluents, agricultural runoff and atmospheric deposits. In addition to physical-chemical monitoring, we have started to establish a network of biological monitoring that will allow assessing impacts and effects of contaminants on aquatic ecosystems health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011269"> In response to (d), the current program provides an adequate picture for basic water quality measures and contaminants in areas of the country where spatial and temporal coverage has been established for some time, e.g., large basins such as the Great Lakes. However, in most basins or watersheds across Canada, the government’s understanding of the types and levels of contaminants in surface waters varies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011270">Nationally, we monitor about a third of total sub-basins under the routine monitoring programs, which mainly address metals and nutrients. Surveillance projects focusing on toxic organic contaminants--pesticides--PCBs, polychlorinated biphenyls, PBDEs, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and other CEPA toxics are more spatially restricted to watersheds potentially threatened.

            <ResponseContent>
              <ParaText id="1011272">Mr. Speaker, Environment Canada’s Canadian Wildlife Service indicated that the available data showed no colonies of migratory birds  in the vicinity of the project area. A colony can be defined as a group of birds that nest in a gregarious manner, have been returning to the same area for several years and build their nests close together. Several species of seabirds and herons, for instance, live in colonies. It also indicated that it found no species considered at risk under the Species at Risk Act, or wetlands.  Wetlands are defined as land that is saturated in water long enough to be conducive to the wetland or aquatic processes characterized by poorly drained soil, hydrophilic vegetation and various forms of biological activity that are suited to a damp environment. Wetlands include bogs, marshes, swamps and shallow water, usually two metres or less, as defined in The Canadian Wetland Classification System, published by the Canadian Committee on Ecological Land Classification’s National Wetlands Working Group, 1987.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011273">The data used by Environment Canada in providing this reply are the same as are used for any environmental impact assessment, i.e., one, data gathered by its employees during inventories, two, databases developed by Environment Canada or in partnership with other government agencies and non government organizations, and three, databases provided by other organizations that use volunteers and amateur ornithologists and that are supported financially by Environment Canada. Environment Canada is confident that these data sources provide reliable information for this environmental assessment. </ParaText>

Currently, the data management system contains more than 10,500 occurrences of various elements related mainly to threatened or vulnerable species, namely 375 vascular plants and 79 vertebrate animals. In the near future, certain groups of invertebrates, i.e., molluscs and insects, natural communities and animal assemblages will be added to the elements of biodiversity already being tracked. This information is updated annually. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011276">The Étude des populations d’oiseaux du Québec, population studies of Quebec’s birds, database: The population studies of Quebec’s birds database contains an electronic version of recorded daily bird sightings in Quebec. For more than 50 years, several Quebec ornithologists have systematically recorded their daily observations on these records. To date, there is a bank of more than 450,000 records of daily bird watching outings, containing more than 6,300,000 sightings. This information is updated annually. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011277">Endangered birds in Quebec: The work performed by the Ministère des Ressources naturelles et de la Faune du Québec, Quebec department of natural resources and wildlife, and the Canadian Wildlife Service’s Regroupement Québec Oiseaux has resulted in a new list of species deemed to be at risk in Quebec. This project also includes a database, SOS-POP, on the location of the various species. This information is updated annually. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011278">Black Duck Joint Venture: This program provides data for tracking changes in the number of nesting black ducks using an annual inventory in the species’ primary nesting area. Although it was developed to optimize the counting of black ducks, this aerial inventory also provides trends regarding numbers and estimates of populations of other wildlife species nesting in the boreal forest. This information was updated in 2005 in the sector in question. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011279">Conservation Atlas of Wetlands in the St. Lawrence Valley: The primary objective of the atlas is to provide an overview of wetlands in the St. Lawrence Valley using innovative methods for mapping the area in order to promote the conservation of birds and biodiversity, particularly by helping managers in their decision making regarding the use of land and the conservation of natural environments. This information was last updated five years ago. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011280">The aquatic birds of the St. Lawrence: This information base provides an overview of the distribution, status and trends of the populations of seabirds and certain colonial aquatic birds nesting in Quebec. It must be noted, however, that the information available is much more comprehensive for seabirds in the St. Lawrence estuary and the Gulf. This information is about three years old for the sector in question. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011281">Biodiversity Portrait of the St. Lawrence: The portrait provides land planners with detailed information regarding the habitats and biota of sites requiring urgent or priority conservation, restoration or protection.

            <ResponseContent>
              <ParaText id="1011283">Mr. Speaker, in response to  (a), Canada is a party to the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, FCTC, which came into force on February 27, 2005.  Article 11, packaging and labelling of tobacco products, of the FCTC requires each party to the convention, within three years after coming into force, for that party to adopt and implement, in accordance with its national law, effective measures to ensure that each tobacco package carry health warnings describing the harmful effects of tobacco use.  Article 11 further states that the health warnings ”should be 50% or more of the principal display areas but shall be no less than 30%”.  For Canada, the three year implementation period ended on February 27, 2008.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011284">In 2000, Canada enacted its tobacco products information regulations which meet or exceed the requirements of Article 11 of the FCTC for the most part, as more than 95% of the Canadian market is currently in full compliance with the convention obligations.  However, the tobacco products not presently covered by the tobacco products information regulations include individually wrapped cigars and niche market products, such as water pipe tobacco.  In addition, the health warnings for cigars in a box and pipe tobacco contained in a pouch being of fixed dimensions may not meet the Convention’s requirement to occupy no less than 30% of the principal display areas in certain circumstances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011285">As a result, the Government of Canada, in anticipation of the need to revise and expand its tobacco products information regulations, began holding public consultations in 2004 with a view to strengthening the regulatory framework.  A large amount of labelling concepts, contents and layout, has been tested.  As part of the ongoing regulatory change process, in 2007 08, stakeholder meetings have been taking place.  Finally, work on the cost benefit analysis is expected to start in the summer of 2008.  The government is ensuring that the regulatory process is followed to produce comprehensive regulations that will comply with Article 11 of FCTC and be of benefit to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011286">In response to (b), it is expected that new labelling requirements addressing the remaining tobacco products and bringing Canada into full compliance with Article 11 of the FCTC will be in place in October 2010.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1011301">Mr. Speaker, I have a point of order I wish to make in relation to a private member's bill currently before the House in which it appears could be debated tomorrow. It is Bill <Document DbId="3075670" Type="4">C-505</Document>. My point of order concerns the constitutionality of the bill. Either the bill is totally unconstitutional or it is in the wrong form, and I will point out where I am coming from on that in my remarks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011302">It is my view that the bill should either not be debated and/or should be ordered discharged and dropped from the order paper for these reasons. I will read clause 2 of the bill. It says:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1011307">I want to point out, Mr. Speaker, as you know and most members know, private members' business in the House does not receive the scrutiny or check of the Department of Justice that all government bills must do under the Department of Justice Act. Since private members' business is not subject to Department of Justice scrutiny, it is entirely possible that some of the business that does come through might be constitutionally offside. In this case I believe it certainly is offside.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011308">I want to read as well subsection 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. We are dealing with constitutional law here and this is bedrock law. </ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of Canada, and any law that is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution is, to the extent of the inconsistency, of no force or effect.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="1011310">I want to submit also that the federal government's multiculturalism policy and section 27 of the charter, which I just read, are now in law and in practice, flip sides of the same constitutional coin. In fact, the Canadian Multiculturalism Act recites the Canadian constitutional provision, section 27, right in the preamble, they are that connected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011311">In the House, by section 9 of the same Multiculturalism Act, the House is charged with permanently reviewing the operation of the act and that policy. The constitution is explicitly the foundation for that statute and the statute is the explicit manifestation of that constitutional provision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011312">A very real example of the constitutional application of multicultural policy beyond the framework of the statute itself is found in the ruling of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Keegstra, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 697, wherein the Criminal Code hate crimes are ruled by the court to be a function of the application of section 27 of the charter, that is the multiculturalism section of the charter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011313">We have the Criminal Code application in Canada, that particular provision, being justified and being related to that provision of our constitution. The bill with which we are dealing purports to say that the multiculturalism policy does not apply in the province of Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011314">I submit that clause 2 of the bill, which I read, is so inconsistent with section 27 of the constitutional charter that it cannot be sustained. It is unconstitutional and should not be considered for further debate or process. Either clause 2 of the bill should be struck or the entire bill should be struck.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011315">A second possible response to the member's legislative initiative is that the bill is really a constitutional amendment providing for some kind of provincial exemption from the constitution. It is possible that is what the member has intended and he has submitted a bill to do that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1011316">Members can propose amendments to our Constitution, but in this case a bill is not the proper form. Constitutional amendments are, by section 38 of the Constitution, accomplished by way of a resolution of both Houses, et cetera, not by a bill. Resolutions are described in Marleau and Montpetit, at page 794, footnote 184, if the Speaker needs a reference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011317">My conclusion is that Bill <Document DbId="3075670" Type="4">C-505</Document>, using the words I quoted, “purports to obstruct, to displace, or to undermine” section 27 of our charter based in the Constitution and must utterly fail, for those reasons, both in law and as to form. Either the bill or clause 2 on its own should be struck and an order discharging the House from further consideration should be made.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1011326"> In the old days it was done by resolution because it was only the British House of Commons that could amend the Constitution. However, since the repatriation of the Constitution, this can be amended now by the Parliament of Canada in certain circumstances. I am afraid I am unfamiliar with the procedure for that, but I will check into it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1011332">Mr. Speaker, I had best get going if I have only two minutes. What we are debating is the amendment from the New Democratic Party to separate out the immigration provisions of this legislation because there are very serious changes to Canada's immigration law. We do not believe they should be buried in a budget implementation bill and we do not believe they can best be scrutinized there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011333">The Conservatives are right in that there is a problem with the backlog. The Liberals did not address the problem with the backlog and in fact created the backlog over many years in office. They stimulated it by not providing the appropriate funding to the department to do the processing and by not providing appropriate immigration targets for the country despite the fact that year after year they promised to increase that target. At one point, I added up all the years in which they missed their proposed target for immigration. If we added them all up, it probably would have eliminated the backlog on hand at that time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011334">Yes, there were problems. However, what the Conservatives are proposing is not going to fix the problems. In fact, it is only going to make them worse. The kind of discretion that the Conservatives propose to give the minister is just plain wrong. We need clarity in our immigration proposals. This is wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011335">In their immigration policy, the Conservatives are also giving far too great an emphasis to temporary foreign workers. We know that these workers are too easily exploited. They provide cheap labour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011336"> Fortunately, we in Canada have never relied on this kind of labour to drive our economy. Unlike European countries that have had strong guest worker policies, we have never gone that route. We prefer instead to bring people in because of economic need as permanent residents and put them on the track to becoming full citizens of Canada. Unfortunately, the Conservatives are reversing that policy as well. It is one of the serious problems with their immigration policy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1011337">Mr. Speaker, I am wondering about the NDP's position on this, quite frankly, and I am hoping that perhaps their members will address this, because this is not an immigration bill. There is no such thing on the table. This is a budget bill. If they want to address the budget, I would dearly love to support them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011338"> However, I have some difficulties with their position on immigration because of what happened when there was an immigration plan on the table. There was $1.4 billion for integration and settlement. There was $700 million for fixing the system by accelerating processing and eliminating the backlog over a five year period. There was $88 million established for foreign credentials recognition. There was $10 million for expanding a student visa program to encourage more students to come into the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011339">The NDP members voted against that and precipitated an election as a result. Today they are objecting to a plan they say is there, but I have not seen one. Would they please elaborate for the members on this side, who would like to support them, what specifics of a plan they are objecting to might actually emerge from a bill that is not in the House?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1011341"> The fact is that this legislation, which is buried in a budget bill, would fundamentally change the powers of the <Affiliation DbId="105834" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship and Immigration</Affiliation>, so much so that we could in fact drive a Mack truck right through the immigration act and the immigration provisions. They are very significant proposals. They should not be buried in a budget bill. They should stand on their own. They should be debated on their own. They should go to the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration, whose members have the particular expertise and experience to deal with those kinds of recommendations, not to the finance committee, whose members' expertise lies in other areas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011342">What would we do instead? We would make sure there is transparency. We would make sure that we meet a target of 1% of population for immigration every year. We would make sure that we preserve the track from permanent residence to full citizenship in Canada. We would make sure that temporary foreign workers do not become guest workers and get exploited in Canada. We would make sure that family reunification, the most successful piece of our immigration program, retains a central place in our immigration program.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1011343">Mr. Speaker, I hear the member talking about the backlog as if it is some kind of disease. I suggest to him that the backlog of 800,000 people is actually a huge asset in regard to immigrants wanting and waiting to come here. It is a two and a half year wait if we look at the average wait time for those 800,000 people. We take more immigrants per capita than any other country in the world. I am not so sure the member should be calling it a backlog. If we had no backlog, would the member not agree that we would be pulling our hair out and saying that our immigration program is an absolute failure?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011344">Why do the member and his party not simply focus on the committee process? We cannot materially alter this bill here. We can defeat it in the House, but this is a budget implementation bill containing dozens and dozens of provisions and all kinds of financial provisions. We should try to fix this bill at the committee where the clause in question can actually be excised and not adopted. Is that not a better solution than the NDP proposal in this case?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1011345">Mr. Speaker, the backlog is actually 900,000 people. I would ask the member to talk to people in his constituency who are waiting for a relative stuck in that backlog and ask them if they do not think it is a problem. It is a huge problem for families looking to be reunited in Canada to have to wait year after year to be reunited with that relative, especially when they were promised when they emigrated to Canada that their family members would be able to join them. We broke a promise to immigrants who came to Canada when we told them that our immigration policy was such that their family would be reunified in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011346">There are two possibilities. If we did not have a backlog, it could mean that we were in desperate need of immigrants, but it might also mean that the processing in our immigration program was working appropriately and that people were not having to wait unacceptable lengths of time to have their applications processed and to join their family members in Canada. It would mean that employers would not have to wait for employees that they need to do important work in Canada.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1011348">Mr. Speaker, obviously I plan to talk about the whole issue of the amendment, but I will also take this opportunity to speak on Bill <Document DbId="3354384" Type="3">C-50</Document>, the budget implementation bill, and share some more general but, I believe, nonetheless very important thoughts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011349">Coming on the heels of a budget that is timid, to say the least, Bill <Document DbId="3354384" Type="3">C-50, Budget Implementation Act, 2008</Document>, confirms this government's vision and essentially incorporates a bill on immigration that is totally unacceptable in terms of both its content and the way it is being introduced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011350">On reading budget 2008, I felt that seniors and the poor were the big losers. I voted against this budget largely for this reason. Now, by adding immigration clauses, the government has done something totally unacceptable, in my opinion. These clauses give the minister absolutely extraordinary discretionary powers. There will be other big losers if we accept this. If this goes through, all newcomers to Canada, especially people who want to sponsor family members, will have a hard time living with the new reality of arbitrary decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011351">I want to talk about more general issues, as I said previously. In this Budget Implementation Act, 2008, regional economies—an issue I feel strongly about and one that will always be close to my heart—and environmental concerns are really given short shrift. The measures in the bill are too timid to give clear, targeted help to the thousands of people across Canada with urgent, pressing needs. It is shameful that, once again, the government has not chosen to act for the common good and redistribute wealth when it can.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011352">The government has chosen to use $10 billion to pay down the debt instead of looking after the people for whom it is responsible and redistributing wealth. Because it has decided to pay down the debt, the government is using smoke and mirrors and more often than not presenting us with budget measures spread over two years—measures it is not giving much attention to. Sometimes, the figures look quite promising, but when they are cut in half, they are much less attractive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011353">Very few people are fooled by this scheme. As I said last fall in criticizing the economic statement, it is precisely because, quite frankly, there was not much to it and nothing substantial for seniors and businesses in our region that I obviously decided to vote against the statement, as I did against this budget and as I will continue to do against this budget implementation bill, which I find unacceptable. It is only logical.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011354">Today, the government is implementing some of the claims regarding provincial jurisdictions. We had questions about the elimination of the millennium scholarship and the creation of an independent employment insurance commission. All these steps taken by the government are baby steps and their significance should not be exaggerated, as it is quite limited. The people in our regions want to see real, detailed changes, which they do not often see from this government.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="45">(1545)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1011355">The people who need help from this government, people in my riding and throughout Quebec, are truly being left out in the cold by this budget and this budget implementation bill. I am talking about seniors and forestry workers in particular.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011356">As far as seniors are concerned, this government recently had the opportunity, as many in this House will recall, to take a look at our least fortunate seniors and study the entire issue through the motion I presented, which, I am happy to report, was adopted by a majority vote. The only members who voted against the motion were the Conservative members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011357">The government thus had an opportunity to address the issue, to do things differently, to try to eliminate poverty among our seniors, those who built our regions, our country, our nation of Quebec and the rest of Canada. It had an opportunity to lift these people above the poverty line.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011358">My motion did not ask for much. In it I asked that our seniors be lifted above the poverty line and be allowed to work 15 hours a week at the minimum wage established by their province of residence without being penalized with respect to the guaranteed income supplement. It was not much, but it was well-meaning. We know what this government decided to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011359">The Conservatives have taken some measures. No one can be against the good things or against virtue. They announced $13 million to fight violence against seniors; that in itself is important. Furthermore, they announced the creation of a TFSA, that special account. This is good, if the seniors have any money. My main focus was help for poor seniors. If seniors can save a maximum of $5,000 per year in a special savings account, good for them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011360">But before helping those who have resources and pensions, the government's responsibility and obligation is to take care of the people who need it most. In this case, I will continue to hammer home my demands, the demands of the people, of seniors and of those who fight for seniors' rights and needs, because they need more than what the government offered in its budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011361">I will not have a chance to discuss all the sectors of the Quebec economy, but there is one in particular that affects everyone, at least on this side of the House: the manufacturing and forestry sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011362">It is completely unacceptable that despite the creation of a special fund intended to help these regions and sectors where many manufacturing and forestry companies are experiencing a crisis, there are still huge job losses. The government had the opportunity to help these foresters and to give them a boost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011363">In my region and in Quebec in particular, I am thinking about private woodlots and the foresters who own them, who cultivate our forests, who look after them competently, successfully taking environmental concerns into consideration. The Conservative government completely forgot about them. It completely ignored the reality in the forestry sector, and particularly the private forestry sector, in Quebec and elsewhere. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011364">For all the reasons I mentioned—and I am sorry I must stop, because I could have talked for 20 minutes—it is clear that I cannot support this budget implementation bill, and will vote against it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1011395">My riding is one of the very needy ridings in Ontario. According to the package of indicators, it is second in terms of the kinds of supports that are necessary. We have a large number of new immigrants and a large number of them are not working because they cannot meet the certification that is required.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011396">The member talked about Jennifer McPhee. I think Jennifer is one of those among the working poor who are searching for dignity in life. However, she has dignity because the member has taken up her cause.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011397"> I did not hear the member actually speak to the immigration act, the portion of this omnibus bill with which we are trying to come to grips. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011398">Could the member indicate what she would like to see with respect to those supports that new immigrants require? We talk about settlement services and so on. Could she just give us a quick overview on how deficient the bill is and why, in those particular areas, we should seek out resolutions because of the kinds of circumstances that she and I and many members are facing in their ridings, and that the government's approach is not coming to grips with those needs?</ParaText>

Immigration should be in a separate bill that would be debated in committee but, unfortunately, that will not happen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011401">The inclusion of immigration within the budget implementation bill would give the minister sweeping powers to have the final say and have the discretion over all immigrants, which will not help the process.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1011410">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the budget implementation act and, along with my colleagues, I intend to vote against this bill. It is very problematic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011411">The budget and the budget implementation act would basically strip away the government's fiscal capacity and place a rising burden on individual taxpayers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011412">We have seen corporate tax giveaways rising while the individual burden proportionately is increasing through this budget and it is destroying any semblance of balance between the taxes paid by large corporations, many of which are very profitable, and the taxes paid by ordinary Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011413">We know that the kinds of across-the-board tax cuts that the government is bringing in continues the pattern, unfortunately, of previous governments, which is of giving back moneys to the most profitable companies. Who has been making the big profits in this country? Certainly the banks have been digging in with both hands and have been extremely profitable. The oil and gas companies have seen their profits skyrocket with the rising price of oil. They are doing extremely well and these corporate cuts just fuel their profits and support. It subsidizes a sector that, quite frankly, should not be getting subsidies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011414">What is the impact here? The impact is that the proportion of tax revenue coming from large corporations will go down by 12% but the percentage paid by individual Canadians, the average person who goes to work every day and pays taxes, their share will be increased by 14%. In other words, individual Canadians will be paying a greater share of creating the fiscal capacity that we have in this country to pay for the programs and services that we all want to enjoy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011415">This growing imbalance is increasingly squeezing the average person at a time when personal debt is at an all-time high. Salaries are flat. More and more people are working full time and still below the poverty line. Individual savings are at a real low point. Most people do not have savings for a rainy day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011416">To summarize, what we are seeing in this budget is that for every dollar that the government is spending in services, programs and infrastructure, it is spending $6 on corporate tax cuts. Six to one is the ratio of spending in this budget. We disagree with it and that is why we have opposed it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011417">As I said, these tax cuts are shrinking our fiscal capacity. What does that mean? It means that we are not spending in the areas that we ought to be investing in, in spite of some of the very pressing needs that we have in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011418"> What could we have done with the money that the government is spending in corporate tax giveaways? We could have created 1.14 million child care spaces. We could have done that to help working families that are so squeezed when both parents are trying to make ends meet and still care for their kids.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011419">We could have added 74,000 hybrid transit buses that are clean, new and more accessible and, my goodness, even Canadian made. We could have put these on our streets, created a lot of jobs, kept a lot of people in work, created new jobs and created a big demand for all the auxiliary parts and services that go into this production.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011420"> We could have created 12.1 million units of non-profit affordable housing. Would that not have been something? That would certainly clear up the 70,000 families that are on the waiting list for affordable housing in my city of Toronto alone.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1011421">We could have invested in 25,000 MRI machines to help with some of the backlog in our health care system. We could have invested in our health care system so that Canadians could get the timely, efficient, good quality care that they need. We could have invested in annual health services for 10 million patients and made sure that our seniors, or anybody who needs health care, have the services in a timely fashion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011422">We could have helped with undergraduate tuition for 11 million students. That would have made an enormous difference for young people starting out in life rather than saddling them with an oppressive mortgaging of their future. We could have invested in their education and helped them get the kind of start that they ought to be getting in a country as wealthy as ours. We could have forgiven 2.1 million graduates of their student loans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011423">Unfortunately, supported by the opposition, the government has decided not to invest in all of these pressing priorities, whether it is child care, housing, health care, or the arts, many of the issues that are of concern to people in my riding of Parkdale--High Park.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011424">Another choice that the federal government made was to undermine one of the core adjustment programs that working people in our country need and that is our employment insurance program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011425">This program has already been significantly undermined by previous governments. It used to be our strongest program to help working people when they lost their job and needed to get into a new job. This program used to provide funding for unemployed workers. Some 80% of unemployed workers used to get EI to help them through their transition. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011426">As a result of cuts made by the previous government that significantly undermined who would get benefits and the level of their benefits, we find today that more than three-quarters of laid off people in the city of Toronto and about two-thirds across the country do not get employment insurance benefits. This is shocking. Is there any other insurance program where an individual cannot access the benefits even though he or she has paid the premiums? This defies logic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011427">Working people and employers across the country have been paying into the EI fund for some time, resulting in a surplus of $57 billion. Previous governments, as well as the present government, have used that money to pay down the debt or for other programs. People who have been paying into the fund and ought to be getting the benefits are in fact being denied the benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011428">What is the Conservative government doing? Rather than saying there is an imbalance between the money paid in and the abysmal level of benefits and services available as a result of the inadequacy of the EI program, the government has decided to take, or steal in fact, the $57 billion and set up a separate account that will not be accountable to this Parliament. That is shocking. That is a disgrace. That is a dishonour to unemployed workers across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011429">The decision by the government to change the immigration act and put so much discretion and power in the hands of the <Affiliation DbId="105834" Type="4">immigration minister</Affiliation> is a terrible betrayal of the hopes and dreams of newcomers who want to come to this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011430">Our system is far from perfect. There have been too many cutbacks in the system that have created a backlog. But too many people are now going to be denied the opportunity to come to this country because of the changes in this budget implementation act.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1011434">I wonder if she would like to take a moment to outline how that approach through the residential rehabilitation program, which has been cut in fact, would have an impact on her riding which is similar to mine.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1011435">Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is absolutely right. Not only was there no new money for affordable or social housing, for renovating or retrofitting existing homes, no money for a strategy to reduce homelessness, but there was no commitment to renew funding for the residential rehabilitation assistance program or RRAP funding. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011436">This funding has been used across the country to take substandard housing, these bachelorettes in Parkdale in my riding, and convert them into more liveable housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011437">It is shocking to see the number of people, who not only are homeless on the streets of Toronto but who live in such deplorable housing conditions. I see children living in apartments that are water damaged or mouldy. The apartments are cramped, dark and really substandard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011438">I do not think this program and others did the job. The national housing strategy has been abandoned. What this country needs is a massive investment in housing. We have a national housing crisis. We could have used some of this money and some of this fiscal capacity to invest in housing. Meanwhile people are being evicted. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011439">People could be living in safe, secure and affordable housing. Instead, we are seeing so much of it shovelled to those who already have so much. It defies logic and it defies any kind of humanity to approach our budget this way.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1011441">I am greatly surprised with the issue that the NDP brings up over and over. It is its objection to paying down debt. It is my distinct belief that when people borrow money, it is because they do not have enough for what they want to do. I would like to blame the Liberals from the 1970s on. They drove this country into huge debt from which we need to escape.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011442">The reason I think it is strange for the NDP to have this stance is that people who have more money than they need invest it and buy Canada savings bonds. People who are poor cannot. They are the working poor usually. They still pay taxes. We have a transfer of money from the poor to the rich when we have national debt. We need to get rid of that debt in order to stop that transfer. I am surprised that the NDP does not support the paying down of debt.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1011445">Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to stand again in Parliament and speak about the types of issues that the Conservative Party brings forth within a budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011446">We have an amendment now in front of us dealing with Bill <Document DbId="3354384" Type="3">C-50</Document> to separate some of the immigration issues that are extremely important to Canadians right across the country and in my riding as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011447">We think it is absolutely imperative that the heavy-handed legislation that has been introduced through the budget process be taken out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011448">For myself and the constituents I represent, the situation with immigration is horrendous. The backlog means loss of productivity and loss of sense of identity for many people across the country. We need to change that, yes, but to change it as it is proposed, where we could arbitrarily choose those we wish to reward with the benefits of a properly working immigration system is really wrong. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011449">We need to keep it democratic and we need to keep it fair across this country. That is why we have put this amendment forward and that is why we will continue to not support this bill as long it contains this type of effort.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011450">Having said that, I would like as well to talk about the budget and the budget implementation bill. In reality, I have actually been harangued by many in the Conservative Party about my position to not support the budget. So, I would like to explain that to people and get it on the record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011451">The other day the <Affiliation DbId="113996" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78843" Type="2">Macleod</Affiliation>, claimed that my constituents were extremely disappointed with me for not supporting the budget. I do not understand why he would say that, but he continued by saying that a member from the Northwest Territories who did not support a northern residents tax reduction was really failing his constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011452">When we look at the record, we will see that for the past eight years I have been fighting, in three elections, to put forward the concept that fairness within the northern residents tax deduction needs to be addressed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011453">In this Parliament, I have been consistently bringing this issue up and putting it on the order paper. I have worked with my constituents across the Northwest Territories and in the other northern territories to raise petitions and to bring attention to this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011454">It is nice to see that the Conservative Party has picked up on the issue, but it did not get the job done. A 10% increase to the northern residents tax deduction is simply a convenience to the Conservative Party so that it can say to the electorate “We did this”, when in fact what was required and was asked by all my constituents, whether they be labour, whether they be the chambers of commerce, or whether they be the legislative assemblies, was a 50% increase just to keep up with inflation for the past 20 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011455">The Conservative Party did not get the job done in this budget with the northern residents tax deduction and it should be ashamed to try to fool Canadians into thinking that it did.</ParaText>

He stood and harangued me for not supporting the budget. The Prime Minister took the time to tear into the member for <Affiliation DbId="79025" Type="2">Western Arctic</Affiliation> because I did not support the budget. The Prime Minister used the northern residents tax deduction as a convenient tool to try to increase the electoral chances of his party in my riding. What a shame-faced effort that was by the Prime Minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011457">That is the kind of common approach that I see this Conservative Party taking on so many issues for the north. It talks big about what it is doing for the north and yet everything it does has a hidden touch to it; it turns out to be less than what is expected.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1011459">In a territory that has extreme problems of distance, the cost to move police services across a vast area the size of one-sixth of the whole country of Canada, the government has offered up 70% of a police officer over the next five years to answer our needs. After the kinds of incidents in the north of over the last year with police, the troubles policemen have had, having to act on by themselves because they simply do not have the resources to implement the proper procedures used in normal situations and we this is what we get. Once again, the Conservative Party brags about a program that really amounts to nothing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011460">Then we go back to previous budgets wherein the Conservative government brought forward a new formula funding agreement, which at the time it touted as being very progressive. Once again, it was established that the funds would go to the three northern territories, not on what it would cost to provide services in the north, but on a per capita basis. Costs in the north are rising daily. The expanding economy in western Canada is driving up the costs to everyone to a great degree. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011461">After the wonderful work the Conservative Party did with the new formula financing agreement, the territorial government now says it is $135 million short. It will have to cut positions and very particular things that it needs to do to provide decent services within the Northwest Territories. Therefore, we have a problem right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011462">When we talk about the Northwest Territories, it is an area where money is being made. We in the Northwest Territories want to see devolution. We want to see revenue sharing from resources, which is an important thing for us, but we do not want to be shorted on that as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011463">When the Conservative government announced that it would continue the $500 million socio-economic fund to be set up for the pipeline, what did it say about it? It said that the fund would not be available until the pipeline was guaranteed and that the fund was okay because it would come out of the royalties that would be accrued to the Mackenzie gas project. That is not a subsidy. That is simply giving us the money that should be ours.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011464">If the Conservative Party is providing this fund to the north to mitigate socio-economic activities will come as a result of industrial expansion that will favour southern Canada, it should take that money out of the revenues that accrue to southern Canada, not the ones that come to the Northwest Territories. That is unfair. Once again it shows the nature of the Conservative Party when it comes to funding the north and giving it a fair share.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011465">What about the Norman Wells project? Oil has been pumped through that pipeline from Norman Wells for some 20 years. Right now, the federal government will not put it on the table in devolution. It will not put the revenue from that project on the table. The Conservatives say that it is their money, that they traded royalties for ownership of the pipeline, that they own 33% of the pipeline and they will not share it with us in the Northwest Territories. They say that they will not give us our fair share. What kind of deal is that? What kind of respect for the Northwest Territories is that from the Conservative Party?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011466">Would the Alberta MPs who sit in the House be satisfied with this kind of arrangement for their provinces? I do not think so. I think they would be up yelling like I am right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011467">When it comes to the diamond mines, when the original environmental assessment was set up, the benefits the Northwest Territories were to receive were employment and business opportunities based on a certain rate of production. Some of the mines are exceeding their production by 50%. Do we see the government standing up for our interests in this? No. It continues to let it go, with bigger profits and bigger taxes that will accrue to the federal government. Where does that leave the people of the Northwest Territories?</ParaText>

That was the amount of inflation taken out the benefit over that time. What is different about the northern residents tax deduction? Why did we only get 10%? Is that because we are second class citizens up there? Is that because we do not deserve that kind of benefit, that we are not working hard, that we are not contributing to Canada? I do not think so. I think it is because the Conservative Party is treating the north badly.</ParaText>

My hon. colleague opposite gave me an indication that he wanted to be brief and he was looking for me to, how shall I put it, be like the leopard that could change it spots and perhaps follow his example in brevity.</ParaText>

Even my hon. colleague from Montreal says it is absolutely important for us to stake out a position on this and make sure that we elucidate it with the clarity that we would have on this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011511"> I am going to try to do it. With all due respect to the parliamentary secretary, this bill, as I said, is extremely important, for a couple of reasons. One of them, of course, is that it falls into the great tradition of Liberal bills that have taken on another coat in this Parliament. It is one of the bills that our government, in its previous Parliament, put forward for consideration. I was pleased that the current government saw fit to emulate the example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011512">It came before the committee. In the committee, it received thorough discussion, and for the second reason. That second reason is that this is an important economic measure brought forth to ensure that the infrastructure of the ports system in Canada functions according to all of those means and all of those standards that we have come to label as purely Canadian, which are the following: first, transparent; second, efficient; third, building on all of the partnerships involved in ensuring that the ports system will be reflective of the infrastructure needs of this country; fourth, that it involve the people who are expert in the maintenance and in the running of these operations, according to the business models that we expect would pass the scrutiny of our own system, including the Auditor General; and fifth, it would ensure that the inefficiencies that might exist by virtue of the fact that smaller entities operating often in competition with each other are amalgamated into an environment and into an authority that can provide the services required not only by shippers, i.e. their main clients, but also by the macro needs of the country, and that is an efficient transportation system to get our goods and our services, but primarily our goods, to the foreign markets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011513">Members will recall that in the last Parliament we initiated a couple of gateways to the economic dynamics of Canada, an Atlantic gateway, a Pacific gateway and, as well, an internal Great Lakes gateway, a central Canada gateway. All of these required the appropriate measures to ensure that the port authorities could function as units, as economic business units capable of delivering an economic service and capable of surviving the operational challenges that come to operating a business that has to meet others' needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011514">It was important for us, especially in the committee, to understand that the ebb and flow of business patterns does change, but that these ports would be prepared to ensure that those changes in the economic cycles and in the special economic needs would be reflected in their capacities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011515">The parliamentary secretary and I tried to find common ground on this, as we found with the critic for the Bloc. I always forget what the name of the riding is, but he will forgive me, I am sure. I cannot mention that it is Monsieur Laframboise, so I will try not to, but we tried to find a common ground and make positive recommendations on how to improve legislation, and we did do that.</ParaText>

The member is always very good at speaking and is a great orator, and I know he wants to take credit for another Conservative bill that we got passed because the Liberals simply did not get it done for so many years, but notwithstanding that, this is debate is on the amendment. It is on the letter “a”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011517">I am wondering if the member could actually deal with the letter “a”, because that is what the amendment is all about. It is about bringing the French and the English into consistency. It is not about the bill itself. We have already dealt with that. Could the member deal with the amendment itself?</ParaText>

I will also take this opportunity to remind the hon. member for Eglinton—Lawrence that he cannot do indirectly what he cannot do directly. Perhaps he was trying to think of the riding name of Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel when he was referring to the member from the Bloc and will not use the member's proper name again.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1011520">Mr. Speaker, you will not find a more humble member than myself, and I am appreciative of the fact that you were able to assist me, while we were in the middle of debate, in remembering the hon. member's riding, <Affiliation DbId="78639" Type="2">Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel</Affiliation>, so I want to give him due credit. Now I am going to be forced to give everybody else due credit as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011521">I wanted as well to thank the parliamentary secretary, who has just illustrated how we operate cooperatively on the committee, because he has pointed that it is important to understand both the form as well as the substance of the letter “a”. If he is suggesting that perhaps by focusing on the letter “a”, which has ramifications for some of the economic and financial structures that are part and parcel of the bill in flowing to this particular amendment, I am only hoping that he will be at least as patient when I go through the other 25 letters of the alphabet associated with the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011522">However, he is absolutely right. We are talking right now about an amendment to all of that fine work that we put together as members of the committee. I want to say hats off to the new NDP member on the committee, who is struggling very hard to find something difficult with this bill, and I imagine he is going to have difficulty with the letter “a”. Otherwise, he is going to be absolutely happy with everything else.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011523">As I said, the other things that one would be happy with, the other 25 letters of the alphabet or the style associated with the “a”, have to do with giving these ports the opportunity to function as true financial entities capable of meeting the challenges of the economic cycles and the opportunity to access all of those benefits available to growing businesses under the infrastructure program. I know the parliamentary secretary would have wanted to say that too. I see him nodding his head, indicating yes, this is right, but I want to thank him as well for reminding me that people can colour a particular letter not only in style, but in a particular kaleidoscope of colours.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011524">However, any way we colour this letter “a”, the bill was getting it done, as they say. It has become part of the lexicon of the House now, “getting it done”, and it gets done because people in the House are men and women of goodwill and they develop that goodwill from an emotive and religious disposition, an ideological disposition, and convert it into political will.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011525">I think what has happened is that there has been an expression of political will to ensure that the bill does receive the support of the House and that when we bring it here, as we are doing now, to discuss nothing more than one small fragment of this great plan, the letter “a” in all of its style and all of its kaleidoscopic colours, really what we mean is the members of the committee, and there are many. I mentioned, of course, the member whom indirectly I could not mention but directly was able to with respect to his riding, and as well the parliamentary secretary. I do not want to lose sight of the fact that the chairmanship of the committee was such that it allowed us to work properly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011526">That is a lesson that some of the other chairs might learn. They could look at this and see that the positive legislation that has actually come forward in the House. Whether it has been under the letter “a” or the letter “b”, or whether it has come in red vestiges or blue coats, it has really been from that committee of transport.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011527">My hat goes off to my colleagues who worked on that committee together to ensure that we could present the bill. The only fly in the ointment was the letter “a” and I am glad that we are dealing with it today, so the letter “a” should be accepted as well and we would go on with this great bill.</ParaText>

The member did not propose an alternate letter and he did not propose that it should not be inserted, so it is indeed the most inane speech we have had in the House for weeks.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1011538">First of all, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78499" Type="2">Eglinton—Lawrence</Affiliation>, who spoke on behalf of the Liberal Party, was quite right to make the comments he did concerning this amendment. It is a very superficial amendment, but it is so important that it is delaying the passing of the bill. Once again, I have a very hard time listening to the parliamentary secretary, a Conservative member. They seem to want to blame the opposition when it comes to discussions on the amendment. Yes, it might seem very minor, since it is an amendment to align—which the Bloc Québécois will support—but it is also important to say that it is a mistake on the part of the government. If Bill <Document DbId="3101956" Type="3">C-23</Document> has not yet passed and, once again, the entire marine community does not benefit, it is because the bill was not completed by the Conservative government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011539">The Conservatives can say what they like. I would very much like to be able to support the government—in committee, the Conservatives were proud that the Liberal Party and the Bloc Québécois were supporting them—but I hope they will show a little respect here today when they ask us, once again, to vote in favour of this amendment. We will do so, but it is also very important that they understand that they are the framers of the bill. If there was a mistake in the bill, the Bloc Québécois and the Liberals are not to blame. It is the Conservative Party's fault.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011540">I trust it will be democratic and permit us to explain to all those listening, to the citizens in our ridings and to all those interested in marine transportation, that Bill <Document DbId="3101956" Type="3">C-23</Document> must be made complete and that this amendment will improve it. Yes, the Bloc Québécois will support it, but it is important also that the Conservatives understand that the bill was delayed because they did not do their job. Once again, they were in too much of a hurry to introduce the bill. Of course this is typical of the Conservative Party, which is not very rigorous in the way it operates. There is a reason why several committees are paralyzed in this House. That is how the Conservatives operate. However, they will never be able to prevent us from rising to point this out to them and to make them understand this, even if we do support them on occasion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011541">Bill <Document DbId="3101956" Type="3">C-23</Document>, first introduced by the Liberals, was reintroduced by the Conservatives. The Bloc Québécois supported it then and will do so today. We wish to help the marine transportation sector. However the bill must be complete.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011542">The proposed amendment is being made for consistency. Those following this matter closely will say that the devil is in the details. Today, this small detail is forcing the government to ask for the support of the House in order to adopt this amendment, which is an important one, even though it is small and consists of only one line. We want to prevent legal proceedings from being taken against the minister—in this case—which could jeopardize the application of all of Bill <Document DbId="3101956" Type="3">C-23</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011543">Naturally, I hope that the Conservative members and the parliamentary secretary will understand that it is important for the citizens watching us to know why such minor amendments are made. It is because they are important to an understanding of the law as a whole. We will need it if we ever have to go to court. We have to have a complete bill in order to prevent port authorities from having certain situations, that they believed could arise, challenged in court. That is why this amendment, although minor, is important. And, I will say it again, we will vote in favour of this amendment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011544">To us, everything is important. Every line, every sentence, every clause in Bill <Document DbId="3101956" Type="3">C-23</Document> is important. The government can count on the full support of the Bloc Québécois in implementing this bill, as amended by this amendment, which the government had neglected to make. Once again, the Conservative Party is the legislator and it had neglected this. Again, we can assure the government of our full support so that the marine sector can have space to develop. That is what was lacking.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1011545">This is what will enable Bill <Document DbId="3101956" Type="3">C-23</Document>, as amended, to really help the marine sector develop fully. The port authorities that own the ports and manage the land adjacent to seaports must be able to borrow the money they need and move forward. This bill will mean they can get what they need to develop and keep pace with the surge in marine transportation. This sector is expanding rapidly and needs Bill C-23, as amended by today's amendment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011546">I hope that the Conservatives will understand that this is important. People who followed the progress of Bill <Document DbId="3101956" Type="3">C-23</Document> in committee were wondering why it had not been adopted. It was because the bill contained a small typographical error that the Conservative Party had neglected to correct. Today that error has been corrected, and the Bloc Québécois is proud to support this measure in the interest of the entire marine sector.</ParaText>

It is a small amendment, but I would also like to thank the parliamentary secretary, as per his comments, for opening this up as a larger debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011554">He talked about people supporting this bill. He talked about how it is a Conservative bill as opposed to a Liberal bill.

              <ParaText id="1011557">This amendment is a glaring example of the type of work that needs to be done to actually put in a proper bill to update our ports, and we are supportive of that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011558">The amendment is a result of a mistake. It begs the question, “What other mistakes are in this bill?”, and that is the problem. I myself, as a committee person, have proposed several amendments to try to change the bill, to make it a better bill, to balance it out, and to make it more strategic. I have some examples, but I want to make sure first of all that viewers here understand that we are not here wasting taxpayers' money. We are talking about a very important bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011559"> I take offence in terms of the parliamentary secretary trying to blame the committee for missing this error. It was his government that decided to table this bill. It was his government, supported by the Liberals and the Bloc, that wanted to very easily pass this through committee and had plenty of opportunity to make sure that it crossed all its <I>t</I>'s, dotted all its <I>i</I>'s, and made all its <I>a</I>'s work out. But apparently it could not do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011560">The member for the Liberal Party said there were thorough discussions with regard to this. We really only had a few sessions at committee. In fact, it was passed very quickly through our committee and that is one of the reasons why there has been a mistake of this magnitude. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011561">It is really offensive for the parliamentary secretary to come in here and blame the committee, when the government really wanted to ram this through and it got help to do that. We really only had about an hour of time to study the bill clause by clause.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011562"> If the parliamentary secretary wants to talk about the sloppiness with respect to this issue, then he should be looking at himself and his government for not delivering a proper bill in its current context. That is the problem that they face.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011563">We made some amendments that we thought would add more substance to the bill. Apparently. the Conservatives did not add amendments that added substance; they added technical elements just to make sure it met language laws and would not end up in the court system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011564">However, we actually made amendments that were significant. One of those amendments was to subparagraph 8(2) of the act. We wanted to introduce the following:</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011566">The reason that we submitted that amendment as opposed to the government's amendment that we are talking about here is because this bill is going to reduce the board of directors in many types of port authorities across the country. That is problematic because it undermines the democratic representation that is necessary for those port authorities. What we are going to see now is government appointments taking on a higher prestige level than before.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1011570">Mr. Speaker, I think it is important. It really does go to the heart of the matter. How could a mistake like this on the “a”, the grammatical aspect, not be addressed? It was because we had moved so quickly with this bill and the process. It is connected. These things do not happen on their own. They happen because things have not been covered off to the fullest extent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011571">I was trying to illustrate with my one amendment here, and I have others, why it is so important to have that thorough discussion. If we could miss the letter “a” and actually change the language structure requirement necessary for the French translation, then what else could we miss? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011572">I am going to present at least a little bit of discussion with regard to this amendment to illustrate the seriousness of this. What else is missing? What other mistakes are there?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011573">The point I was trying to get across is that the amendment the government is making in this other bill by reducing the board of directors to a smaller component undermines democracy. It also undermines the ability for communities to be represented.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011574">The board of directors is going to one of five to eleven members, down from seven to fourteen. That means that the government appointees have a higher level of support or a higher level of direction which they did not have before. That bias creates all kinds of problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011575">The parliamentary secretary in trying to limit this debate, in his own words said he was supported by all other stakeholders. This is not true. That is not accurate. It is not factual.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011576">I have a letter that was submitted and we heard testimony. There was a group whose testimony was limited on that too. It was interesting because the time that was spent on the bill was rather quick not only in terms of the presentations of the government, but also presentations from those who were in favour and those opposed. In fact, we did not hear from a single port authority on its own. An association presented to the committee. What we did have were some objectors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011577">The parliamentary secretary should know this because he received a letter. He is saying it is supported by all stakeholders. Adam Vaughan, a city councillor from Toronto talked about the problems he had with this bill in his own constituency. The Toronto Port Authority is in his constituency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011578">There is not only this unilateral exclusive component of people who are in favour of this bill; there are those who are opposed and for legitimate reasons. The NDP opposes the bill for a number of reasons. This is an opportunity lost. The bill, for example, could have addressed other matters and it could have addressed things that related to better public policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011579">I know the Liberals and the Conservatives are even debating among themselves and trying to take credit for the bill. We think there could have been a better bill. That is why we had amendments in there that would address some of those things that we lost out on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011580">When we look at the glaring necessity for this amendment with respect to the letter “a”, what other things are missing in this bill? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011581">The bill is very important. It deals with the financing of the port authorities. The member for <Affiliation DbId="78499" Type="2">Eglinton—Lawrence</Affiliation> noted some of the important issues related to our ports. The ports are a historic element, which is recognized in the bill. If the letter “a” could be missed, it shows that there could have been more work done to improve the bill with other amendments. Hence we were very disappointed that we could not get those through.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011582">I am a member of the committee and a member of the House of Commons. I do not think that the Liberal member or the Bloc member and those who want to address this are wasting taxpayers' money in doing so. I hope the other parties appreciate that it should not be blamed on the committee alone for missing this amendment. There is a responsibility for the government to produce legislation that is going to work and that actually has the proper elements to it to test the mettle of the legal system. When there is an error such as this one, the government has to take some responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011583">It is wrong for the government to blame us for missing this in committee. Once again it highlights why the bill needs other amendments. The New Democrats have proposed amendments in order to make sure that the bill was more accountable, more open to the public and that it was going to be better for some of the smaller ports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011584">To the NDP this is an incomplete bill. We will be supporting the amendment, but not the bill itself.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1011585">Mr. Speaker, it is important to address some of the issues that have been raised in the intervention from the member for <Affiliation DbId="78884" Type="2">Windsor West</Affiliation>. I do that because he made reference to some of the objections that came from my own city of Toronto.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011586">Yes, three individuals came before the committee after it had heard all other interveners and stakeholders. Some of those stakeholders decided they would make a collective presentation as associations. We cannot fault them for having ironed out there difficulties among themselves in order to give a greater show of support. On that score, it is unfair for us to fault them for a strategy that resulted in what they thought would be good for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011587">With respect to the city of Toronto, there was no position by the city of Toronto. There was an individual from city council, as the member has rightly noted, who objected because the port was in part in his ward, but other members from council who also share that port did not come to give a negative position and the city itself did not have a council position against it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011588">The other two individuals who objected used language, and I know the member will appreciate this because he is a lawyer, that came very close to the kind of language that had been found in court to be to their disadvantage, where they had agreed that they would not use actions that verged on the libellous. I pointed that out in committee. If we are going to have a constructive and instructive debate, then let us have one that is measured both in language and in substance. Those three were the only ones of all the people who appeared before the committee who had a negative view and it was limited to one port, not the entire system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011589">It is unfair for anyone to suggest that the committee did not work to bring all of the appropriate amendments forward. The committee, in its collective wisdom, said the amendments that had been brought forward were not conducive to the approval of this bill and did not add anything to the bill, nor did they remove anything that was negative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011590">If, in the appropriate translation a letter “a” was left out, we know already what else could have been left out because all of the amendments were already considered in committee, all of them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011591">We have done our work honestly. I do not want to take credit for things that are not ours but, quite frankly, if colleagues on both sides of the House have done the work and have agreed collectively that this is what it is, then I think the House has an obligation to accept the work of its own creation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1011592">Mr. Speaker, I do not know where he got the idea that anyone is faulting the fact that the port authorities decided to go through their lobbyist element and their group association. I was simply pointing out that we did not hear from some of the smaller ports or all ports in this country about this particular bill. I think they would have added some valuable testimony and would have been something I would have appreciated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011593">It is not a question of blame or finding fault. I do not know where the hon. member gets that type of insinuation, because it certainly is not borne out in anything I said. What it identified, though, was the fact that we did not have some of the smaller ports and some of the more important ports in front of the committee. Maybe they would have actually found the amendment problem we have here today. Maybe they would have been the ones to point out our grammatical errors, I do not know. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011594">There at least has to be some acknowledgement that they were not at committee and it was a strategy that the port authority association took. That is fine. It is fair. I am not saying it is a bad one, it is the one they chose, but it certainly did not provide an opportunity to hear from all ports across Canada. That, to me, was a loss for us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011595">Second, with regard to the situation, it was very obvious that the member had difficulty when Mr. Vaughan came to committee. It was really a bizarre situation because the parliamentary secretary for the Conservatives actually tried to give up his time to the Liberals so he could question him further. I have never seen that in the years that I have been in Parliament. I have never even heard of the Conservative Party trying to give up time to the Liberals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011596">Nobody has suggested that the city of Toronto had an official position. That has never been presented by me or in this debate. Second to that, he was identified as a city council representative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011597">To me, today's debate is important because it signifies the fact that this legislation has problems and I will stand by that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1011598">Mr. Speaker, I would like to provide the House with some background on this legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011599">On November 16, 2007 the <Affiliation DbId="78771" Type="4">Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities</Affiliation> introduced Bill <Document DbId="3101956" Type="3">C-23, An Act to amend the Canada Marine Act, the Canada Transportation Act, the Pilotage Act and other Acts in consequence</Document>. This bill is very similar in most respects to its predecessor, Bill <Document DbId="1955931" Type="3">C-61, An Act to amend the Canada Marine Act and other Acts</Document>, which was introduced in the House of Commons on June 22, 2005 by the previous Liberal government. That bill died on the order paper with the dissolution of Parliament without having gone beyond first reading.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011600">In 1998 during the Liberal government's term in office the Canada Marine Act received royal assent. The Canada Marine Act was the first comprehensive legislation to govern several aspects of Canada's marine legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011601">In addition, the act allowed for the establishment of the Canada port authorities and continued the divestiture of certain harbour beds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011602">The Canada Marine Act assisted in the commercialization of the St. Lawrence Seaway and provisions for further commercialization of federal ferry services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011603">In 2003 the Canada Marine Act was subject to a legislative review. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011604">Since 2003 Transport Canada has carried out a number of studies from which it was able to compile several recommendations to improve the Canada Marine Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011605">Canada's 1995 policy framework for federal ports focused on the elimination of over-capacity and a new governance structure to support a more commercial system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011606">Global trading patterns have not changed the context in which the federal ports operate. Port modernization is required to ensure that ports have the tools needed to compete in a global trade environment and to support the government's new national policy framework for strategic gateways and trade corridors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011607">Currently, Canada port authorities are located at St. John's, Belledune, Halifax, Saint John, Sept-Îles, Saguenay, Quebec, Trois-Rivières, Montreal, Hamilton, Windsor, Thunder Bay, Port Alberni, Nanaimo, Prince Rupert, and Vancouver, which has been amalgamated with the Fraser River and the North Fraser.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011608">The amendments would include: a modification of the act's purpose; modification of a port authority's access to federal funding; adding provisions regarding the power of a port authority to borrow money; providing additional regulatory powers to the governor in council; adding provisions regarding port amalgamation; modifying provisions regarding the appointment of directors of port authorities; and finally, adding a penalty scheme and streamlining certain other important provisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011609">The Liberals supported the bill at second reading in order to send it to committee for further study. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011610">I would like to elaborate on the amendments, the first one being access to contribution funding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011611">Canada port authorities would be permitted to apply for contribution funding related to infrastructure, environmental sustainability, and the implementation of security measures. The borrowing limits are a tiered approach. They would be implemented to permit larger Canada port authorities, those with $25 million in operating revenues for three consecutive years, to move to a commercially based borrowing regime. Certain Canada port authorities would be subject to a code that governs borrowing in their letters patent rather than a fixed borrowing limit, as well as enhanced accountability requirements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011612">Under the amalgamation provisions, the legislation would include a provision that would allow for a consistent approach to facilitate any potential future amalgamations of CPAs and would complement the regulations established in May 2007 with respect to amalgamation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011613">With respect to governance, the bill incorporates new proposed amendments related to governance that are more responsible to Canada port authority needs and promote a more stable, long term management framework.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1011669">As I was saying, two weeks before Kevin strangled Michelle to death, he waited for her inside her darkened Regina home until she arrived later that night. Then he raped her, assaulted her and threatened to kill her if she went to the police. Despite this threat, Michelle made the brave choice to go to the police and ensure that he was charged for these awful crimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011670">Unfortunately, after spending one night in jail, Kevin was released on an undertaking not to contact Michelle and to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. The undertaking was reached by an agreement between the crown prosecutor and Kevin's defence lawyer. The judge who made the decision to release Kevin did not hear the facts of the case. I believe that if all pertinent information had been presented to the judge that day, Kevin would not have been freed on bail and, thus, we would have had a much different outcome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011671">With Kevin released from jail, Michelle tried to take measures to protect herself from him. She cut down the hedges outside her home. She installed extra lighting and locks. It was not enough.</ParaText>

The passage of the bill would give our hard-working crown prosecutors another tool to help them in their very difficult jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011680">The bill deals with those accused of a serious personal injury offence, as defined in the Criminal Code. It proposes that in those cases, before a judge rules on that person's release, the crown prosecutor shall present the judge with the prosecution's evidence relevant to the release of the accused. Subsection 515(10.1) would be added to the Criminal Code to achieve this amendment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011681">It is my hope that the bill will be passed by my hon. colleagues in the House. This legislation would place another check in our criminal justice system to help victims and would-be victims of serious violent crimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011682">Michelle's law is designed to apply only in limited circumstances. In order for this legislation to apply, the accused must be charged with a serious personal injury offence, as defined in section 752 of the Criminal Code. In order to alleviate claims that the bill would create too much pressure on our criminal justice system, I have deliberately not proposed that this provision be used in all cases where an accused is seeking bail. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1011683">According to that Criminal Code section, a serious personal injury offence must be an indictable offence of a certain severity. Examples of the types of offences included in this definition are attempted murder, manslaughter, criminal negligence, discharging a firearm, aggravated assault, assault with a weapon, or causing bodily harm, sexual assault, sexual assault with a weapon, and aggravated sexual assault.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011684">The heinous nature of these crimes warrants that the victims of these crimes be adequately protected. I want to emphasize today that I strongly support our crown prosecutors and the important and often unheralded work they do every day to keep us as citizens safe. Michelle's law is in no way meant as a criticism of their efforts. Instead I am trying to provide them with yet another tool to assist them in their difficult jobs with hectic criminal docket court schedules.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011685">Many members of the House may be familiar with another very recent case, which I suggest may not have occurred if the type of law we are debating today had been in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011686">In September 2007, in Oak Bay, British Columbia, just outside Victoria, Peter Lee murdered his wife, his six year old son and his wife's parents before he committed suicide. This terrible crime received significant national media attention, with its shocking brutality and ugly contrast to the beautiful Oak Bay neighbourhood in which it occurred.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011687">There is a striking similarity between this case and Michelle's case. Only about a month before Peter Lee took the lives of that entire family, he was charged with aggravated assault of his wife causing bodily harm and two counts of dangerous driving causing bodily harm. Police said that they believed Lee tried to injure his wife when he crashed his vehicle into a pole, causing his wife to break her arm.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011688">According to media reports, the Victoria police recommended to crown counsel that Lee not be released on bail. They were concerned that he posed a serious risk to his family. Unfortunately the crown prosecutor consented to Lee's release. This decision was signed off by a justice of the peace. Lee was placed under conditions not to contact his wife, visit the family home, visit their restaurant or possess any weapons. Again, this was not enough to prevent a horrific tragedy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011689">According to media reports, British Columbia's Attorney General Wally Oppal has said that crown prosecutors may not have had all the facts when they agreed to release Lee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011690"> Shortly after the murder-suicide, the province of British Columbia announced a coroner's inquest to investigate the handling of this matter. That coroner's inquest will take place in Victoria later this month. The findings from that inquiry will result in recommendations to try to prevent such a situation from happening again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011691">Since introducing my private member's bill, I have discussed my proposal with a highly respected crown prosecutor. In his view, a more effective solution to the problem which occurred in these two cases would be to place a reverse onus on an accused charged with a serious personal injury offence. That way the burden would be on the accused to satisfy the judge that the accused should be released pending the next court date.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011692">Currently many offenders in serious personal injury cases, even those involving murder, are released pending trial, even when a bail hearing is held. Thus the problem may be rooted in this system of judicial interim release.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011693">Since the Bail Reform Act was put into place in the 1970s, the onus for bail hearings in almost all criminal offences has been on the Crown. This has resulted in violent criminals being released, endangering our citizens. In fact, I understand that in many cases, crown prosecutors do not even pursue bail hearings because it is seen as a foregone conclusion that the accused will be released.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011694">Clearly this situation must be addressed. The needs and the rights of victims are not being protected under our current system. It is incumbent upon us as parliamentarians to change this law to protect the potential victims of heinous violent crimes.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="40">(1840)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1011695">Michelle's law starts the process. I ask all of my parliamentary colleagues to support this bill, to get it to the justice committee where members of all parties can look at amending this bill to institute a reverse onus clause for cases involving “serious personal injury offences”. This type of amendment would give this bill the teeth it requires so we can truly improve our criminal justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011696">The specific amendment I would present to the justice committee would be to amend the Criminal Code by adding the following short clause in the reverse onus section, subparagraph 515(6)(a)(v). I would add, “(vi) with a serious personal injury offence as defined in section 752”. That section 752 definition of “serious personal injury offence” is the same definition as the earlier provision included in my private member's bill.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1011703">Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for his comments. It must be especially gratifying and yet difficult because in his remarks he indicated that he knew the individuals involved in the case which spurred him to bring Bill <Document DbId="3130036" Type="4">C-519</Document> before the House tonight. I respect his courage in bringing the matter forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011704">However, I feel, as a reviewer of legislation, that we have to look at the legislation before us. We have to look at the reasonable likelihood that what has been presented will become law. I cannot continue talking about Bill <Document DbId="3130036" Type="4">C-519</Document> without talking about the big picture of whether this bill, if sent to committee, will ever become law. That is largely due to the state of dysfunction that we find ourselves in at the justice committee which I have served on for two years since my election to Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011705">It is only recently, I might add in a note of partisan comment. The point being that up until recently legislation has been flowing through that committee. I would say a lot of legislation has been flowing through that committee. I might add, and without a lot of compliments to the other side with respect to the workload of the justice committee, that the committee has been loaded down with many laws that have been promulgated by the ruling party to backlog it with respect to many bills. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011706">In a way, I feel that it would almost be disingenuous for us to promise the member that in sending this bill to committee that it will become law, unless, as I make this plea, we come to a reasonable solution to the simple question of why do we not follow the rules around here. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011707">There are rules of procedure. We have to forget for a moment the merit of a debate. Forget whether he or she is right or wrong. We should follow the rules of procedure in this place. That is my lofty preamble on what committees do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011708">Should this bill be sent to committee, I think the committee would have a very large task in taking subsection (10) of section 515 of the Criminal Code and morphing it on to subsection 515(6).</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011709">I would be very open to hearing the other comments of hon. members and from witnesses with respect to whether such amendments would be in order. I too have grave misgivings, as I think now the mover of this bill has about the efficacy of the bill as presented. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011710">I too have sought the opinion of crown prosecutors who I respect. They too have suggested that Bill <Document DbId="3130036" Type="4">C-519</Document>, the amendment of subsection (10) to add (10.1) to section 515 of the Criminal Code would impose a positive obligation on the Crown to do something and that is to produce all the evidence it has. This was not there before.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011711">In effect, it is a good case of a well intentioned bill actually doing harm to the process. I think it is important. What I mean by this is that the mover of the bill moved quickly from saying that the bill is meant to do this, but now he has talked to prosecutors and he wants to do something else. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011712">Clearly, at committee we would be open to that and that is fine. It is important to lay down the tracks that Bill <Document DbId="3130036" Type="4">C-519</Document>, as presented, is fatally flawed if we stay within subsection 515(10) or try to add to it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011713">I want to explain it as simply as I understand it. We are talking about an application for judicial interim release, which must happen sometime between 24 hours and 3 days after individuals are charged and detained of an offence involving a serious personal injury as the facts present here, that is, if they assault someone, typically a spouse. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011714">If they do this on a Friday night, then they will have a bail hearing, depending on the jurisdiction and the availability of judges, for judicial interim release on the Sunday or the Monday, who knows, and at that hearing now the Crown does not have a positive obligation. It is not required to show the judge all the evidence it has to support why the person should not be released. The Crown must only make the case or show cause as to why the person should be detained.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="50">(1850)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1011715">There are many elements in the Criminal Code that suggest that if a person is a flight risk, will do harm again, is under a certain warrant of arrest now or is under certain obligation from the court by way of charge, then he or she should be detained. That is the show cause part of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011716">With respect to certain offences, more grave offences, and this is where the member is going but he did not pigeon hole it in his bill, there is an onus on the accused to show why they should be released. That has been the law for some time. To label it a reverse onus right away and to say that this is something new, I do not think is productive to our criminal law evolution but it is in the Criminal Code. It has been for some time, that on very serious offences the accused must show cause why they should be set free. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011717">If that is where we are going to go in committee, I welcome the discussion. Let us hear the evidence. Let us look at the other offences that are included in subsection 515(6) and see whether the serious personal injury offence fits within the tenure of those offences, if they are adequately serious with respect to the other offences. Let us hear the testimony from crown prosecutors as to how this will affect their everyday work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011718">Bill <Document DbId="3130036" Type="4">C-519</Document>, as it exists, burdens prosecutors and may in fact, by having them show evidence that they are not ready to present, damage further investigation or the leads that they have with respect to other crimes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011719">It may in fact lead to the anomalous situation where in order to get the order for detention, crown prosecutors would have to give a file to a judge which is virtually empty and if a fact scenario of a crime was committed on a Friday and on Sunday morning one expected a file replete with witness statements, medical information and other information, one is dreaming to think that would happen. That is not efficacious. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011720">The spectre of having the victim be the evidence by giving viva voce evidence, a hearing to remand the person who beat her up three days earlier, is completely out of the norm of what we would expect with respect to respect for victims rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011721">The law, as drafted, and I commend my hon. friend for his intention, is fatally flawed. If at committee we hear evidence that serious personal injury is in the realm of the other offences identified in subsection 515(6), then the committee, if it gets to work, if the backlog, the log jam or legalistic haranguing is gone, if we can get down to business as we did for two years previous, then we can look at this bill and maybe we can fix it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011722">With that, in conclusion I would like to say that the book called the Criminal Code is an organic thing. It has been with us a long time and it is probably one of the best things that has come out of our marriage between a common law jurisdiction and our vicinity or neighbourhood with the civil law of France and the civil code, and our proximity to the United States frankly. It is somewhere in the middle of the U.S. criminal codes and the common law in Europe as we took it in around 1867, and it is ours.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011723">If we look at it, and the public should know, there is hardly anything really new that can be added to the Criminal Code. It grows like a plant and what we are trying to do here is see if the horrible crime that my friend describes can be put into this organic document, and it can be made sense of. It has to apply, with all respect, to every fact situation involving a serious personal offence and not just a heinous and egregious crime that he described, and to which he was so close personally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011724">I will do my part, this is a private member's bill, to ensure to the hon. member that the committee gets working, that his bill gets sent to committee, and that we try to save it and to do justice to the memory of Michelle. We want to ensure other victims, who will be hopefully helped by the fact that we did our work here on this night in Parliament, that the committee tomorrow or the next day will do its work.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="78559" Type="2">Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1011725">Mr. Speaker, I thank my party for allowing me to speak this evening. It is a great privilege.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011726">I must tell my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78724" Type="2">Palliser</Affiliation>, that the Bloc Québécois is not opposed to this bill. We will support it so that it can be referred to the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. I obviously hope that the committee resumes its work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011727">As an aside, we are chaired by the very impetuous member for <Affiliation DbId="78732" Type="2">Calgary Northeast</Affiliation>, who is a former police officer. He has unfortunately made rulings that do not comply with the Standing Orders. Since then, committee work has come to a stop. On the opposition side, the committee is made up of likeable, reasonable people who want to put in an honest day's work, but unfortunately we are unable to do so because the committee is not sitting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011728">That said, I think that our fellow citizens need to understand the contents of this bill. In our justice system, there are two types of pre-trial release. In the bill, the member is referring to section 515 of the Criminal Code, which has to do with judicial release, often referred to as release on bail. Bail is a condition that will determine whether or not a person who has yet to go to trial will be released, provided he or she abides by some conditions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011729">The conditions can be financial. In this case, the individual could be required to deposit a sum of money. The conditions can be related to movements. The justice of the peace can order individuals to stay in the city, to hand over their passport, or can prohibit them from contacting the victim. A justice of the peace can impose all kinds of conditions as part of the judicial release. So, in his bill, the member is referring to section 515 of the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011730">There are also situations where it is not possible to be released from custody, for example, for an offence set out in section 469 of the Criminal Code. The justice of the peace must keep a person in custody if he or she has been convicted of murder and, obviously, very serious offences. There are also situations which involve reverse onus, for example, when an individual is accused of terrorism or gang-related crimes. The accused must prove that he or she is not a threat to society. Only by proving this to a justice of the peace can the individual be released.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011731">The hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78724" Type="2">Palliser</Affiliation> wishes to include a very clear provision in the Criminal Code stating that in the case of a serious personal injury offence, an individual cannot be released on bail until the justice of the peace has been presented with evidence. We are talking about murder, manslaughter, a number of sexual offences and violent crimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011732">To the Bloc Québécois, that does not seem to be unreasonable; it is certainly founded. With his bill, the member is correcting the current situation whereby if the Crown does not oppose releasing the individual, the prosecutor may not have to present evidence or the circumstances under which the offence was committed. The Bloc Québécois is not opposed to this bill.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="00">(1900)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1011733">We did have information according to which, in the case of serious injury, the Crown does not allow individuals to be freed. Very often, we have information stating that the evidence has been presented.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011734">All the same, our colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78724" Type="2">Palliser</Affiliation> made statements in this House to illustrate that that was not done in at least one case, and that unfortunately, that case turned out to be fatal for his friend Michel. We fully understand the battle he plans to fight, and we will support him in that. This kind of work certainly gives meaning to the activities of parliamentarians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011735">We know that we also have to be rigorous in criminal law cases, because criminal law can result in the deprivation of liberty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011736">I do not know if the Bloc Québécois will support the bill as written. We will be pleased to hear witnesses, but the committee has to do its work, of course. I must tell the House that at least three committees are currently experiencing obstruction because the Conservatives are refusing to follow the Standing Orders. However, I do not hold the member for <Affiliation DbId="78724" Type="2">Palliser</Affiliation> responsible. He is a likeable, naturally gregarious man, and a good-natured businessman. Therefore, I do not hold him responsible for the bad behaviour of certain other committee chairs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011737">For instance, the work of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development and, until very recently, the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs was obstructed because, unfortunately, members of the government majority refused to cooperate and enforce the regulations. However, I do not hold the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78724" Type="2">Palliser</Affiliation> responsible for his colleagues' misdeeds and he will have the support of the Bloc Québécois, so that we can study the bill once the committee reconvenes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011738">This leads me to emphasize that extreme caution is required when it comes to matters of criminal law. I cannot fully go into it at this time. We must appreciate the witnesses who appear before us and appreciate the testimony of our colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78724" Type="2">Palliser</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011739">The Bloc Québécois has always been extremely cautious when it comes to reverse onus. It can be justified under certain circumstances, but the notion of reverse onus requires considerable caution. As we all know, reverse onus goes against the presumption of innocence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011740">I must say that in the past, under certain circumstances, the Conservative government asked us for reverse onus. We did not agree because we did not believe it to be necessary. I will reserve judgment until we have completed our work in committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011741">The Bloc Québécois, because it is a responsible party and the leading political force in Quebec, also presented recommendations in June 2007. I did so with my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78327" Type="2">Châteauguay—Saint-Constant</Affiliation>, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78405" Type="2">Marc-Aurèle-Fortin</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="78819" Type="2">Ahuntsic</Affiliation>. At the request of the Leader of the Bloc Québécois, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78493" Type="2">Laurier—Sainte-Marie</Affiliation>, I chaired a working group to recommend measures to improve the judicial system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011742">I have to say that I made a certain number of recommendations. When it is my turn—I am the 123rd member on the list—I may table a bill to implement these measures. Or I may table a bill to fight poverty. I hope that, with the help of my friends, I will have the support of all my colleagues in this House. <Sup /></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011743">To conclude, I congratulate the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78724" Type="2">Palliser</Affiliation> on his bill. I wish him well in his fight to honour the memory of Michelle. We will be pleased to listen seriously to the witnesses who come before the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. I wish him all the best in the future.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1011744">Mr. Speaker, it is difficult to speak to this bill when I think of the tragedy the member for <Affiliation DbId="78724" Type="2">Palliser</Affiliation> described and which, obviously, he experienced on a close personal basis. I could not help but think of identifying with him. Fortunately, I have never had the experience of having a close friend or family member brutally murdered but I have had several clients over the course of my career who have suffered similar types of assaults and ultimate murders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011745">The inevitable human response is to question our criminal justice system, to question whether we could have done better, whether it is the conduct of our police forces, our prosecutors, our judges or, yes, we here as parliamentarians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011746">My colleague from Palliser, through this bill, has given a very real sense of the pain that he went through.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011747">However, I have some concerns about the bill. It is appropriate that we, in our role as parliamentarians, look, on a constant basis, at the Criminal Code to see if there are ways to make it better in order to better protect our society as a whole and our citizens individually. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011748">That obviously is the role that the member for <Affiliation DbId="78724" Type="2">Palliser</Affiliation> is playing here as he brings forth this private member's bill. I acknowledge that and congratulate him in that regard. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011749">I think the member mentioned having contact with prosecutors in his home province. I think we all recognize the burden we place on the prosecutors and, to some degree in this process, on our police officers, the insistence that they be perfect. However, they are human beings and they are not perfect, nor are judges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011750">I have a question with regard to the approach in this bill. Are we placing, and we heard this to some degree from the member for <Affiliation DbId="78457" Type="2">Moncton—Riverview—Dieppe</Affiliation>, an additional burden on prosecutors when we know they have great difficulty meeting the burden at this period of time in the process that involves whether a person will receive an interim custodial order or whether they will be released on bail? The bill clearly would place additional burdens on them if it were to ultimately become law as an amendment to the code. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011751">It has been my experience, from the time I first started practising a long time ago right up to the present in terms of my discussions with crown prosecutors right across the country, that our expectations of what they can do--and the same is true of our police officers when they are involved in this stage of the criminal justice proceedings--and what they can present in a timely, efficient manner to a justice of the peace or a judge. They simply cannot do it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011752">We saw it in the tragedy this past weekend in British Columbia when those three young children were killed. We are hearing some recriminations. I do not know what the reality is. It is clear that the police wanted the person held in custody. Fingers were pointed initially at the justice of the peace for having released the person but now we are hearing evidence from Mr. Wally Oppal, the Attorney General of B.C., that not all the facts were in front of the justice of the peace. That is a classic case and it happens all too often in our country.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="10">(1910)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1011753">It is about resources. It is about giving our prosecutors and police sufficient resources and time, which means we need more of them, to present cases so that our judiciary, whether justices of the peace or judges, have the facts before them so that they can make a fully informed decision as to whether the person should be granted bail or kept in custody until trial.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011754">I have to say that I do not see that this is going to help. In fact it will impose additional burdens. The amount of evidence that will have to be presented based on what is proposed in Bill <Document DbId="3130036" Type="4">C-519</Document>, in my estimation, would double, triple, maybe quadruple the workload of the prosecutors at that stage. It is going to at least double it. That would require more resources if we are going to do this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011755"> I have to say to my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78724" Type="2">Palliser</Affiliation> that as much as I admire him, and I agree with the other parties that we are going to have this come to the justice committee, if we can ever get it functioning again, it behooves the member for Palliser and the government to take a look at the resources that we are providing to our prosecutors in particular, and to a lesser degree, our police around this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011756">As a bit of an aside, but it is relevant, I remember the huge fight that prosecutors had in Ontario in terms of their own personal compensation. They were grossly underpaid for a long period of time and only recently, I would say in the last 10 years, have they finally been able to catch up. As they fought for more appropriate wages reflective of their experience, education and the job load that they carried, they kept saying to various attorneys general in Ontario, “ More important, we need more prosecutors because we can't carry this workload. You can pay me double what I am getting now, but I can only work so many hours a week, at which point I collapse. Whether you pay me $100,000 or $150,000 or $200,000 a year, it doesn't matter because I can only work 60 to 80 hours a week and do a decent job. We need more prosecutors and it is really as simple as that”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011757">I would say to my friend that is one issue I would point out to him that he may want to try to advocate. I would urge him to advocate with his colleagues in government to look at this area and see that we get more prosecutors, and probably justices of the peace as well, to deal with this particular problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011758">I want to raise another issue. He indicated that he will be seeking an amendment to the bill when it gets to committee. I want to caution him that he needs to look at whether the amendment he is proposing is going to be acceptable as an amendment. My preliminary reaction is that it is beyond the scope of the bill. I cannot see any way of correcting it, but he has to look at that. There is some real advantage to taking a look at reversing the onus in some cases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011759">In that regard, within the last six or eight months we passed a bill through the House and ultimately through the Senate reversing the onus on bail in the situation where guns were involved. That made sense. We have similar provisions in other areas. It may make sense to do it here, but I have to tell him I am not sure it is going to get by the legislative clerk in the justice committee, again if the justice committee starts functioning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011760">I want to commend my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78724" Type="2">Palliser</Affiliation> on the work that he has done on this. Hopefully we can resolve some of the concerns I have raised when the bill finally gets to committee.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1011761">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill <Document DbId="3130036" Type="4">C-519</Document>, which proposes to amend the bail provision of the Criminal Code to address serious personal injury offences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011762">The member who sponsored the bill represents the riding of Palliser. He is a fine addition to this side of the House. He does an amazing job here in Ottawa on behalf of his constituents, even though it is a bit of a plane ride back to Pallister, Saskatchewan. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011763">
                <B>An hon. member:</B> Palliser.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011764">
                <B>Mr. Rick Dykstra:</B> He is certainly not afraid to bring forward the will of his constituents here in the House of Commons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011765">My colleague is inviting us to discuss what I believe is a very important and a very serious issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011766">This bill asks us to examine how bail decisions are made in certain cases where the prosecutor and defence counsel have agreed to the release of the accused. Ultimately, this reform would not only ensure greater transparency and openness, but it would also ensure that the safety of the victim and the public were fully considered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011767">Bill <Document DbId="3130036" Type="4">C-519</Document> proposes that the prosecutor be required to present evidence that is relevant to the release of the accused before a judge or justice of the peace makes an order for release on bail. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011768">Therefore, it appears that this bill seeks to ensure that a bail court receives all of the relevant information that it needs in order to make an informed decision about the pretrial release of an accused.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011769">This new obligation would not apply in all cases but rather only in cases where the accused has been charged with a serious personal injury offence and where the prosecutor and the defence have agreed that the accused can be granted bail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011770">Serious personal injury offences are defined in section 752 of the Criminal Code as indictable offences that involve the use or attempted use of violence against a person, or conduct endangering the life or safety of another person, or conduct inflicting severe psychological damage on the person and for which the offender may be sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum of 10 years or more. It also includes sexual assault, sexual assault with a weapon, and aggravated sexual assault. Bill <Document DbId="3130036" Type="4">C-519</Document> is correctly limited to addressing these serious offences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011771">It should also be noted that Bill <Document DbId="3130036" Type="4">C-519</Document> does not alter the existing standards with respect to bail. It does not change the grounds for detaining an accused. The presumption of innocence and the constitutional right not to be denied bail without just cause are not affected by this proposal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011772">The law provides that in general, accused persons benefit from a basic presumption in favour of release. As detention results in a complete loss of liberty, the law states that bail shall only be denied when there is just cause to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011773">The current Criminal Code provisions set out specific grounds to justify keeping someone in custody before trial. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011774">Under what is commonly referred to as the “primary ground”, bail can be denied when detention is necessary to ensure that the accused does not flee from justice and appears before the court when he or she is required to do so. Under the “secondary ground”, bail can be denied to protect the public. As an example, if there is a substantial likelihood that the accused will reoffend or interfere with the administration of justice if released, bail can be denied. Last, bail can be denied under the “tertiary ground”, which is when the court considers it necessary in order to maintain confidence in the administration of justice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011775">The prosecutor normally has the onus of demonstrating why it is justified to detain an accused before trial.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011776">This bill does not change these basic tenets, nor does it require the prosecutor to seek to detain an accused charged with a serious personal injury offence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011777">The summary of the bill clearly states that it is intended to apply in what are commonly referred to as consent release cases.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="20">(1920)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1011778">I would like to take a moment to describe the process around the arrest, the release or detention of accused persons in order to clarify at which stage Bill <Document DbId="3130036" Type="4">C-519</Document> would apply and to put it into context.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011779">When a person is arrested without warrant by the police, officers must release the person from custody unless they believe, on reasonable grounds, it is necessary to have that person detained. The purpose of detaining the individual may be based on the need to protect victims of, or witnesses to, the offence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011780">Officers must decide when to release the accused with or without conditions, or to detain the accused so that the accused may be brought before a judge or justice of the peace for what is referred to in the Criminal Code as a judicial interim release order, commonly referred to as bail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011781">When police officers believe that there are reasonable grounds not to release an accused, they are required under the law to bring them before a judge or justice of the peace within 24 hours, or as soon as possible if a justice of the peace is not available within those 24 hours.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011782">Generally speaking, the type of information that will be available at this stage is the police incident report. The police report is a summary of the offence and the accused's criminal record and prior incidents that required police attention or intervention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011783">The accused's conduct since being detained may also be taken into account if the accused has displayed aggressive or threatening behaviour, or made statements that raised concerns about the safety of victims or witnesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011784">In addition, the accused's lawyer or defence counsel on duty in bail court often provide additional information, which is of course relevant to the release of the accused. For example, they will indicate what measures have been sought in order to ensure that the accused will be able to respect the conditions of his or her release.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011785">Depending on the relevant concerns, they will provide information such as the following: whether the accused will have a surety or a person that will help them to comply with their conditions; whether the accused will provide a cash deposit as a bail security; whether the accused will agree to comply with specific conditions such as reporting to police as required or residing at a particular location, just to name a couple.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011786">Therefore, with information coming from both police and defence counsel, there are cases where prosecutors will be satisfied that the accused can be safely released with those conditions. In these instances, the Crown can decide to consent to the release of the accused and not seek to show cause why it is justifiable to detain the accused in pretrial custody.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011787">It should be noted that in certain situations and causes, the law states that the accused shall be detained unless he or she shows cause why detention is not justifiable. These are commonly referred to as reverse onus. We have talked about this at the justice committee on a number of occasions in the last couple of years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011788">These situations apply in specific cases, such as where the accused is charged with breaching his or her bail, committing another indictable offence, trafficking or smuggling in drugs, and as of May 1 of this year, trafficking or smuggling in weapons as well. Therefore, Bill <Document DbId="3130036" Type="4">C-519</Document> would only apply where the prosecutor has decided to consent to the release of an accused charged with a serious personal injury offence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011789">In conclusion, the bill seeks to ensure that in such cases, all evidence that is relevant to the release of the accused is put on the record before the judge or justice makes the bail release order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011790">I certainly stand here in the House today to lend my support to this bill and get it to committee. I look forward to having the member present at justice committee, of which I am a member. I know it will be a great day when the member is there and is able to present his thoughts on the bill and any positive changes that may be made to it. I think it is indicative of the House that all parties at least support it at second reading so that Bill <Document DbId="3130036" Type="4">C-519</Document> has the opportunity to be presented at committee.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1011794">The bill addresses an important aspect of the bill system. More specific, the bill provides that where an accused is charged with a serious personal injury offence, as defined under section 752 of the Criminal Code, the prosecution shall present all the relevant evidence in its possession before a justice makes an order for the release of the accused.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011795">Bail has been described earlier. The type of evidence that would be required is all the evidence that is relevant to the release of the accused, including all relevant evidence respecting the alleged offence and its commission.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011796">As the bill summary notes, the purpose of the proposed reform is to ensure that an accused in such a case is not granted bail as a result of an agreement between the prosecutor and the defence counsel without the judge being fully informed by all of the relevant evidence in the possession of the prosecutor. As the member mentioned in his original comments, he personally knew the people involved in the crime of which he spoke and it is important that these relevant pieces are taken into account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011797">Bill <Document DbId="3130036" Type="4">C-519</Document> is a private member's bill, not a government bill. Regardless, I am of the view that the bill is consistent with the government's overall crime platform. The government's criminal law reforms have sought to ensure the justice system operates in an effective manner in order to protect victims. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011798">For example, in the last session of Parliament, Bill <Document DbId="2172003" Type="3">C-9</Document> was passed in order to prevent the use of conditional sentences, which also refer to house arrest for offences proceeded on indictment that carry a maximum sentence of 10 years. Bill <Document DbId="2250003" Type="3">C-18</Document>, the DNA databank legislation, also received royal assent, thereby strengthening the Criminal Code regime with this powerful crime solving tool. Also street racing laws were passed with the proclamation of Bill <Document DbId="2277339" Type="3">C-19</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011799">In this session of Parliament, Bill <Document DbId="3076458" Type="3">C-2</Document>, the Tackling Violent Crime Act, received royal assent. This important omnibus bill addresses a broad range of concerns. It tackles serious gun crimes by imposing higher minimum sentences for imprisonment and tougher bail rules. It allows stricter conditions and more effective sentencing and the management of dangerous and high risk offenders. It raises the age of consent for sexual activity to protect our youth from sexual predators. It strengthens the laws against impaired drivers to protect Canadians from those who drive under the influence of drugs or alcohol.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1011803">Mr. Speaker, in February I asked a question in this House concerning the federal government's lack of interest in the recent job losses in Canada's automotive industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011804">On that day General Motors in the United States announced the largest loss ever and the elimination of 74,000 jobs. At that very same time Kitchener Frame, Kitchener's largest automotive part maker, indicated it would be shutting its doors and eliminating 1,200 jobs in my community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011805">The region of Waterloo is home to over 62,000 workers who make their living in the manufacturing sector. Several companies, particularly those involved in the automotive sector, have made deep cuts in their workforce or have closed their doors entirely.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011806"> Ledco Ltd. closed its doors this year, after 76 years in operation; Lear Corporation laid off close to 300 employees prior to the new year; Nova Steel shut its doors entirely, this month; and BFGoodrich shut its doors last year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011807">This is a serious crisis and it is having a tremendous impact on the economy of <Affiliation DbId="78469" Type="2">Kitchener Centre</Affiliation>. The crisis in the automotive sector is having a devastating effect in communities right across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011808">However, the government continues to ignore calls for an automotive policy. Ottawa's reluctance to intervene on behalf of the automotive sector is both disappointing and, frankly, quite surprising. It is surprising because these companies are faltering through little fault of their own.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011809">I think it is fair to say that Waterloo region is home to one of the most resilient, determined, innovative and diverse economies in this great country of ours. At various times in our history, Waterloo region has been known as the furniture capital of Canada, the button capital, the shoe making capital, and the rubber capital.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011810">In spite of deep cuts, it remains an automotive capital with an expanding presence due to Toyota. Food processing has been a mainstay in Kitchener and Waterloo region for more than 100 years. There is diversification beyond manufacturing with a large financial services component through Manulife Financial and Economical Insurance, as well as other insurance companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011811">We have embraced the new economy with a tremendously vibrant high tech industry. Waterloo region is a good news story, but even at that the manufacturing sector has been hit very hard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011812">Some of these plants in my constituency of <Affiliation DbId="78469" Type="2">Kitchener Centre</Affiliation> are seeing some of their highest productivity rates ever, but despite this, they have lost their markets. They are well-versed in the causes of the manufacturing slowdown. The strong Canadian dollar has erased Ontario's economic advantage and encouraged companies to shift production to the United States or Asia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011813">Further, the slowdown in the U.S. economy has had a huge impact on the Waterloo region's economy since the majority of the goods manufactured in Waterloo region, and I dare say across Canada, are shipped to the south, the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011814">The manufacturing industry as a whole has been facing significant challenges in recent years as a result of the rapid, unexpected rise in the Canadian dollar, increased competition from emerging economies as well as the higher energy prices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011815">This Conservative government remains unwilling to address these big problems. I am not certain if it lacks vision or courage, or perhaps both. It is impossible to imagine that--</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1011839">Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to raise the point pursuant to what we discussed during question period on February 26. My question for the <Affiliation DbId="105841" Type="5">Secretary of State</Affiliation> responsible for Canadians abroad dealt with the fact that she had taken the time to go to Mexico but failed to actually address the issue of meeting with Brenda Martin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011840">We know that Brenda Martin has been languishing in a prison for the better part of the past two years. Despite repeated attempts by our party and by this member in particular, attempts in the foreign affairs committee, in late shows like this one and with questions in the House, it seems impossible to understand where and how the government sets its priorities, particularly when there is evidence that a Canadian has been literally railroaded and denied her rights, not only from a Canadian perspective, but under Mexican law in and of itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011841">My question for the minister at the time was why could she not take the time to visit Brenda to demonstrate and create a link to Mexican authority in recognition of the fact that we were not interfering with the judicial system but were instead sending a message to Mexicans that we were not exactly pleased with the way in which their judicial system had treated Brenda Martin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011842">There are plenty of examples of past cases like this. Particularly in dealing with this one, I note with thanks the efforts of people such as Charles Rusnell of the <I>Edmonton Journal</I>. His investigative work in the background has made it possible for us to focus on this question and bring into play the fact that her fundamental rights were denied. In particular, she was not given access to an interpreter. As well, there is the fact that she has been imprisoned with other convicted felons, felons under the Mexican state, which we are not second guessing, individuals who have committed crimes and been found guilty. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011843">She has not been found guilty of anything. There has been a pretrial incarceration of over two years. Desperately, Ms. Martin sought the help of her government to at least pick up the phone from time to time. The same minister failed to do that and, I suggest respectfully to this House, demonstrated a distinct lack or dereliction of her responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011844">I am very concerned that what I raised on February 26 was also raised again by the Canadian Press story, which went further and confirmed the fact that the minister seemed to be given to swilling back Perriers and canapés as opposed to spending 18 minutes to travel to see Brenda Martin. it is very critical that such was the case. It demonstrates a clear lack of experience by the minister. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011845">There are members on that side of the House who have very good talents and who understand consular affairs. I am hoping that what comes out of this will indeed be an opportunity by the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to change the lineup, to change the batting order so that we actually have people who can get onto these cases from the get-go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011846">I led the consular affairs division for a couple of years and I can tell members that once engaged it was second to none. Most nations have no difficulty becoming involved and I think no less of our ability to do the same. This has been a very public issue with respect to the plight of Brenda Martin. We are hopeful that she will be released, that the judges will find their way to freeing her. We know that Alyn Waage, who was responsible for the fraud scheme, himself has exonerated her twice and has written two affidavits pursuant to the court. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011847">However, let us understand that in this case the prosecutor made the charges so difficult there is no way Brenda Martin can get out without the help of her government. We are asking the Canadian government to get involved, including the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, by ensuring that the Prime Minister himself not only picks up the phone but also observes that when an international treaty is broken he has an obligation to stand up for Canadians. We did it on this side of the House. We expect the Conservative government to do the same.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1011850">I can confirm that consular officials have visited Ms. Martin in prison on 15 occasions and have spoken to her by phone over 75 times. Consular officials have also facilitated and will continue to facilitate regular phone contact between Ms. Martin and her family. We have also taken care to ensure that her well-being and health concerns are addressed immediately and we will continue to liaise very closely with Mexican officials in regard to Ms. Martin's case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011851">The Government of Canada made numerous representations on Ms. Martin's case. The <Affiliation DbId="111553" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> has raised this issue with the Mexican Foreign Secretary Espinosa on a number of occasions and just yesterday in Washington, D.C. I am encouraged by the reports coming from the media on her comments that she expects this file to move in a couple of weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011852">Both the <Affiliation DbId="105841" Type="5">Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and International Trade </Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="105839" Type="5">Secretary of State for Multiculturalism and Canadian Identity </Affiliation> have met with senior officials from the Mexican foreign ministry and the attorney general's office during their respective trips to Mexico. At all levels, the Government of Canada has expressed its concerns regarding the length of time Ms. Martin's case has been taking and sought assurances that the case will proceed expeditiously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011853">The member stated that he was in charge of consular affairs. I want to say one little thing for all Canadians on this issue. When people apply for a passport, the Department of Foreign Affairs will issue a booklet titled “Bon Voyage, But...”, which is handed out with every new Canadian passport. The booklet explains quite clearly what Canadians who travel overseas can expect from the Government of Canada as far as consular cases are concerned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011854">One of the most important issues mentioned in that publication is that when Canadians are arrested outside of Canada, they are subject to the laws and regulations of the host country. My hon. colleague is well aware of that issue. The Government of Canada cannot influence the judicial process of a sovereign country, just as we would not allow another country to attempt to influence our judicial process. We must always work within the judicial system of the country in question and find the means to assist Canadian citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011855">As the hon. member knows, we make every attempt to come to a consensus and to work with the government in question to ensure that the interests of Canadians who find themselves in difficulties are taken into account. We will provide consular services, access to lawyers and we will do anything in our power to ensure their rights are maintained. However, Canadians must always remember that when they are travelling overseas in a sovereign country, the rules of that country apply first.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011856">In Brenda Martin's case, we are working with the Mexican authorities. He himself has visited and applied pressure. We are very hopeful after hearing the latest comments by the secretary of foreign affairs for Mexico who stated that the case is expected to move ahead in the next two weeks.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1011857">Mr. Speaker, we are hopeful that we will have a positive outcome and, should she be found guilty under the system, that the transfer of offender treaty will in fact apply to her and she will be able to come home immediately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011858">Let us be very clear. There are hundreds of cases out there where we do apply and recognize that the judiciary of another country is paramount. Canada is not to interfere, nor does it propose to. However, in the case of Brenda Martin, by all evidence, the laws that apply to Mexico and the obligations Mexico has under international treaty, including the international treaty and convention on civil political rights, were not upheld and were not in force. That is why this member and the Liberal Party went to bat for Brenda Martin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011859">We believe it is important that, while Canada has obligations to respect other countries, other countries have an obligation to respect our nationals when they are in their country as well, as they would expect of us when it comes to their nationals being here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1011860">I am pleased to see the hon. member is on the file. I am hoping that there may be a change in the next couple of weeks. I understand he is very interested in these cases. I look forward to more cases down the road behind the scenes so we can resolve these problems before they are gone. When the opposition raises this, it is for a good reason.</ParaText>
