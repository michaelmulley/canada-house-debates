            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1067832">I am now prepared to rule on the point of order raised by the <Affiliation DbId="105838" Type="96">government House leader and minister for democratic reform </Affiliation>on April 8, 2008 concerning the requirement for a royal recommendation for Bill <Document DbId="3073383" Type="4">C-445, An Act to amend the Income Tax Act (tax credit for loss of retirement income)</Document> standing in the name of the member for <Affiliation DbId="78421" Type="2">Richmond-Arthabaska</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067833">I would like to thank the hon. <Affiliation DbId="105836" Type="4">government House leader</Affiliation> as well as the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78421" Type="2">Richmond--Arthabaska</Affiliation> for their contributions on this issue.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1067834">In his intervention, the hon. government House leader stated that refundable tax credits are direct benefits paid to individuals regardless of whether tax is owed or not and are paid out of the consolidated revenue fund. He argued that a legislative proposal creating such a tax credit therefore needed to be accompanied by a royal recommendation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067835">In support of his argument, he pointed to a Speaker's ruling of June 4, 2007, which did not select a report stage amendment to Bill <Document DbId="2801101" Type="3">C-52</Document>, the Budget Implementation Act, 2007, that sought to create a refundable tax credit because it required a royal recommendation. He also referred to a ruling of May 11, 2006 from the Speaker of the Senate that ruled out of order Bill S-212, an Act to amend the Income Tax Act (tax relief) on the basis that it increased a refundable tax credit.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1067836">In response, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78421" Type="2">Richmond--Arthabaska</Affiliation> argued that legislation proposing a reduction in taxes has always been permitted under our parliamentary rules, even if this leads to reimbursements being made to taxpayers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067837">To support his arguments, he pointed to a ruling by Mr. Speaker Parent of October 16, 1995 regarding Bill S-9, An Act to amend the Canada-United States Tax Convention Act, 1984. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1067838">The Chair has carefully reviewed Bill <Document DbId="3073383" Type="4">C-445</Document>, the previous rulings that were cited as well as the comments from the hon. members and believes that the central issue in the present case is whether the creation of the tax credit found in Bill C-445 is strictly an alleviation of taxation or an authorization to spend for a new and distinct purpose. If it is the latter, the bill would need to be accompanied by a royal recommendation before the third reading motion can be proposed to the House.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1067839">The bill standing in the name of the hon. member of <Affiliation DbId="78421" Type="2">Richmond--Arthabaska</Affiliation> seeks to amend the Income Tax Act by providing for a tax credit to a taxpayer in respect of whom an employer and the employees failed to make required registered pension plan contributions. Whether or not the tax credit is refundable or non-refundable is the key issue in determining the need for a royal recommendation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="05">(1005)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1067840">Non-refundable credits are deducted from a person's tax payable rather than being calculated separately: they simply reduce the amount of tax payable by an individual. The amount of the credit is limited to the amount of the tax payable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067841">This is not the case for refundable tax credits, which are unique in the Income Tax Act: they provide for a taxpayer to receive an amount from the government due to a low amount of taxable income and tax payable. Such credits are calculated separately on an income tax return because they are not simply alleviations of taxes otherwise payable.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1067842">Bill <Document DbId="3073383" Type="4">C-445</Document> is proposing a refundable tax credit. The Chair is of the opinion that the bill would not only alleviate taxation but also potentially allow monies to be disbursed from the consolidated revenue fund, in the event the taxpayer had taxable income for the year that yielded taxes less than the amount of the credit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067843">The circumstances of Bill <Document DbId="3073383" Type="4">C-445</Document> are quite different from those referred by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78421" Type="2">Richmond--Arthabaska</Affiliation> in the ruling concerning Bill S-9. There, reimbursements were limited to tax payable. By making a tax credit refundable, Bill <Document DbId="3073383" Type="4">C-445</Document> could lead to refunds that are greater than taxes paid. Such spending, for a new and distinct purpose, would need to be accompanied by a royal recommendation. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1067844">Accordingly, the Chair will decline to put the question on third reading of this bill in its present form unless a royal recommendation is received. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067845">The debate, later today or on Monday, is currently on the motion for second reading and, as usual, this motion will be put to a vote at the close of the second reading debate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067846">I thank the hon. <Affiliation DbId="105838" Type="96">government House leader</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="78421" Type="2">Richmond—Arthabaska</Affiliation> for their comments on this matter.</ParaText>

              <ProceduralText TocType="TPC" id="1">Bill C-33. Third reading</ProceduralText>
              <ParaText id="1067847"> moved that Bill <Document DbId="3159092" Type="3">C-33, An Act to amend the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999</Document>, be read the third time and passed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067848"> He said: Mr. Speaker, I cannot tell the House what a pleasure and an honour it is to stand and speak to the third reading phase of Bill <Document DbId="3159092" Type="3">C-33</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067849">As everyone knows, there has been quite a bit of controversy around this bill in the days leading up to this particular juncture in the passage of Bill <Document DbId="3159092" Type="3">C-33</Document>. And it will pass. I would like to thank my colleagues from the Liberal Party and the Bloc for taking this legislation under consideration and moving it ahead. It shows real leadership by a government that in the face of a lot of adverse media and so on moved ahead with the right thing at the right time. I give those members a lot of credit for that. Of course the fourth party is leading a different parade, and I welcome it to that, because that is what it does best.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067850">This is a tremendous opportunity. It has been a long road to get here. No one thought when we brought it in that this type of bill would face this kind of adversity, because all of us aggressively campaigned on this issue throughout past elections. Elections come around more quickly in minority situations, but in 2004 and 2006 every party campaigned aggressively on a biofuel strategy. Since we are in government now, Canadians obviously judged our strategy to be the most practical.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067851">The other parties, including the NDP, said they wanted 10% ethanol. We are at 5% ethanol and 2% biodiesel, and I think that in this time and place that is the right quantity. We are moving ahead fairly aggressively on this. Ethanol and biodiesel plants have come into being across the country. This is a great opportunity for farmers to move ahead and to have a different warehouse door to deliver to. More than that, this is great for rural communities that are looking for some sort of renewal after many years of seeing urbanization across this country, whatever was driving it. However, I will not get into that today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067852">Addressing the environment is at the forefront of everybody's mind. As I said, all parties called for a renewable fuel mandate and based it on two things: ethanol is a clean-burning fuel and fossil fuels are not going to last forever. It is time to get serious, especially here in Canada, where we have the capacity to make these changes. It is time to get serious about moving to greener technology. It is all part of what is best for the environment as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067853">This legislation is probably one of the best policies to come forward in the last decade. It is actually a bedrock principle: it is good for the Canadian economy, good for Canadian farmers, and of course it is great news for the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067854">There are a lot of studies at cross purposes out there. Most of them are based on a global model, which we are not talking about here today. We are talking about Canadian production and Canadian policy and that is what this government has to answer to. We cannot begin to analyze and ascertain the directions other countries are taking, but we have to speak to the Canadian electorate, the Canadian people, about why we are doing what we are doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067855">There is good news out there. Due to the innovation and industriousness of Canadian agriculture and Canadian forestry, we have the capacity to do this and in no way affect our food lines. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067856">A lot of people say that we cannot do both. They say we cannot grow food for energy and for consumption. Nothing could be further from the truth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067857"> Anyone who has analyzed food production in this country knows that we are growing more, that it is better quality, and that it is safer. It is time that we started using that great renewable resource to create energy that is great for the environment and also starts to backstop a lot of what farmers were not able to get out of the food line fully to address their bank lines. This legislation is going to do that. We have already seen some effect of that positive side. Again, as I said, it is due to the innovation and so on that is out there. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067858">Things are changing as we speak. Going to our 5% mandate, which is three billion litres of ethanol over the next few years, is the equivalent of taking a million cars off the road, which is a fantastic story in and of itself, but it also takes less than 5% of our capacity to grow these products. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067859">Anyone who is familiar with farm production will tell us that in any given year the weather is a far bigger factor than 5%. There have been instances of floods or droughts, or it just plain does not rain at the right time, and that can cut a crop in half. That is 50%. That is another zero in there.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1067860">We are talking about 5% of our land mass being used for this production. With the industry and the innovation that we have out there, we can probably go further than the three billion litres on that type of land mass. We have new types and new varieties coming in with higher starch values in corn and wheat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067861"> We are also spending a lot of money on moving ahead to the next generation of biofuels. For that next generation, the common phrase is cellulosic. What this entails is that we slip into the forestry side. We start to make use of logs and lumber not suitable for building. We start putting them into the ethanol system using a catalyst and using the innovation that is out there now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067862"> A company called Iogen is actually using this. The member for <Affiliation DbId="78527" Type="2">Ottawa South</Affiliation> is making muscles here, not very big ones, but he says that Iogen is in his riding and he is quite proud of it. I would imagine that he has had some great discussions with Jeff Passmore, the president of Iogen. Jeff is actually getting the final go-ahead to build a huge facility that will produce in the neighbourhood of 400 to 500 million litres of ethanol in my home province of Saskatchewan. The member for <Affiliation DbId="78527" Type="2">Ottawa South</Affiliation> and I will have something in common, finally, and it will be Iogen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067863"> We are looking forward to that. Iogen is going to use straw, wood chips from the Prince Albert pulp mill and different things like that to create that quantity of ethanol. That is a good news story. In the days to come, we will develop that technology, get it to a commercial status and move forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067864">I had a discussion with Jeff Passmore a couple of weeks ago now. I ran into him at a function and we talked about it. He is very excited about the move to Saskatchewan. He is very excited about the potential and the capacity of Saskatchewan farmers to deliver the feedstocks to his plant. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067865">So am I, because the majority of Canadians, some 74% or 75% in the latest poll, are very much behind this government in moving ahead on ethanol and biodiesel. Those are big numbers. What they are asking for, and there is no pun intended, is a homegrown solution to our energy situation, to our preponderance of fossil fuels, and they are asking for our exciting new developments to get hold of the environment and start turning things around. That is what they are driving for. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067866">As I said, our mandate is 5% ethanol and 2% biodiesel, which is coming in the next years. The auto sector has taken up the challenge. That sector is now building vehicles that will burn up to 85% ethanol. That little conversion on the assembly lines means a one hundred dollar bill: that can almost be made back in the first month of driving that an average Canadian does. It will actually pay for that $100 plus take charge of the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067867">For the life of me I cannot understand why certain parties and certain groups would not recognize the overall benefit this is going to create for Canadians and of course around the globe. They seem to be stuck in their ideology and cannot get past it. What is required in times like these, when there is adversity and almost media hysteria, as we see in the headlines, is leadership. Leadership is what is required, from people who will forge ahead, who will continue to do the right thing at the right time for the right reasons and who will not bend to that kind of pressure coming from the ignorant masses and the people out there who do not understand the benefit of what this can do. I see a lot of head-shaking and nodding over there from the Liberal side, and they totally agree with me on that statement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067868">As a government we are concerned about poverty. We are concerned about hunger in the world. We had some great announcements the other day from my colleague, the minister in charge of CIDA. She made a great announcement that Canada continues to be number two in the world on getting those foodstuffs out globally to the poor and the hungry. We have tremendous domestic programs here that address this type of thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067869">People from the United Nations are spearheading a lot of this. A lot of what they say I do not agree with, because it is not based on anything that I would call sound thinking, but they also say that there is enough food produced in the world to feed everybody. The problem is that we cannot get it to where we need it in a timely way, because it is all “best before” products. There is not the processing on the ground in some of these communities to make use of and keep fresh the wheat or meat that is delivered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067870">We have to be more thoughtful in our approach. I think the minister really batted it out of the park by untying our food aid. It has been talked about for a number of years. She finally got the job done. I am proud to stand with her in moving ahead on that issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067871">That comes to grips with the timeliness of delivery. It comes to grips with the transportation costs to get that product there. In most instances, there is no port or infrastructure system capable of handling those boatloads of food aid when they arrive. A lot of it spoils on the dock, some of it because of infrastructure and some of it because of a governance system in the affected country that would trade that food for guns rather than distribute it to the people. People who are poor and hungry are much easier to lead when they are kept out there in the boondocks away from the real action where the changes can be made.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1067872">There is a lot work to be done to feed the poor, the hungry, and those in poverty situations in the world, but a lot of it comes as a result of good governance and infrastructure, as well as the delivery of that. I think that Canada has proven that we always punch above our weight on those issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067873">When we did make the announcement of another $50 million into that food aid program, a lot of people stood up, screamed and hollered that it was not enough. The UN was calling for a 26% increase from all of the contributing nations and we actually came in at 28%, plus we are giving money to the non-governmental organizations like the Foodgrains Bank. It does a tremendous amount of work around the world with donations from farmers. We pay the transportation as the government. There is some processing involved and they get it to where it should go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067874">We have the Mennonite system working around the world with their different relief programs, whether it is flood, famine, plague or pestilence, whatever happens. The Mennonites are there helping out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067875">Our tax system also builds in aid that is not considered under the UN envelope in the same way. We want a homegrown solution and we are a resource rich country. Nobody can deny that, whether we are talking about fresh water stocks, oil and gas or the tar sands in Alberta that are taking a bad rap right now, some of it justified, a lot of it not, but at the same time we have to start moving away from our dependence on fossil fuels. Even the big petroleum companies say that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067876">One of the largest ethanol producers in western Canada at this point is a company called Husky Oil. It is basically owned by a gentleman from Hong Kong, but he has a facility tied to the upgrader in my riding at Lloydminster that is producing several hundred million litres of ethanol. Husky Oil is having trouble getting product because farmers are growing what they can but the weather last year around the Lloydminster area did not let us get those crops off like we should have. That was more of a problem than it should have been. With technology and innovation we are starting to move to crops that are a little more easy to farm and will give farmers better results. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067877">I know the <Affiliation DbId="78751" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> was out to make an announcement in Minnedosa the other day, talking about our regulations and how that would help to start the blending of that product. Husky has bought a company called Mohawk. I remember as a young guy when gas was two bits, 30¢ and 40¢ a gallon, not a litre. That was before the former prime minister decided to make things metric. At those kind of prices per gallon it sounds really cheap but at the time I was making 90¢ an hour, so it is all relative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067878">They used to put an ethanol blend into their products some 25 or 30 years ago and I am giving away my age when I say that but that is the reality. This type of product has been around for a long time. It is finally coming to the fore, that with these regulations passed in Bill <Document DbId="3159092" Type="3">C-33</Document> we will see, mixed right at the refinery and brought to the pump, that minimum 5% blend. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067879">I have seen pumps, Mr. Speaker, in your home town when I was coming back the other day. I stopped in Kingston to have a great meal downtown on the waterfront. I asked how well you were doing. They all said they loved the guy but he should come home more. We also stopped for fuel. I note that the Liberals over there are saying, “Mr. Speaker, you should not go home because you might not get elected”, but I am not sure about that one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067880">We fuelled up. I cannot remember the name of the station but it was a 10% blend. That is good news. Kingston is on the leading edge of ethanol and I praise you for that, Mr. Speaker. I know you have made that issue one of your own.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067881">When we see the price of oil over that same timeframe jump from $20 a barrel to approaching $120 a barrel, it makes this type of economic activity more viable. We have a lot of work being done on new ways to produce ethanol. We have lots of work being done on biodiesel which is another huge success story. We as a government have taken on pilot projects to use rendered products from animals, the byproducts from restaurants, the leftover oils and greases and so on that of course we do not want in our food anymore. We are running them back through biodiesel. It is a tremendous opportunity to build environmental products around that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067882">There are a number of situations that have arisen that have driven up the cost in the food chain and a lot of those can be based strictly on transportation because our product does not move from the farm right to the processor. It goes through middlemen. There are a lot of different things that go on and when we seen increases in transportation costs that are doubling, tripling and so forth, because of fossil fuel and our addiction to it, the problems begin to arise where everyone takes a chunk of the pie. I will use round numbers.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1067883">When we see a $3.00 loaf of bread, and I hear the bread processors saying they have to raise the price again because the cost of wheat is going up, it is ridiculous to the extreme because the farmer on that $3.00 loaf of bread is getting 15¢. That is the cheapest part of that loaf of bread. The damn wrapper with the labelling on it is worth more; or the darn wrapper, sorry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067884">That is the reality. That is the situation that farmers have always faced. So, if the price of bread went to 20%, that is a 33% increase, if my math is still good. That is a huge increase for farmers. Is that nickel going to affect that $3.00 loaf of bread? It should not. I would think it should not, but the costs of transportation of course are exaggerating the reality of what is going on out there. This is another good reason to move ahead with biofuels where we can start to have a renewable resource that is friendly to the environment and of course much easier to maintain the costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067885">We should be looking at ways to make our agricultural processes even more innovative. We are doing that with a little thing called the removal of KVD in western Canada. Saskatchewan alone has 47 million acres of arable land. That is a big number. We run big operations and run big equipment to do it, and of course the overhead costs are all commensurate with the price, so we have seen the price of wheat going up. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067886">We have also seen huge increases in fossil-based fertilizer fuel chemicals. All those types of things are also ramping up as well, so we are pushing a bubble where farmers are starting to make a little more money, but it is also costing a lot more money to make that, so we have to start addressing that and I think biofuels are a great way to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067887">There are opportunities out there now where people can buy a unit that they can actually put on their farms and make their own biodiesel. I talked to a neighbour of mine the other day and he was getting ready to start seeding, and then of course global warming kicked in and we got another 15 inches of snow. That slowed him down a little, but he had gone to town to fuel up his tractor because the roads were too muddy to have the truck come out, so he drove his tractor and it cost him $1,000 to fill it up. The way we farm out there, that lasted about 12 hours, less than a day's shift.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067888">When we look at the young fellow who seeds my ground now, who farms 24,000 acres, he will run 14 or 15 hard days like that with four and five outfits, so he has $5,000 in fuel per day, plus the seed, plus the chemical, plus the fertilizer, plus the manpower, plus the overhead of the equipment and taxes on the land, and all that kind of stuff. Those are the economies of scale we are looking at.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067889">Farmers start to look at the skid units that will actually produce biofuel out of their own canola. There are models like that out there now and it is a great opportunity for these guys to take some canola from their own production, run it through and create their own biofuel, but it does make more sense to do it on economies of scale at larger facilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067890">I have always been a proponent of a number of smaller capacity units scattered throughout a province as opposed to one or two big ones. The problem with one or two big ones is the product has to move. The trucking beats up the road and it starts to defeat the whole process, so smaller and locally owned is the right way to go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067891">I am very fortunate to have in my riding, almost in the centre of my riding, a little town called Unity. There is a North West Terminal there that is owned by farmers. It is a huge success story. It is relatively new on the scene, but in the time that it has been around, some 10 or 15 years since the drawing board, it has doubled in capacity in the grain it has handled. It is now building a 25 million litre ethanol facility next door to the terminal, so as the grain is delivered in, it can slide some of it off to make ethanol right there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067892">As well there is another innovation. A fellow named Mervin Slater has been the push behind this, and I give a lot of credit to Jason Skinner and the crew out there at North West Terminal for their foresight and their vision, and the guys that were on that committee. Merv dropped in to see me when he was in Ottawa. He was on his way to Germany to look at technology that brings about 10% or 15% chaff in with the wheat. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067893">Chaff cannot be hauled. It is like hauling potato chips or ping-pong balls. There is no weight and one cannot get enough on a truck, but when 10% or 15% chaff is brought in with the grain product, it virtually costs nothing. They are using that as the feed stock to fire the turbines to create the ethanol, then they recapture the heat and use it. It is a tremendously integrated system and I give them a lot of credit for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067894">They have not put out a litre of ethanol. They are already looking at the potential and saying it is time to think about expanding the plant already, and that is great news for the farmers of Unity, great news for Canadians, and great news for the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067895">However, we have so many other potentials out there to make great quality ethanol. We have just a tremendous opportunity to show the world this can be done and not affect the food line. There are just any number of ways to point to this and say this is the right thing as we advance forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067896">As I said in my speech, it is basic economics. There are so many things that we will gain from these different lines that will be created. There are offshoots from ethanol: the distiller's grain that goes back into livestock feed, the slurry, and the water. Everything that is used is captured and used as protein base for livestock feed.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1067897">It is not a zero sum gain. There are benefits from all the differing aspects of ethanol and biodiesel as it goes back into livestock feed. There is a loss of 20% or so but we will make that up. It will be good for the communities, good for the farmers, and good for the environment.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1067898">Mr. Speaker, I want to start by saying that I am not opposed to biofuel. I understood his remarks but there has been a growing concern, which maybe the minister could address. The concern raised by the public, both in relation to the higher food costs around the world that many have argued has to do with the demand for biofuels but also the incredible cost that it takes to make biofuel and diesel, deals in particular with the fact that biofuel needs fossil fuels in order to be produced. There is also a cost to the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067899">Like I said to the minister, I am not opposed to it and I certainly am in favour of the fact that we are proposing this amendment to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, but there are inefficiencies as well in our society that we have to deal with. The bigger issue may have to do with our high demand for energy consumption. Nothing is being put forward to address these concerns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067900">We have many products in our homes that are not very efficient. We have to look at other mechanisms to deal with the issues of energy within our homes, our society and our workplace. These things also need to be addressed so that consumption can be lowered. If we continue with the high demand for energy consumption, there is going to be more and more demand for energy and it will all have an impact on the environment and our lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067901">I am not opposed to the issue of biofuel and I see that there is a need for it. I understand the increase to the 5% blend, but at the same time I have serious concerns and reservations which have been raised by a number of people and I would like to have the minister address those concerns.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1067902">Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="78983" Type="2">Davenport</Affiliation> for his intervention and for seeking knowledge as to why this is the right thing at the right time. I give him credit for that. I will cover off a couple of things. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067903">He talked about energy and our addiction to it, which I guess is the best way to describe it. I do not think we can push people away from having a light switch that flips on rather than lighting a coal oil lamp. We have lived through that and moved ahead, but there are new and innovative ways coming to the marketplace. There are new light bulbs available that will address energy consumption. Even turning our TVs off still takes power. There are new ways to do that and those will be driven by a different way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067904">We cannot combine all of our energy needs and the misuse of energy under the biofuels banner. A lot of people are using that as the lightning rod and we have to disconnect some of it. There is good news with biofuels but there are costs as well. He mentioned the point that it takes energy to create energy but that is typical of anything. Even if we go back to hydro, it still takes energy to build the dam, so we have to look at the downstream costs in a lot of cases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067905">I see comparisons now that say, “The cost of fossil fuel is $1.20 at the pump for gas“, and then, “Here is ethanol”, but we still have to combine it and plant it. The downstream costs of that gas at the pump are not taken into consideration but they are for biofuels. That is not a true comparison. When comparing apples to apples in the studies that have been done, the real ones, there is a huge benefit to ethanol and a bigger benefit to biodiesel. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067906">We have to start building better technology, there is no doubt about it. There is innovation out there that will let us grow the crop in a more fulsome and cheaper way with zero till, less fertilizer and all those types of things. As we develop new innovative varieties, we will get 80 bushels an acre on dryland farming, which is unheard of now, but we have not been able to do that because of kernel visual distinguishability in western Canada. That is gone. We will move ahead on that front as well. It is a major gain. There are several thrusts, not just biofuel. It becomes the lightning rod and the whipping boy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067907">When he talks about food costs, yes, we are all looking at that. In the latest study in Canada, Statistics Canada said the food basket in Canada actually dropped .2% in February. Our higher dollar is letting us buy better but it is also hurting our trade capacity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067908">We are also seeing emerging countries, and I will list a couple, China, India, Brazil, Mexico, where there is a huge middle class starting to grow. They are moving away from a rice-based diet and saying, “We want meat and potatoes”. We are seeing fast food chains moving there and so on. Whether it is good or bad, they are doing that because this middle class with money is asking for new and innovative foodstuffs. They are tired of a bland rice diet and they need protein, not starch.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067909">I was in Cuba last week on a trade mission. People there are bemoaning the fact that rice has gone from $400 a tonne to $800 a tonne. Now it is approaching $1,200 a tonne and it is still over in the Pacific Rim and has to be transported. I asked why they are not thinking outside the box. I said there are beans, potatoes and meat available in Canada for half those quantity prices and they should start re-jigging their diet to be more healthy. Therefore, there are a lot of changes in the food basket that just cannot be blamed on ethanol.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1067910">Mr. Speaker, it was interesting to hear the <Affiliation DbId="111560" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food</Affiliation> speak again to this subject. The last time he spoke I asked him a question about the relative merits of what he was saying about the greenhouse gas reductions that are engaged with biofuels. He was talking about four megatonnes of reduction that would come from his 5% program in fuel with the $2.2 billion investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067911">A careful scientific analysis by the BIOCAP Canada Foundation shows that with corn ethanol we would get a 21% reduction in CO<Sub>2</Sub> emissions, which is what we would normally get with gasoline if it were bought in Canada. If we buy it from U.S. producers we will have a negative greenhouse gas emissions reduction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067912">With the 21% Canadian, what would happen if we were to make all the corn in Canada and feed it into our ethanol system to produce the 5%? The vehicle fleet in Canada produces 100 megatonnes of CO<Sub>2</Sub> emissions; 5% of 100 megatonnes is 5 megatonnes and 20% of 5 megatonnes is much less than 4 megatonnes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067913">Why does the minister keep using these figures when he obviously has the same kinds of studies that we are working from? If he has some study that shows that he is getting 4 megatonnes of reduction from his program, costing Canadian taxpayers $2.2 billion, he should put it on the line.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067914">The minister keeps referring to the idealistic opposition to not simply blindly moving ahead but carefully considering what we are doing with biofuels, that includes such idealistic lefties as Terence Corcoran, Don Martin and Gwyn Morgan who are all part of the NDP and are idealistic soulmates.

              <ParaText id="1067924">Mr. Speaker, I listened intently to the minister's remarks this morning and I thank him for speaking extemporaneously without notes, which is good to hear. I will try to imitate his style and respond directly to some of the issues that he raised.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067925">I do not think the minister should take too much comfort in the support that he received from this party yesterday in allowing Bill <Document DbId="3159092" Type="3">C-33</Document> to proceed because we treat this bill merely as a technical amendment to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act which would allow the existing minister or any future minister to regulate the content of ethanol in fuels for consumption in Canada and for fuels to be exported abroad. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067926">However, let me assure the minister and the government that there are very profound questions that they have not even begun to answer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067927">Chief among those questions is why, in the first instance, was this bill put to the House by the <Affiliation DbId="111560" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture</Affiliation> when it is an Environment Canada bill? It is the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, separated and driven by the <Affiliation DbId="105835" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation>. I understand the government's intention here, which is to strategically place this as a farm receipts issue, which it, of course, partly is, but overarching the farm receipts issue, in fact overarching so many issues in Canadian society, are more profound issues and concerns about where we are going with our environmental policy. My remarks today will be cast with that chiefly in mind. How is the government proceeding here with this bill? How is it proceeding in the ethanol field when it comes to environmental perspectives? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067928">However, I first want to talk about the very recent about-face taken by the NDP, which I will not descend to in terms of the remarks made by the <Affiliation DbId="111560" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture</Affiliation>, but I do want to express my disappointment in the NDP in its attempts to politicize food prices, in its attempts to try to, in my view, frighten Canadians with its food for fuel campaign. It is much more constructive if we actually pursue a rational debate about the drivers, the factors that are at play not just in Canada but globally. Factors, for example, like oil prices have jumped by nearly 100% over the past year; that in 2007 food prices increased by about 4% overall; that 80% of the cost of food today are food marketing costs. The marketing costs are the difference between the farm value and consumer spending for food at grocery stores and restaurants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067929">The price of rice is now up 77% since October. Rice is not used in the production of biofuels. As a whole, fish prices are up, not just in Canada but worldwide. Why? In part it is because we are seeing five of the six major oceans fisheries in a state of collapse today. We hear nothing from the government about that. Why is this important? It is important because the government's ethanol policy appears to be completely disconnected from its environmental policy. That is a shame because the two are inextricably linked. They need to be presented as such and they need to be defended as such. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067930">I will turn for a moment to two amendments put forward by the NDP that the Canadian public is not aware of and that were ruled out of order by this House. This speaks volumes to the tone and the approach the NDP members are taking to this debate, which is simply not helpful. Two other amendments they have put to this House include the prohibition of the use of genetically modified organisms for biofuel production. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067931">My understanding of this sector is that if we were to rule out the use of GMO crops, we might as well shut down the entire industry as we speak. For that matter, as an agricultural graduate, I can assure Canadians that most of the foods and the grains that we are eating are and have been improved through the use of science over the past decades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067932"> Second, the NDP wanted to establish restrictions on the use of arable land. I put to the environment critic of the NDP some time ago whether the leader of the NDP would soon announce his intention to nationalize Canadian farms. We have seen that around the world and, as a person who has had the privilege of working around the world, I do not think there are any remaining jurisdictions that seriously believe that such nationalization will help us with our food production patterns.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="40">(1040)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1067933">I will now turn to some of the key issues around the bill. First, as we have said repeatedly, we are in favour of ethanol as a part of our energy mix now and into the future. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067934">There is an industry that exists today. Ethanol is a transition fuel, one of the transition fuels to our carbon constrained future. Why is it a choice transition fuel right now, in the right amounts? It is partly because the infrastructure for ethanol distribution already exists. We have all of the sunk capital costs spent in the way in which we dispense gasoline and other fuels, and ethanol fits into that distribution system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067935">For example, when we talk about the eventual quantum leap, perhaps to a hydrogen based economy, our challenge will be how we distribute the hydrogen and safely. However, right now, as a transition fuel, ethanol can be used and blended. Every car on the road today with an owner's manual can burn up to 10% ethanol, as we speak. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067936">As I say, it is a technical amendment bill and, in that sense, it is important. We need to give a minister the powers necessary to regulate fuel content.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067937">However, more important, there remains a plethora of questions that the government has not even begun to address. Having just heard the <Affiliation DbId="111560" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food</Affiliation>, I was waiting with anticipation to hear him speak to the connection between the Conservatives' fiscal policies on this issue, their agricultural policies on this issue and their environmental policies on this issue. Lo and behold, I waited too long because he never addressed them. He did not address the environmental implications of this issue at all, which is unfortunate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067938">We think it is important, as we agreed in committee when the bill was debated, that one year after the bill comes into full force and effect and becomes a law, it will go back to a parliamentary committee and then and there it will be the subject of a major detailed analysis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067939">The ethanol industry should be examined much more fulsomely. We need to address questions like energy inputs, chemical inputs and meaningful greenhouse gas reductions and whether we are achieving these. We need to address the impacts on food pricing, trade considerations, agricultural land use patterns both here and abroad, freshwater impacts, agricultural run-offs, farm receipts and soil impacts. The most precious resource that most farmers possess is the top three inches of their soil. There are so many other issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067940">One year after the bill becomes law, we will hold the government to account and we will be asking for a detailed analysis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067941">The government has not developed the metrics necessary. In that sense, I commend the NDP for raising this issue, as well as the Bloc. The government has not developed the metrics necessary to tell Canadians clearly why we are choosing ethanol over other transition fuels or, for that matter, why one form of ethanol is more beneficial than others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067942">It is true that cellulosic ethanol allows us to make a quantum leap, to take us to a second or even third generation form of ethanol, which burns more cleanly and, for that matter, puts more marginal lands into production.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067943">Thirty years ago, as a young agricultural student I remember surveying all of eastern Ontario for a potential project to plant all kinds of new varieties and species of poplar. Poplar, which grows very quickly, could be grown on very marginal lands and can be put into cellulosic ethanol form over time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067944">Now that we do have the engineering and the chemistry to produce the enzymes required to convert such feed stocks into cellulosic ethanol, we can have a very meaningful debate in a year's time in terms of more details.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067945">Many factors are at play, and the minister has pointed to a few but has omitted others, to create this perfect global storm right now that is wreaking havoc in developing countries, emerging economies when it comes to food pricing and food access. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="45">(1045)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1067946">Yes, it is true that ethanol production in northern jurisdictions is having an impact. The question is, to what extent is it having an impact? So many other forces are at play, forces like decertification, climate change, weather patterns, energy costs, trade rules, subsidies. Forty per cent of the European Union's budget is the common agricultural policy to subsidize the production of agricultural products. This is a question that is affecting food prices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067947">Food distribution systems, corruption levels, the rule of law, the extent to which we are seeing rising Asian incomes and a propensity to consume more protein, the Australian drought, which is lingering as a result of climate change, all affect food prices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067948">I was quite shocked to hear the <Affiliation DbId="111560" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture</Affiliation> make light of climate change, suggesting that cold weather recently in Saskatchewan clearly indicated that the planet was not warming, but must be cooling. This is tantamount to what we heard from the <Affiliation DbId="78755" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation>, before he erased it from his website, when he made light of the fact that B.C.'s climate was warming so he was suggesting buying vast amounts of land in northern B.C. and flipping it for profit. That is not funny. It portrays the government's profound non-commitment to the climate change crisis facing Canada and the planet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067949">Many factors are at play, creating the perfect storm. Unfortunately now we are seeing nation states moving to nationalize and to hoard food stocks. This is very problematic. This is having a direct bearing on global food prices and global food distribution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067950">In short, when it comes to the question of where the government goes with its ethanol policy, we have a profound responsibility on this side of the House, as the official opposition, to hold the government to account, and we intend to do so. The government has announced it is spending $2.2 billion in this field. We will watch closely as to how it invests this $2.2 billion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067951">It is very strange also because the government's <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> stands up in public fora after public fora and announces to the world that he does not pick winners and losers. It is this neo-con, laissez-faire, “I don't care” voodoo economics that he professes to practice. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067952">The government now is taking $2.2 billion and ploughing it into a sector. This really raises questions about the government's commitment to this post-post-Conservative approach to economics that I have not seen another country in the world practice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067953">There are a number of important questions to raise about the science around ethanol and greenhouse gas reductions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067954">What is the net environmental impact of ethanol use? It depends very much on the raw materials used and the production process used. Has the government spoken to this? Not at all. Is it in the bill? Not at all. Have any studies been tabled? Nothing. Has any evidence been put forward to suggest that the government is meaningfully going to take us to second, third and fourth generation technologies? We have not seen it, but we will be watching for it. In a year, when we perform a detailed analysis on this question, we will be looking for answers to this question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067955">We hear a lot about corn ethanol. There are mixed studies. Berkley's studies find that corn ethanol reduces GHG emissions by about 13%. We are hearing contrary studies. Has the government actually reconciled the competing science, peer reviewed it and put it to the Canadian people? We have not seen it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067956">We see other studies that show that cellulosic ethanol would produce about 85% fewer greenhouse gases than gasoline. There are now emerging studies and emerging science. How much is the government investing in science? How much of it is evidence based? How much of it is ideologically based? We remain to be convinced. We are looking for that evidence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067957">It is true that new demand for corn to produce ethanol is inflating corn prices. There are distributive impacts that we have to be aware of not just in Canada, but throughout the United States, Mexico, Central America and beyond. The government has to address this question, and we will look for that question to be answered in due course.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067958">Yet again, we know that even marginal increases in grain costs harm poor people the most. They could exacerbate world hunger. Again, I am disappointed in some of the tone, maybe even some of the histrionics coming from the NDP recently on this question. It is important to look at the oft-cited example of the price of tortillas in Mexico, which doubled in 2006, a year of record U.S. corn prices. We know we need to get off corn, because it is such an energy and water intensive, highly polluting crop. Plus, the minister knows the impact of mono-cropping of corn on soil friability on organic matter content. He knows the destructive nature of corn production.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="50">(1050)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1067959">Some are concerned that, for example, the use of E85, 85% ethanol as a motor fuel may lead to increased smog and health effects. Has this been addressed? No. We are waiting to see the analysis put by the government, and we will be holding it to account as it begins to allocate the $2.2 billion into the field.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067960">There is a fear that conversion of forests or wilderness to farmland will not only harm biodiversity, but may negatively affect the net greenhouse gas production because of the role that forests and wilderness play when it comes to sequestering carbon. The government, again, picked another winner. It does not pick winners and losers, but it picked another winner by investing over $200 million in carbon capture and sequestration recently in the home riding of one of the government members, to be able to try to pilot through an important and promising technology. However, is it speaking about the role of nature in sequestering carbon? Not a peep. I do not believe the Conservatives take climate change seriously. I do not think they have reconciled their economic, agricultural and environmental policies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067961">Those are some of the questions that we want to see answered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067962"> Here is another question. At the environmental centre of why nations first began using ethanol, it was to deal with the replacement of lead, as well as reducing the use of benzene, which is the number one petro-carcinogen. The government says that it has a national cancer strategy. We know that the number petro-carcinogen is benzene. If we Google benzene, here is what pops up, “No known safe level”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067963">Then remember that some 400 million litres or 1% of gasoline is benzene. It is present with toluene and xylene, which are also dubious, according to Health Canada's anti-smoking group, and they are in there only for octane purposes. Ethanol has a 113 octane rating, the highest of any fuel. It could be used to replace at least the 1% benzene portion if oil refiners so desired. That is really important when the Canadian Cancer Society now predicts that one in two Canadians will get cancer. One in three Ontarians today will get cancer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067964">Is the government linking its three core policies together? We see no evidence of it, and we are looking for it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067965">Finally, I want to raise the question of the government's fiscal choice on April 1 of this year to repeal the excise tax exemption for biodiesel and ethanol fuels. This is at a time when the ethanol industry is just getting on its feet, and it is let down with the government deciding to remove the excise tax exemption for biodiesel and ethanol fuels. We know that on low level blends, the effect of the repeal on prices in the retail sector is minimum. It is about 0.5¢ per litre on E5 ethanol blends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067966">However, for higher blends, the additional burden is substantial, 2¢ a litre for E50 and 8.5¢ a litre for E85. How does this reconcile with the government's stated purpose to try to increase the ethanol industry in Canada? We have two or three stations in Canada against the 1,200 in the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067967">We will hold the government to account. I suggest the <Affiliation DbId="111560" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="105835" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> sit down and share a cup of coffee and actually try to bring their policies together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1067968"> I cannot understand for the life of me why the government is not placing this and connecting this to a national climate change response. The only thing I conclude, along with the seven objective and third party groups that have looked at the government's climate change plan, is that no one believes it. Nobody believes it will achieve what it sets out to. As a result, I think they are incapable of actually linking these together.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1068262">Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to talk about biofuels because, unlike what has been projected about the New Democratic position, we support a properly managed biofuel programs in this country. What we are trying to do in the House of Commons is to get to a point where we have policies that we can present to the Canadian public and that industry can understand where we are going. We want to be assured that what we are doing is correct and is working in the best interests of Canadians on all the fronts that have been purported to be useful in terms of the development of a biofuel industry in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068263">The comments of the Liberals and Conservatives today and yesterday about our participation in this debate remind me of the old saying: A half truth is like half a brick; one can throw it twice as far and it hurts just as much. That is what they are doing. They are presenting half-truths again. That is not what we want in Parliament. We want to have an honest and structured debate about the relative merits of what we are doing as a Parliament. That is what we are after. That is what we are focused on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068264">This is not an ideological debate. The <Affiliation DbId="111560" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food</Affiliation> claimed in his speech that somehow the ideological forces of the left were driving this debate on biofuels, creating opposition to the Conservatives' implementation of a program in exactly the way they want through a bill that has no conditions attached to it, much as what was indicated by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78527" Type="2">Ottawa South</Affiliation>. After he got over the need to bash away at us, he spoke quite eloquently about all the things that we have been bringing forward in Parliament, all the issues that have not been resolved around biofuels.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068265">When we talk about an ideological bent, we can refer to all the different people who have spoken lately of their concerns about the direction biofuels are taking not only in Canada but around the world. And yes, we do have what we might call a fellow traveller in the Prime Minister of Great Britain whose government over many years promoted biofuels, but who has now said, “We have to go back and look at what we are doing”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068266">New Democrats are always willing to examine what we have proposed to see the merits within it. If we have policies that are not perfect, we adjust them. I can see that too with the Conservatives. They had a policy which was clearly articulated by the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> during the election. He said that the Conservatives were not going to touch income trusts. What did he do when he came to the realization, that we already supported, that these were hurting the economy? He changed his position. We saw the result. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068267">This is a forum. The government must be flexible. We must look at the situation in front of us and do the very best possible for Canadians. The New Democrats are standing up again trying to ensure that the debate is useful and relevant and that we get the consideration we want of the bills in front of us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068268">The biofuels bill is an empty box which the Conservatives can fill with goodies for their friends. They can fill it with policies that will help large corporations. They can fill it with policies that will bring products from other countries that are going to compete with our Canadian farmers. This will create more dislocation and will not give us the kind of environmental return we could get from our own farmers. New Democrats do not trust the Conservative government to do the right thing.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="15">(1215)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1068269">In committee, we were consistent. We brought up conditions that we wanted to see in the bill that would ensure we did the right thing with biofuels. Those were opposed by both the Liberals and the Conservatives. They did, however, give the NDP an amendment to have a review on a two year basis. It is a good idea and it is almost all we needed, but not quite.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068270">A two year review will already assume that the industry is up and running, that it is investing, that farmers are changing their production of different types of agriculture products to match up to the legislation in place. This was not quite enough. With this empty box, we needed to have a review of what the Conservatives would fill the box with before it went out to the public. How is this opposing biofuels? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068271">This is giving some surety to Canadians that where the economy is going is correct. How can this be interpreted except in terms of this half truth? Once again, one can throw it further to try to hurt the others just as much. That is the truth of what has gone on in Parliament to date.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068272">When I heard the member for <Affiliation DbId="78527" Type="2">Ottawa South</Affiliation> talk eloquently about the problems with the biofuel policy in front of us, when he mentioned all the studies that had not been done, when he mentioned all the things that were not in place, why was he then so insistent that we flash forward with this policy when he had all those unanswered questions? Did it have anything to do with the investment that would go to his riding from the $2.2 billion, which are on the table right now as part of the public funds that will be invested in the biofuels industry? I ask the member for <Affiliation DbId="78527" Type="2">Ottawa South</Affiliation> to look into his heart and see whether this is part of his motivation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068273">Right now across northern Canada, and it is not just in the Northwest Territories, it is in Yukon, Nunavut, northern Quebec, Labrador, we are experiencing a massive increase in heating costs and costs of generation with fossil fuels, fuel oil. Fuel oil prices affect hundreds of thousands of people across northern Canada and many rural people in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba. It affects rural people in Ontario, the Maritimes and Quebec who are not attached to a natural gas distribution system and use fuel oil. These costs are going through the roof.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068274">Are there any solutions? There are solutions and we are putting those solutions to work in Yellowknife right now. We are buying biomass products from Alberta and running our larger buildings and many homes on wood pellets. It is easily transportable, cellulosic material that is simply pelletized and provides that opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068275">This can spread right across northern Canada. This could have been available to everybody in the country if there had been one thing, and that was parity in the bioenergy market where the greenhouse gas reductions were compared with biofuels and bioenergy, where values and incentives were based on how much we could return to the different types of objectives that were set into the policy. If that were the case, we could do so much more to reduce the cost of living for people across country who are not attached to a natural gas delivery system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068276">Personally, as a northern resident, although I use biomass myself, I have full sympathy for us in building our bioenergy industry across the country. Yet there is no parity and no discussion of this. Nor is there any discussion of the way to use different forms of energy. We are on a biofuel path that may or may not be appropriate. This does not mean we should preclude the other forms of bioenergy available to us.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1068277">We are investing $500 million in a cellulosic ethanol pilot plant. The BIOCAP study prepared by REAP-Canada, which was presented in the agriculture committee, speaks to cellulosic ethanol quite well. Cellulosic product that could easily be used in thermal capacities has a 39% efficiency in conversion of that energy. In other words, when the bioenergy product is converted into biofuel in a cellulosic ethanol plant, 60% of the energy is lost off the top. Huge capital costs are attached to this as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068278">A typical commercial cellulosic plant, as the one proposed in Idaho, would have an estimated cost of $250 million U.S. to process approximately 68 million litres of cellulosic ethanol each year. That works out to about $175 a gigajoule in investment to return one gigajoule of energy. When we look at other forms of using cellulosic product, for instance, in replacing thermal energy in people's homes, in power generation, we are looking at about $5 a gigajoule investment in the plant. We are creating an industry that stretches right across the country and works for everyone. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068279">These are the types of examples we need to talk about in Parliament. We need legislation that will create a level playing field for bioenergy and biofuels and will ensure that we are putting money into the best things possible for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068280">I am not trying to be a Luddite. I am speaking to the real concerns of Canadians. We are running out of natural gas in our country. National Energy Board projections indicate that we will be a net importer of natural gas by 2020 with all supplies in. This is a crisis, and one perhaps not well articulated by the government because it does not want to go in that direction. It wants us to purchase liquefied natural gas from other countries at exorbitant prices, with no particular economic benefit to our whole economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068281">The opportunities for bioenergy everywhere are great and for biofuel equally great. We need to move ahead with policy that works. I do not see that here. The legislation does not address the issues in front of us. It does not provide significant return to Canadians in terms of greenhouse gas reductions. We invest $2.2 billion to get a couple of megatonnes of reduction. That is $1 billion a megatonne.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068282">Where is the comparative analysis that should have taken place about the kinds of investments the government should make in different forms of subsidies that would go to different things and provide better analysis? These analyses are available. BIOCAP Canada did a complete assessment of that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068283">The greenhouse gas reduction cost for corn ethanol is some $375 per kilogram. Using biomass in pelletized form for either heating or for electrical generation would be a $50 a kilogram cost reduction. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068284">The numbers are just staggering when we think of what we are doing. Why are we doing it? Because a number of people in the other parties have specific interests in the ridings. They see this as an investment to be made right away so they can move this forward in a way that really does not make good policy. It may make good sense in the next election for these people, but in the long term is it really the sense of what we want to do as a responsible member of the international community? I do not think so. </ParaText>

A motion of this type, other than the obvious transparent effort to obstruct and delay, in which we know members are engaging, is not in order if it is a motion that has the impact of providing instructions to the committee on how it should deal with the matter. It is one thing to refer a matter such as this back to the committee for reconsideration, however, the motion goes far beyond that because it says, “to making sure that both economic and environmental effects of introducing these regulations do not cause a negative impact on the environment or unduly influence commodity markets”.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1068297">Ford, for example, in St. Thomas makes a vehicle that is E85 compatible, and there is a number of vehicles around the Hill that are E85, and 85% ethanol is coming to town. In Woodstock in the next week an E85 pump at an independent gas station will bring that to the marketplace. It is going to happen in Burlington. It is going to happen in all urban areas across the country. We need to be on board to be able to produce ethanol domestically to meet the demand of consumers who will want to be more environmentally sensitive in their automobile choices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068298">Does the member not think the NDP's approach on this bill is like putting its head in the sand and not dealing with the issue? The use of biofuels is coming. We can either be a part of it and make a difference and take advantage of it as a Canadian economy, or we can let some other country get ahead of us and do it. Why are the NDP members not embracing the biofuel approach, which the bill would enhance?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1068299">Mr. Speaker, the question really fits very well with what I have been proposing. I wanted to see conditions that would have linked themselves to greenhouse gas emissions for the development of the biofuels industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068300">In other words, we would have some condition that would give a priority to those biofuel production lines, those uses of biological energy, to produce fuel so that the incentives would be tailored to the greenhouse gas reductions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068301">To move to 5% ethanol in our gasoline we are going to have to grow about 4.5 million tonnes of corn or else we are going to buy it from the United States. The studies that are done by BIOCAP Canada, a very respectable study, suggest that corn ethanol from the United States or corn products from the United States actually have a negative greenhouse gas life cycle production. In Canada it is slightly better at 21%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068302">Biodiesel on the other hand from canola is probably the most attractive option when we are talking about the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through the use of a particular product. So when we talk about canola, we are talking about a product that actually does have some of the characteristics that we are looking for in a product. We can see a net offset of CO<Sub>2</Sub> of 57%. That is reasonable but it is still not as good as perhaps using bioenergy simply as a heating product where we are going to get a greenhouse gas reduction closer to 90% to 95%. Those are good numbers. Those are really solid numbers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068303">Therefore, when we think of the bioenergy industry, yes, we should think of it in terms of greenhouse gas reductions and we should be very careful about what we are doing with it so that we do achieve the goals that we have, and we do move ourselves toward Kyoto compliance.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1068336">I am pleased to participate once again in the debate on Bill <Document DbId="3159092" Type="3">C-33, An Act to amend the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999</Document>. I have already made two or three speeches on this subject. To avoid repeating what I have said, I will focus in this speech on the need to reduce our dependency on oil, which obviously also has to do with the use of biofuels.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068337">The bill itself does not contain any standards. It authorizes the government to adopt regulations, which is basically how biofuels would be monitored, with respect to standards and their impact. In the medium term, this bill can help us reduce our dependency on oil and significantly decrease greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles, depending on the type of biofuel used and, of course, the type of transportation used with these biofuels.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068338">The vast majority of greenhouse gas emissions are produced when petroleum products are burned. To reduce these emissions and fight climate change, naturally, we also have to reduce our oil consumption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068339">Of course, Bill <Document DbId="3159092" Type="3">C-33</Document> is not a binding instrument for reducing greenhouse gas emissions; it is a measure to promote the development of alternative fuels. The best instrument for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and the only binding one, is the Kyoto protocol, which the Conservative government unfortunately rejected out of hand. Instead, this government is helping the oil companies, which have responded with a price at the pump that is close to $1.40 in the Montreal area. The other day, I saw $1.37. A litre of regular gasoline is selling for nearly $1.50.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068340">In Canada, the oil companies, which recently again announced profits in the billions of dollars, pay less tax than in Texas. When we see that, we wonder what this government's real intentions and real priorities are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068341">Between 1970 and 2000, the hydrocarbon industry received $66 billion in direct subsidies from the federal government. For your information, Quebec developed hydroelectricity all on its own, without the federal government's help. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068342">The Bloc Québécois suggests that the government stop giving special treatment to the oil industry, which has no need of government tax breaks. It is not a matter of shutting down the oil industry. We all understand that we need oil, but the idea behind this sort of policy or concern is to stop giving tax breaks to companies that do not need them in the least.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068343">I have a few figures that prove this. Petro-Canada's net profit for the first quarter of this year was $1.1 billion, an 82% increase over the same period last year. This is no laughing matter. In 2007, Shell, the second-largest oil company in the world, had a net profit of over $30 billion. A net profit of more than $30 billion for a single oil company, even one that operates all over the world, is quite something.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068344">Instead of helping the oil industry, the federal government needs to levy a surtax on oil extraction and production industry profits. The revenues from this surtax should go toward measures to promote reduced consumption of petroleum products. This would be a smart policy if we really want to reduce our oil use.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068345">One of the ways we could be less dependent on oil is by improving energy efficiency and using cleaner modes of transportation to move goods. Take trains and ships for example—these two types of transportation account for 8% of oil consumption, compared to trucks, which account for 92%. This is an absolutely incredible difference. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1068346">The benefits of increasing our use of trains and ships include reducing our consumption of oil products and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which we will come back to. What is more, when we take greater advantage of our seaways and rail system, we scale down traffic by reducing the number of trucks. We have all been stuck in traffic. I am not saying that the problem will be fixed immediately, but cutting down on the use of trucks will certainly improve the situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068347">We must also move away from fuel oil and favour cleaner energy sources, for individuals as well as businesses. We have been looking at all kinds of alternative fuels and alternative energy sources. Now we must promote the use of these products in order to keep reducing our use of fuel oil, a serious pollutant. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068348">In Parliament, the Bloc Québécois is actively trying to minimize the impact of the rising price of gasoline. This is not the first time we have done so. We are once again on the attack. For instance, this week, we moved forward with deliberations at second reading of Bill <Document DbId="3076433" Type="4">C-454</Document>, introduced by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78475" Type="2">Montcalm</Affiliation>. The bill made its way to second reading this week and was the topic of debate. The bill aims to give greater powers to the Competition Bureau.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068349">I would also like to touch briefly on the objective of Bill <Document DbId="3076433" Type="4">C-454</Document>. It is absolutely crucial that the government strengthen the Competition Act in order to better combat the exorbitant increases in gas prices that average Canadians must face every time they fill up. To achieve this, the government must give greater powers to the Competition Bureau so that it may conduct a real investigation, particularly of the refining sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068350">At present, the Competition Bureau does not have the power to launch an investigation on its own initiative. The legislation must therefore be changed. When it does conduct a review, its mandate does not allow it to discipline the industry, but simply to determine how it generally operates. Furthermore, it cannot force the disclosure of documents or protect witnesses during such a review. Thus, clearly, it is very broad and above all very fluid. This does not impose many restrictions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068351">In short, the Competition Bureau has its hands tied and is in no position to fight the oil companies, which are unscrupulously fleecing consumers. I have more examples. Profit margins in refining can reach 20¢ per litre of gas, which represents $10 for an average fill-up of 50 litres. And 50 litres is exactly the capacity of my car's gas tank. That is definitely excessive—not my gas tank, but the profit margins in refining as high as 20¢ per litre of gas. I would like to reiterate that this means as much as $10 for the average fill-up. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068352">Generally, it is businesses, taxi drivers, farmers—since we are talking about the bill studied by the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food—and consumers who pay the price. Oil companies already benefit from preferential tax treatment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068353">Obviously, in light of all this, oil company executives are laughing merrily. In fact, the Competition Bureau does not have the tools to ensure that prices are not artificially inflated. When a very few companies almost completely control a market as large as the gasoline market, someone has to keep an eye on them. You see the same signs when travelling through cities, villages, or almost anywhere. There are only so many oil companies. We are referring primarily to the major oil companies that control the market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068354">Oil refining comes under the jurisdiction of the federal government. Thus, it is up to the House of Commons to ensure that the Bloc Québécois' Bill <Document DbId="3076433" Type="4">C-454</Document> is passed as quickly as possible in order for the Commissioner of Competition to take the necessary steps to prevent excessive gas price increases and oil company practices that are contrary to the public interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068355">With the approach of summer it is possible that consumers will once again suffer because of the inordinate price of gas. Our bill must proceed quickly and unimpeded if we want it to be in force before the summer holidays. Not that we are in a hurry for them to arrive—but they are coming. We know that gas prices escalate suddenly and mysteriously in the summer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068356">Our dependence on oil is also a contributing factor to Quebec's trade deficit. Between 2003 and 2007, Quebec exports rose from $64 billion to $70 billion compared to imports, which rose from $64 billion to $81 billion. We therefore have a trade deficit of $11 billion.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1068357">What is Quebec's largest import? Of course, it is oil. In 1998, Quebec imported $2.5 billion worth of oil and last year it imported $14 billion worth, which is an increase of 457%. The price per barrel of oil explains the astronomical increase. Last year, in 2007, not long ago, the price per barrel was roughly $70 and now it is over $100. It was $119 last time I checked. Unfortunately the price goes up more often than it goes down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068358">Quebec has a policy goal that all fuel sold will include 5% ethanol by 2012. It has already invested $6.5 million in building two cellulosic ethanol production plants in the Eastern Townships, one in Westbury and the other in Sherbrooke. That is not so far from my riding. Cellulosic ethanol is the way of the future. I have already talked about this, as have a number of my colleagues in this House. The process promotes the use of agricultural residues, such as straw, and forestry residues, such as wood chips, along with trees and fast growing grasses, such as switchgrass. Bill <Document DbId="3159092" Type="3">C-33</Document> will allow the emergence of this new generation of biofuels.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068359">Biodiesel is another type of preferred biofuels. There is a biodiesel plant in Sainte-Catherine, Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068360">Beef producers currently have to dispose of their specified risk materials. That is a Canadian standard beef producers have to comply with. We are not against it, but we would like to see reciprocity with U.S. standards. But that is for another debate. One thing is certain for now, producers have to get rid of these materials, which end up in the landfill. Often, unfortunately, producers have to pay out of their own pockets to get rid of these animal materials that can no longer be used, not even to make feed for other animals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068361">If we gave these materials added value by turning them into biodiesel, we could kill two birds with one stone. We could turn these materials into fuel. That is what sustainable development is all about. Instead of throwing out the material, burying it or paying to have it removed, we could pay for it once it has value and turn it into biodiesel. The technology already exists and this is already being done. Biodiesel is currently being made out of animal fats.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068362">The Fédération des producteurs de bovins du Québec has studied the feasibility of setting up a plant to process animal carcasses and slaughterhouse byproducts into biofuel. Strategic partnerships and help from the government are needed to get that kind of project of the ground.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068363">We have Bill <Document DbId="3159092" Type="3">C-33</Document>, but we will have to go much farther than that in developing a policy to promote biofuels that have few negative environmental impacts, or at least far fewer than petroleum and fewer than the foods we could use to make biofuels.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068364">According to the Fédération des producteurs de bovins du Québec, we have to ensure that the life cycle of renewable fuels offers true environmental and energy benefits compared to oil products. That is why we should support the federation's project.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068365">I have also talked about the training and recycling centre, CFER, in Victoriaville in my riding. In cooperation with 10 restaurants, this organization recycles used oil, the kind used for french fries, among other things. They are recycling it to make fuel. A pharmacy in Victoriaville even uses this kind of fuel in its delivery vehicle. Here in the House, I joked about how when one is driving behind the delivery vehicle, one does not necessarily get a smell of french fries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068366">Obviously, that is an important way to use it, a way that will not necessarily consume more energy in transportation. If the vehicle that collects this used oil goes to each of the restaurants and runs on used oil, itself, and if they manage to sell that oil at the pumps one day, that will be a huge energy gain. They are not yet at that point. It is still experimental, but the vehicle works very well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068367">Let us take this one step further. For example, sludge from sewage treatment plants can also be transformed into ethanol. Quebec's national scientific research institute came—once again—to Victoriaville.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1068368">I do not know if they did a very exhaustive study, but one thing is sure: the institute said that sludge from the Victoriaville sewage treatment plant could be transformed into ethanol. This is the kind of project we should be encouraging if we really want to reduce our oil dependency.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1068380">It is important to note that there are many kinds of biofuels. That is why I focused on biofuels made from cellulosic ethanol. There is biodiesel made from canola, which the NDP member for <Affiliation DbId="79025" Type="2">Western Arctic</Affiliation> spoke about earlier, but as I was saying, there are also animal oils, animal carcasses and other waste materials that can be used to produce biodiesel.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1068383">Mr. Speaker, this is a concern that I raised yesterday in the report stage debate in the sense that too often when we debate these kinds of issues here in the House it becomes very polarized. Again today we heard the statement about a wholesale change to biofuels.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068384">The government is not proposing a wholesale change to biofuel. We are talking about a very minimal biofuel content in our fuel. We also recognize that only about 5% of our land is used to produce crops that will be used for biofuel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068385">Does my hon. colleague think that, as our minister pointed out not too long ago, the weather pattern changes can actually have a greater impact than just the 5% of land use that is used for ethanol production?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1068386">Mr. Speaker, in fact, to answer my colleague's question, the Government of Quebec has established a policy on the use of biofuels. It is quite similar, since Quebec hopes to increase the use of ethanol in fuel to 5% by 2012. Once again, Quebec has made a choice. The government, and probably a vast majority of the population, decided that this ethanol should be cellulosic ethanol.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068387">There are pilot plants, as I mentioned earlier. We must therefore encourage the development of this new ethanol production. If we simply say that this is how it is, that it is in the works, nothing will get done. I therefore hope that the Conservative government, which has established its own policy for the use of ethanol in fuel, will allocate the funds needed to ensure that these new alternatives can be developed and that it does not simply say that it will change the crops in our fields, as is the case in some countries, to make fuel. That is where the danger lies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068388">The current food crisis was not brought about exclusively by the use of biofuels, or agrofuels as some people are now calling them, for there are many other factors involved. Consider the stock market speculation concerning food, the droughts there have been, especially in Australia, which is a major wheat producer and has been suffering drought conditions for years, which cause productivity problems. Consider also China and India, where there are more and more people who now have the means to feed themselves a little better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068389">Another thing that concerns me is the rising price of food products. We cannot blame biofuels alone, given that rice is the product that has risen the most in cost in recent months. It has gone up nearly 100%. To my knowledge, there is not a single grain of rice fueling any vehicles. The price of milk has also gone up rather outrageously and I am pretty sure that no one is putting milk in their gas tanks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068390">I am not saying that biofuels have no impact. They do. We must be extremely vigilant about this, but many other factors are also at play.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1068391">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to speak to the bill and to the amendments that our party has put forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068392">I will begin by assuring those who are concerned about our party's position on biofuels in general that this is something that needs to be part of the mix to deal with the catastrophic climate change that is in front of us. However, we also need to be cautious. The do no harm principle should be invoked, the precautionary principle, which is why our party has taken the stand it has. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068393">As we have noted recently, both in the House and in the debate that has occurred in Canadian society and, indeed, globally on the issue, if we look at the advantages of ethanol and biofuels, ethanol being part of the biofuel mix, we have to ascertain what the cost benefits are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068394">When we take a look at ethanol as an example, which seems to be the one that is the most popular, and certainly the supports are fairly strong within the government, we need to look at the costs in terms of the production of the corn for the ethanol as part of the mix for gas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068395">I recall years ago, when ethanol first became an option, that many said that we should be careful in what we were doing and that we should look at it both in terms of the cost of transporting the goods to production, in other words, the corn from the farmer's field that goes to the plant to mix the ethanol, and the effects on the environment there. We were also told to drill down deeper and look at the actual costs in terms of the production costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068396">It has emerged, if we use ethanol as an example because that is the one that has the most production, focus and support, that there is a huge amount of investment in fertilizer, for instance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068397">There is an important aspect to fertilizer that we should be dealing with. Fertilizer, as we know, comes from natural gas. If we are disproportionately using things like fertilizer, which is a fuel and one that is not renewable, and we are using that to help with the production of corn for ethanol, it should be part of the cost benefit analysis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068398">I would also add that when we are looking at the other resources that are required for growing corn, certainly for ethanol purposes, there is a fairly substantive use of water as a resource. Again, if we look at the whole mix and what is required in the recipe for ethanol, that is something that should be taken into account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068399">The use of fertilizer is not something that has been fully analyzed, in other words, the degree to which it will be using the fuel that is required to make fertilizer. Many have pointed to this as a concern, notwithstanding the use of water. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068400">When we look at the tar sands as an example and the science around the tar sands, what was contemplated first in the science that was pushed was how to get oil out of the sands. That is fair enough and innovative. Some work was done on that. What I do not think was contemplated was what happens with the waste.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068401">We have seen this not just with the tar sands but also with nuclear energy. What I think most of us want to see is a very genuine, thorough analysis of the effects and costs in the production of any new energy source.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068402">In the case of the tar sands, Alberta is about to become a have not province, not in terms of fiscal capacity but in water capacity. Australia was mentioned earlier regarding some of the problems it is having with drought. Water is a resource we take for granted but we should be very careful in how we use it, especially in relation to agricultural production. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1068403">We have new technologies such as ethanol. I mentioned nuclear power. We still have not figured out what to do with spent nuclear waste in a safe way into which everyone can buy. I mentioned the tar sands. However, when we deal with ethanol, we have to ensure we have done the proper analysis and due diligence. That is the thrust of our amendments and our concerns about the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068404">A member of Liberal Party, in statements to the press, was trying to convince his colleagues to slow down on the bill and not support it to the degree that we see with the official opposition, and that perhaps it would make sense to amend the bill with some of the amendments we brought forward, to have the oversight and to send it back to committee to do the cost benefit analysis, as I just made. He said that we should admit that things have changed, that since we made assumptions when we looked to ethanol as the way to deal with catastrophic climate change, new evidence had appeared. I suggest that would be the right notion and probably good advice for his caucus colleagues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068405">I do not assume the governing party will change its direction. It has been noted for going ahead regardless. However, I would plead with the opposition, and certainly with the Bloc, to take a reasoned and sensible analysis of the bill and the concerns we have with it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068406">The question is, why rush into it? Why not have amendments put forward, as we have done, to do due diligence? If we find 10 years hence that we have in fact gone in the wrong direction, the question will be, why were we in a rush to do this?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068407">It will be difficult for government members and other members of Parliament to get a satisfactory answer when we put amendments forward at committee to have due diligence done. We put forward amendments at report stage. We put forward an amendment today to ensure we were careful with this and due diligence was done. That is important to note.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068408">As my colleagues have said, we are not talking about an ideological view. We are talking about scientists saying that we should be very careful in how we go forward with our biofuel policy. Many have suggested that this is the wrong way to go without the proper oversight, as I mentioned. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068409">I find it interesting that in his comments this morning, the minister suggested that this was not about the global map right now, that we were only talking about Canada. That is fair enough. We are in the Parliament of Canada and we are discussing the Government of Canada's policy on biofuels. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068410">The problem with that statement or that analysis by the minister is it denies we are in a global economy. I find it intriguing that I am making this statement for members of the party who suggest that they are the ones who understand the global economy. What we do with our biofuels policy matters to the rest of the world, as does our policy on the tar sands. I share that with the House because if the minister's suggestion is that our policy on biofuels in Canada does not affect the global economy or that we do not have a role to play, I would fundamentally disagree with him on that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068411">At one point, he said that we needed to deal with an issue because of climate change. He then mentioned that recently there was snow in his province and that the farmers were in the fields. He made a passing remark about it being global warming. It suggests to me that the Conservatives do not have a consensus yet in their caucus about whether global warming exists. I hope that is not the case. This has been a long learning curve for the governing party. I know at one point it denied climate change and the science of it. I hope it was a lightened remark as opposed to an unenlightened analysis.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1068412">It is about good policy, and the policy we form here does affect the global view and what happens in the world. The government has been very clear about Canada's role. I think the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> coined the phrase that he wanted Canada to be an energy superpower. If we are going to be, on the one hand, an energy superpower and, on the other hand, making policy on biofuels and suggesting this is only for Canada and it does not really affect the rest of the world, there is incongruity. What he is saying is that what we do here will not affect what happens around the world, and I could not disagree with him more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068413">Let us look at the analyses and studies that have been brought forward. The chief economist for the U.S. agriculture department is very critical of what is happening with biofuel policy. Gwyn Morgan, no close cousin of the NDP, has said that this is not the way to go. People have genuine questions about what the effects of this policy will be and we need to listen to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068414">All our party is asking for is some reason, due diligence and to ensure when we are formulate our policy, we do not do it in a hurry or be too hasty. If we do that, there are unintended consequences and, some would say, irreversible effects that will occur. Once we build into our mix of energy supply, put in certain supports and have legislative underpinnings to it, it is very difficult to undo. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068415">What that means for not only the environment but our economy is that we will then have our eggs distributed in the wrong basket. I will not say they would all be in one basket with this legislation, but it gives the nod to the economy and says, “This is where you should be investing”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068416">It was noted by the minister in his comments this morning that perhaps weather could have more of an effect on the supply of fuel, the cost of fuel, et cetera. Granted, I would concur with him on that. However, the same can be said about the supply, in terms of ethanol, that will be built in if there is a bad crop. What happens if there is a drought? What will happen then is we might have to look far afield, pardon the pun, to supply the mix that has been built into the system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068417">I would like to see the analysis on that. What is the last decade's analysis for the supply of some of these crops that we will be dependent upon, even with the minimum that we have established presently? Those kinds of things need to be understood.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068418">The other thing I find interesting is the people who are lobbying for ethanol in particular. We know the person at the top of the association, who was running the lobby effort for this, was lobbying one day for the industry and the next day was working for the government. I find it that interesting. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068419">We need to be absolutely clear as to the premise for which these policies are brought in. Is it the best direction for our country in terms of the economy, climate change and to ensure we have the right mix? Many people would be surprised that someone who lobbied for this policy one day, ended up the next day in the Conservative government, directing where that policy would go. Again, that is important to note.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068420">If we look at what the legislation purports to do, and certainly the government will say it will do, and look at some of the concerns brought forward by scientists, there is no clarity. There is not enough clarity for my party and I think opposition members, because we have heard from some who are concerned about their party's position, to say that we should rush ahead and do this.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1068421"> There has not been sufficient argument to say that we cannot hold back, that we have to go ahead immediately because the sky will fall. When we look at some of the arguments that have been made about concerns of bringing this policy forward, we can still slow down, take a look at the cost benefit and have this kind of policy put in place. It is a false premise for those who say we have to rush this through now. Those who have taken a look at the direction of ethanol and biofuels mix have argued the opposite, that we can still go in the right direction on this, but it is important we get the balance right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068422">We do not take this lightly. We have seen what happens once we start down this direction. We see the concerns in the United States. As I referenced, the chief economist for the Department of Agriculture in the United States has thrown up the cautionary flag and said that they have a problem, that have done too much in one area and that it is undermining the capacity for the United Stated in terms of agriculture. I do not want to be put a corner like the Americans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068423">As my colleague from Hamilton said, this is something we should rethink and be cautious about. It was interesting to note the editorial he referenced from <I>The Toronto Star</I> the other day. It states:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1068426">This is a reasonable question, and it should be put back to the committee to answer it. What is unreasonable about that question? If we are to do due diligence, if in fact this whole policy is to deal with the catastrophic climate change that is in front of us, then why would we not do our homework on this? Why would we not look at an impact, not just of when the fuel comes out the tailpipe, but look at the production of that fuel? We can do that. In fact scientists have done this, working with farmers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068427"> There is a suggestion that if we are critical of this policy, that somehow we do not support farmers. It is unfortunate that some are using this argument to create a wedge between society in general, which wants to deal with that catastrophic climate change, and the challenges that confront farmers. Our party has been clear for decades about the way to support farmers. We believe in the Wheat Board and other institutions that have been built by farmers. We are not going to undermine them. I think this is something where the government is trying to create a wedge. I have talked to farmers locally and they do not buy that. They are as concerned as the rest of us on this rush to put in legislation that would tip the hat one way in terms of where agricultural direction is going. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068428">I hope that reason will carry the day, that the government will take a second look at this and that the opposition will support our amendments. I hope we can look back 10 years from now and say that we did the right thing, that we did due diligence and we made sure that we did not rush into something that we had not thought through thoroughly.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1068429">Mr. Speaker, I hardly know where to begin after listening to that, but let me start with a phrase that I heard the NDP member use repeatedly throughout his dissertation: why rush into this? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068430">I do not know how long the NDP would like to study this issue, but as a former farmer and someone who is proud to represent a large rural riding with a large agricultural component, which is unlike the riding the member represents, I have to tell him that a lot of farmers have been waiting a long, long time already for this type of option. They have been waiting for this option to see it impact favourably on commodity prices, even in a small way, so they can receive a better return from the marketplace, as opposed to taxpayers being forced to assist them in order to keep them afloat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068431"> They are looking forward to this. I hope they are watching this debate today. I hope they are watching the NDP members stand in their places and vote against giving farmers this option, this alternative for which they already have been waiting years. They have been waiting for years for governments to catch up to the technology that farmers have known was out there. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068432">What do we see now? Farmers are looking forward to this legislation. They would argue strenuously with the hon. member and would say that we are not rushing into this at all. They have already waited some time for this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068433">Never mind the environmental benefits, this change in policy could be of great advantage to the struggling forestry sector in my riding and the riding of my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="79032" Type="2">Cariboo—Prince George</Affiliation>. We could start utilizing more of the wood waste from trees to produce biofuel. Never mind that advantage. Never mind the environmental advantage in reducing CO<Sub>2</Sub> emissions, which the member himself admitted. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068434">These are all positive things, yet the NDP wants to vote against this legislation. They want to kill it. They want to stop. They want to wait for another 5, 10, 15 or 20 years while they study this some more. Rather than taking a positive step and moving forward, those members want to send the bill back to committee.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1068443">He said: Mr. Speaker, I hope that you do not get the feeling that I am always talking, since I just spoke during another debate. I want to say that this bill is particularly close to my heart and that I am moved today as I speak to this issue, not only because this is my bill, but because a number of people worked on this bill. These people deserve our consideration, and that is why we drafted such a measure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068444">I will briefly explain Bill <Document DbId="3073383" Type="4">C-445, An Act to amend the Income Tax Act (tax credit for loss of retirement income)</Document>. This enactment amends the Income Tax Act to provide a refundable tax credit to a taxpayer in respect of whom an employer and the employees failed to make the contributions required to be made to a registered pension plan. It was introduced at first reading on May 17, 2007. Today, nearly one year later, we are ready to debate it at second reading. It is making good progress. We hope that the bill will move quickly through Parliament so that the people affected get what is coming to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068445">I will give a brief account of how this bill came to be. In my riding, the Jeffrey mine, a chrysotile mine, went bankrupt, throwing many people out of work. Unfortunately, their retirement fund also disappeared like snow in the sun because there was a loophole when the company went bankrupt. People lost a great deal of money in all this. For years, Jeffrey mine retirees used every possible means to obtain some compensation. The Government of Quebec gave a certain amount of money at a given point, but it was a one-time contribution that did not cover their losses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068446">What could be done? These people came to see me to determine what could be done. At the same time, retirees from Atlas Steels, in Sorel, also went to see their MP, who will speak in a few moments. We worked together, along with the member for <Affiliation DbId="78501" Type="2">Chambly—Borduas</Affiliation> who worked very effectively on this file, to see what could be done at the federal level to help these people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068447">Mr. Gaston Fréchette, chair of the Jeffrey Mine retirees subcommittee in Asbestos, in my riding, represents more than 1,000 retirees who worked at the mine. There are about 1,200 in all. In addition, Mr. Pierre Saint-Michel is the chair of the Atlas Steels retirees group, which has just under 300 members. These people and their supporters—there are many—truly worked with us. Mr. Fréchette came up with the idea of a tax credit. We met with them here and we held press conferences in Asbestos and in the riding of the member for <Affiliation DbId="78481" Type="2">Bas-Richelieu—Nicolet—Bécancour</Affiliation>, who also participated in these discussions. Together, we came up with the basis for Bill <Document DbId="3073383" Type="4">C-445</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068448">When I said that this was an issue close to my heart and that I was moved speaking about the bill, it is because I saw these people wrack their brains, approach us and ask what we could do to help them. And then they worked on the bill with us so that we could introduce it. I would therefore like to thank not only Mr. Fréchette and Mr. Saint-Michel but all those individuals and retirees who helped out. I would like to extend a very warm thank you to the members for <Affiliation DbId="78481" Type="2">Bas-Richelieu—Nicolet—Bécancour</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="78501" Type="2">Chambly—Borduas</Affiliation> because, without them, there would not be a bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068449">I would like to briefly explain what this bill will do once it comes into force. As I was saying, it would create a refundable tax credit for loss of retirement income. Many retirees have seen their income drop because their retirement fund was running a deficit when their company ceased operations. That is what happened to people who retired from Atlas Stainless Steels, which belongs to Ontario's Slater Steel, and from the Jeffrey mine in Asbestos, closer to home. To help retirees caught in this situation, we propose creating a refundable tax credit for loss of retirement income.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068450">This refundable tax credit, which would amount to 22% of lost income, would not affect retirees' income, whether or not they pay income tax. The credit would also be transferrable to a surviving spouse and would apply to both money purchase and defined benefit plans. Accordingly, a retiree whose income drops from $30,000 to $20,000 would receive 22% of the $8,000 lost, which would be a non-taxable amount of $1,760.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1068451">We do not believe that retirees should have trouble making ends meet because they are not receiving the retirement income they contributed to for years. That is what happened to retirees from Atlas Stainless Steels in Sorel-Tracy, whose income has dropped between 28% and 58% since July 1, 2005, and is still dropping.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068452">Passing this bill will make it possible for all retirees caught in this kind of situation to recover part of the money lost. Take, for example, retirees from the Jeffrey mine. Since 2003, they have lost $55 million from their pension fund and $30 million in benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068453">Of course, this bill would not be retroactive. My colleagues should understand that when it comes into force, this bill will apply to the previous tax year. We will not be able to go any farther back than that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068454">Retirees whose complementary pension fund is smaller than it should have been will be compensated, as will surviving spouses, when they are entitled to part of the income.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068455">The tax credit is 22%. Some may wonder where we came up with that figure. It corresponds to the federal marginal tax rate that applies to the middle class. For people whose income is between $36,000 and $72,000, the tax rate is 22%. That is where we came up with that percentage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068456">The tax credit is refundable so that everyone can take advantage of it, even those whose incomes are very low and who do not pay taxes. It is a matter of social justice for us. We thought about this. I know that this morning, a ruling was unfortunately made concerning royal assent. From what I understand, if the tax credit had not been refundable, the decision would have been different. We are bound by the royal assent, but I hope that the government will listen to reason.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068457">We made this choice thinking of the poorest members of society. We knew that some people had lost their retirement income, and that some of them had even less money than others. A non-refundable tax credit would have benefited only those with more money. Some people would have been eligible, but I think, unfortunately, that most of our retirees would not have been able to take advantage of the tax credit. That might have been a step in the right direction, but I think it would have been unfair to do it that way. That is why we went with the idea of a refundable tax credit in the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068458">I just explained that low-income people would have essentially been left out. The elected members, at least these three members, as well as the people from the two retiree committees I mentioned earlier, felt that the bill should apply to everyone, especially the least well off. I would like to congratulate the members of the retiree committees who were also thinking of their less fortunate colleagues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068459">We have to determine how many people this will affect in Quebec. I have heard rumours that the government thinks this measure would take a big chunk out of the consolidated revenue fund. I can say that in Quebec, we have found only two cases where the bill would help now-retired victims of business closures. I am referring to the two cases we have been talking about since the beginning of this debate— Atlas Steels in Sorel and the Jeffrey mine in Asbestos. These are victims of very exceptional cases—I do not know if we can call them very exceptional, but exceptional at the very least—that should never happen again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068460">Take Quebec for example, again. The Quebec government changed its legislation to require improved capitalization of money purchase benefit plans. And there should not be many cases that come up in Canada either. In Ontario, there is a government fund set up to replenish the pension plans of employees who find themselves in a similar situation. Luckily, governments have made adjustments so that there will not be any more situations like those that the retirees in Asbestos and Sorel have had to deal with. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068461">We are now seeing measures like this in a number of provinces. Perhaps there are former workers from the St. Anne Nackawic Pulp Company Limited in New Brunswick who might be eligible—our research service looked into this. We could study the file in committee, since we have not been able to determine if this is the case or not. More examples like this could come up, but it would not involve many workers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068462">But even though this may not affect many people, we cannot simply wash our hands of it and stop worrying. Quite the opposite. One thing is certain: we are talking about very few cases and about exceptional situations. The fact that they are exceptional does not mean that they are any less important for the people involved.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1068463">We are talking about people who contributed to their employer's pension fund their entire lives only to end up with almost nothing once they retire.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068464">The intention of Bill <Document DbId="3073383" Type="4">C-445</Document> is not to hand out a lump sum payment, but to provide an annual payment equivalent to 22% of the loss. If we take the actuarial deficit of the two retirement funds for the people we are talking about, we expect this to cost roughly $1.7 million in the first year for Quebec. Obviously, that amount will decrease over the years as the number of former employees decreases. For all of Canada this measure is estimated to cost between $3 million and $5 million, again if we take the example of the retirees I am referring to. More may be discovered with the current provincial measures, and if we look back, but note that this measure is not retroactive. In cases such as Singer and others, retirees have been compensated. At first we thought about including those cases in our bill, but they are different cases. This exception really only concerns two industries, two companies in Quebec and maybe one in New Brunswick. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068465">Why does this issue concern the federal government? The federal government has a constitutional right to legislate while respecting the supremacy of provincial and Quebec legislation, of course, with respect to old age pensions and additional benefits, including survivor benefits and disability benefits, regardless of age. That is one of the reasons. The compensation set out in Bill <Document DbId="3073383" Type="4">C-445</Document>—and I wish to emphasize this—is provided as a tax credit. It has no impact on other government program benefits, does not interfere in any way in provincial social programs and is therefore very respectful of the division of powers. The Bloc Québécois would never show up with a bill calling on the federal government to interfere in provincial jurisdictions. That is why I wanted to emphasize this, in case that was what anyone was thinking, but that would surprise me. Most parties here understand what I am saying. The government has a say in this type of procedure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068466">There are other reasons as well. With a monetary policy that produces recurring deficits and a fiscal policy that does not allow the government to build up a surplus in good years, Ottawa is also responsible for providing relief for retirees who have to pay the price. These are good reasons why the federal government has a role to play in this issue.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1068472">Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member opposite for presenting his bill today. It gives us an opportunity to discuss it. I recognize the concern of the Bloc members on the issue of helping seniors, which is also important to us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068473">The government has been doing a number of things for seniors. For the first time in history, we provided pension splitting for seniors. There is an increase in the budget of the new horizons for seniors program of $10 million to raise awareness of elder abuse and other issues they face, including fraud. We are giving older workers the choice to stay in the labour market by permitting phased-in retirement. We are doubling the amount of pension income eligibility for the pension income credit, which benefits nearly 2.7 million pensioners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068474">In his speech, I heard the member talk about the costs of the two, possibly three, locations that he was referring to, and it is not retroactive. I did not hear any long term projections of what this may cost the Government of Canada over the years. If it applies now, would it not apply in the future? Does he have any sense of what the financial issues might be for the Government of Canada in the future?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068475">I find it interesting that he did try to make a distinction between provincial and federal jurisdictions. When the Bloc members want something from the federal government, it is always very easy for them to justify that it is a federal jurisdiction, but when the federal government tries to do something to help Quebeckers, there is often a push back from that party that it is a provincial jurisdiction and that the federal government should stay out of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068476">From a finance point of view, I would like to know, has he studied the long term financial issues in presenting this bill?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1068488">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to Bill <Document DbId="3073383" Type="4">C-445</Document>, a proposal for a refundable tax credit for shortfalls in pension income, which has been introduced by my good friend, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78421" Type="2">Richmond—Arthabaska</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068489">The intention of the member's proposal is somewhat laudable. It seeks to assist Canadians who have seen their retirement incomes negatively impacted by a failed business. Unfortunately, it is fundamentally flawed to such a degree that we cannot support it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068490">The biggest problem with Bill <Document DbId="3073383" Type="4">C-445</Document> is its annual cost, as was referred to previously by my colleague in a question, which is estimated to be approximately $10 billion. Clearly, were Bill C-445 to be enacted, it would have a negative impact on Canada's fiscal position. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068491">This proposal also raises serious concerns with respect to pension and tax policy, while also failing to take into account the multitude of prudent ways we are improving Canada's retirement income system. Again, as previously mentioned, Bill <Document DbId="3073383" Type="4">C-445</Document> relates to the tax treatment of pensions and savings, an area that this Conservative government has recognized as a key priority, an important element for economic growth as well as an improvement for living standards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068492">As I am sure the House is well aware, our Conservative government has implemented an ambitious and aggressive agenda to reduce the tax burden on Canadians by cutting corporate taxes and personal income taxes, cutting the GST and many more. Tax cuts have prompted Canada's competitiveness and improved our standard of living, but tax cuts also spur investment while creating jobs, encouraging economic growth and allowing the freedom for Canadians to save.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068493">Personal savings provide Canadians a means to invest in their own future and improve their standard of living. Savings also bring the peace of mind that comes with the knowledge that funds will be available in the event of an emergency or for future endeavours like starting a small business, purchasing a home, or a child's education.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068494">Our Conservative government has taken major steps to improve incentives for Canadians to save. Most significantly I would point to the introduction in budget 2008 of the tax-free savings account, commonly known in the House as TFSA, whose introduction has been heralded in nearly all corners as an exceedingly positive initiative, perhaps the single most important personal savings vehicle since the introduction of RRSPs in 1957.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068495">Indeed McGill University Professor William Watson praised it as a “great step forward for the country...almost all Canadians will now be able to shelter all their savings from tax”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068496">TFSA will be a flexible, registered, general purpose account that will allow Canadians to earn tax-free investment income. As the TFSA matures over the next 20 years it will permit over 90% of Canadians to hold all of their financial assets in tax efficient savings vehicles in combination with existing registered plans. In 20 years, relative to the size of today's economy, the tax relief provided by the TFSA will grow to over $3 billion annually.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068497">In addition to the landmark TFSA, our Conservative government has introduced a number of tax measures to improve the pension and RRSP system, such as: doubling the amount of eligible income that can be claimed under the pension income tax credit to $2,000, the first increase since 1975; increasing the maximum age to 71 by which Canadians must convert their RRSPs to registered retirement income funds and begin receiving pension payments; permitting employers to offer more flexible phased retirement programs in order to retain older, experienced workers and ease succession planning pressures; increasing the age credit amount; and permitting pension income splitting. The cumulative effect of these important measures represents nearly $1.6 billion in tax relief every year for pensioners and seniors.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1068498">Clearly, this Conservative government has worked to improve the tax treatment of pensions and RRSPs and to make our retirement income system even more effective in meeting the needs of Canadians, and we will do more. However, we must make certain that policies are prudent and consistent with sound pension and tax policy principles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068499"> Regrettably, Bill <Document DbId="3073383" Type="4">C-445</Document>'s proposal to introduce a refundable tax credit for pension shortfalls is neither the most prudent nor the best way to promote the security of pension benefits. It would create undesirable economic incentives for pension plan sponsors and would be an improper use of the tax system. As well, it would be exceedingly costly and unfair in its application.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068500">I will now expand on the points to which I have just alluded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068501"> Bill <Document DbId="3073383" Type="4">C-445</Document> would go far beyond its proposed intent. It would not provide a refundable tax credit in respect of shortfalls in pension income but would instead effectively provide a refundable credit on the full amount of pension benefits received by most retirees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068502"> This is because, as drafted, the proposed credit would be based on the difference between the pension benefits payable to an individual from a registered pension plan and the amount of benefits received by the individual from a retirement compensation arrangement. As a result, the proposed credit would be extremely costly. In fact, it would cost about $10 billion annually. I am assuming that this is why the Speaker ruled earlier today that this private member's bill does require a royal recommendation. I would concur with his decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068503">Such a costly measure clearly would not be supportable. Let us make no mistake: it would put Canada into deficit and would put at risk the fiscal health of future generations of Canadians. Regardless of whether Bill <Document DbId="3073383" Type="4">C-445</Document> has been drafted properly, its underlying objective is to provide a government-backed guarantee for pension benefits. This would not be good tax or economic policy and would not be fair to the taxpayers of the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068504">The tax system is not intended to ensure or compensate individuals for the loss of pension benefits due to the underfunding of pension plans. Indeed, the proposed refundable credit would set a significant precedent for government compensation of shortfalls in expected retirement income in other situations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068505">Let us consider the example of an RRSP saver or an individual in a defined contribution pension plan who does not achieve the pension income he or she expects because of poor investment performance. Bill <Document DbId="3073383" Type="4">C-445</Document> would mean he or she could request that a similar credit or other compensation be provided to help offset such shortfalls. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068506">There are a number of other significant concerns with the proposal. For example, it would effectively mean that the federal government would provide compensation for shortfalls in pension income for provincially regulated plans. Moreover, providing a government-backed guarantee is not the best way to protect pension benefits. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068507">The best way of ensuring that promised pension benefits are secure is to have healthy plans with good supervision. Providing any kind of guarantee or compensation for pension benefits, whether through the tax system or otherwise, is potentially costly for taxpayers. In addition, it raises issues of fairness, given that the costs would be borne by all taxpayers while the benefits would accrue only to a minority of those participating in pension plans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068508">Therefore, I urge members not to support this fundamentally flawed proposal.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1068509">Mr. Speaker, I am happy to join this debate. I cannot help but make the comparison between what our Conservative government is doing and the same approach that the American Republicans have taken with their interventions abroad. With the $10 billion price tag on this piece of legislation, I think the government wants to “shock and awe” my Bloc colleague into pulling the bill out of the House. I do not think that is going to work in this House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068510">This is a very important issue. Certainly it is important to make sure that seniors, Canadians who have worked their entire lives, are able to retire with some degree of health, support and dignity. I want to commend my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78421" Type="2">Richmond—Arthabaska</Affiliation> for bringing this legislation forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068511">As has been brought up in previous interventions and in the parliamentary secretary's speech, there are aspects of the bill that are of much concern. Certainly, our finance critic is not comfortable with a couple of areas of the bill, and I would like to bring them forward later on in my address. Finance officials also have concerns with how the bill reads and if it is as focused as it should be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068512">Nonetheless, I want to state on the record that I think it is important to bring this bill forward to committee so that these issues are addressed in committee. That is where we will able to have a full hearing. That is where we will be able to tap into the advice and recommendations from expert witnesses. We think that is where the bill belongs. We will be supporting that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068513">As I understand it, the bill deals with defined benefit pensions. When seniors retire, they anticipate that the defined package is going to be there for them, but let us say that they are not able to have the income they anticipated, for whatever reason. That certainly would have an impact on lifestyle and on people's ability to provide for themselves and their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068514">The bill provides for a 22% tax credit for any lost income. If a person thought he or she was going to be drawing $35,000 and was only able to draw $30,000, then that 22% tax credit would be applied to the $5,000 difference, for about $1,100.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068515">I think this bill deserves to be brought forward and looked at in committee. The member for <Affiliation DbId="78554" Type="2">Burlington</Affiliation> made his intervention and talked about all the great tax room that has been given by the government since it came to power, but I will give the government just a little reminder.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068516"> I will use this opportunity in debate to remind the government of one tax increase, and that would be the tax increase on income trusts. We all remember income trusts. We remember the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, through the 2005 election campaign, looking into the eyes of Canadians and promising outright that there would be no increase in the tax applied on income trusts. Therefore, Canadians felt confident and very comfortable in putting their money into those income trusts, but we know what happened. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068517">On Halloween 2006, the Conservatives pulled the plug. They put the tax on the income trusts. Within two days, $25 billion of money earned by and invested by Canadians was lost from the markets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068518"> Probably thousands of people were directly impacted by this broken promise, by this intervention of a 37.5% tax placed on income trusts. Thousands of Canadians were impacted, and probably millions indirectly, because most pension plans were invested in income trusts. Certainly CPP, which impacts or will impact every Canadian, was heavily invested in income trusts, so it did have an impact on all Canadians. We want to remind the government of that tax increase and the broken promise.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="05">(1405)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1068519">The Saskatoon <I>StarPhoenix</I> summed it up for me with regard to the reality of the income trust tax when it stated: “It's a huge impact for seniors. If you worked 40 years to create that nest egg and in a short time you lose one-quarter of that wealth, it's like going back to work for 10 more years”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068520">That is what was said: “like going back to work for 10 more years”. I know seniors, the people who contributed to this country, the people who paid taxes all the way through, the people who are looking to retire with a little dignity. They deserve better. They deserve more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068521">Here we are talking about Canadians who have pension plans or who have had the opportunity to contribute to RRSPs and prepare a little for their retirement, but I want to remind the government about something else, too, because its members go to great lengths about some of the steps they have taken to help seniors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068522">The <Affiliation DbId="105827" Type="4">Minister of Human Resources</Affiliation> was at committee the other day and he almost separated his shoulder from patting himself on the back. He talked about increasing the amount for someone who receives the guaranteed income supplement. He talked about raising the ceiling as to how much he or she can earn. He thought this would be good for the labour market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068523"> It may have a minimal impact on the labour market, but he talked about how great it is for seniors. How many people who receive the guaranteed income supplement will that have an impact on? Some 4% of Canadians who receive the guaranteed income supplement are able to go to work. So really what the government has done is fail the 96% of Canadians who receive the guaranteed income supplement. They will receive no benefit whatsoever from that intervention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068524">What really scares me and my colleagues on this side of the House is the rise in food prices and the rise in gasoline prices. We see the cost of living going up, but we do not see any action on the other side to help those seniors who are most vulnerable. We have seen that this measure fails 96% of the seniors receiving GIS. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068525">Mr. Speaker, this coming fall--and mark my words, you will go back and refer to this in <I>Hansard</I>--we are going to have seniors in this country who will be up against it. We are going to see seniors who will have to decide if they will fill their fuel tank, fill their cupboards or fill their prescriptions. It is going to become that stark. The government has to do something.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068526">Certainly I believe we will be able to bring these issues forward when the bill goes to committee for study. We do have some concerns. We will see what the bill looks like coming out of committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068527">There are concerns that were shared with me by the critic and members on this side. We want to know if through this bill the government will guarantee all pension funds. Will this act as a disincentive for employers or employees to properly and fully contribute to and manage their funds? That is an important question. Hopefully the expert witnesses will be able to shed some light on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068528">For Canadians who do not have a defined benefit package or pension plan, we want to ask if it is fair for them to subsidize this. This is a question that has to be asked. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068529">We want to find out if the bill is worded properly. Does it ensure that it targets only retirees with these pensions?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068530"> We do not know if this bill is a proper solution, but it does merit further consideration. We have every confidence that the standing committee will bring forward the appropriate witnesses. We will get answers to these questions and hopefully from those answers we will find out whether or not the bill deserves further support.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1068531">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="3073383" Type="4">C-445, An Act to amend the Income Tax Act</Document>, specifically to provide a tax credit, which we have been hearing about in this debate, for the loss of retirement income. It was introduced by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78421" Type="2">Richmond—Arthabaska</Affiliation> and I appreciate that member's concern for the workers of his province and how this bill may help all workers across our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068532">However, before I get into my remarks, recently in this debate we heard from the Conservatives a list of all of the things that they have done for seniors. I have one more thing for them to put on their list and that is the $1 billion they owe seniors from the CPI mistake that was made a number of years ago. Each and every senior who is owed that $500 for each year should be addressed by the government and should receive the money. If they owed the government money, they certainly would have somebody knocking on their doors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068533">Back to Bill <Document DbId="3073383" Type="4">C-445</Document>, it would grant a refundable tax credit equal to 22% of the reduction in pension benefits experienced by beneficiaries, other than trusts, of registered pension plans who suffer a loss of pension benefits, normally when their pension plan is wound up in whole or in part. It applies to both defined benefit and defined combination plans. This bill certainly will catch the ear of Stelco workers in Hamilton who went through the CCAA bankruptcy protection recently. They saw the sale by their employer of their company and all the insecurity about their pension and benefits. They had to deal with this stress for two years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068534">Seniors who have already retired and those who are about to retire have worked hard. They have played by the rules all of their lives and now they need their pension plans. They need their income to retire in dignity and respect. They too often find their retirement benefits reduced through no fault of their own. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068535">I will not suggest this bill would address fully the problems they will face but it offers some modest fairness for retirees. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068536">In addition to Bill <Document DbId="3073383" Type="4">C-445</Document>, we in the NDP call on the federal government to explore other options to help retirees which should be based on the premises: that all workers deserve decent pension coverage, that all workers deserve to get the pension they have earned, that we show respect for today's and tomorrow's retirees, that retirement investments must work for and not against workers, and that the government has a national job strategy so that dignified retirement is possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068537">A recent polling of Canadians found that 73% are worried about not having enough money to live on after retiring. Canadian workers worry about the solvency of their private pensions. They worry about the adequacy of both CPP and public income supports. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068538">They know, for instance, that inflation does far more damage to retirees than any other group of Canadians. Over 250,000 seniors today live under the poverty line, under that cutoff point. Too many retirees are living in poverty. It is the responsibility of the government to protect seniors and not leave them hung out to dry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068539">A particularly alarming statistic is that one-third of seniors, most of whom are women, have little income outside of OAS and GIS, and have an average annual income of around $12,000. How are these seniors expected to live in dignity on barely $1,000 a month? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068540">How are they expected to afford to stay in their family homes or expensive senior retirement residences or afford the cost of living and utility bills, not to mention the high price of gasoline for those who can still afford a car? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068541">How are they expected to afford the medications each month, especially since the government will not provide a national pharmacare program? How are seniors expected, after all of those expenses, to meet the high cost of food?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068542">Since the middle 1990s, according to the National Advisory Council on Aging, seniors' income levels have reached a ceiling and are no longer keeping pace with the rest of Canadians. In fact, the mean income of seniors rose only $4,100 compared to other Canadian households, which rose $9,000 between 1997 and 2003. Thirty per cent of families today have no private pension assets at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068543">In this age of insecurity and tremendous job loss in our manufacturing sector, as well as the pulp and paper sector, the federal government must look beyond today and beyond the next election cycle. It is time for some long range planning in conjunction with our defined pension plans as to how to support workers in their retirement years.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="10">(1410)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1068544">In my riding of <Affiliation DbId="78549" Type="2">Hamilton East—Stoney Creek</Affiliation>, I hear repeatedly about the moneys owed to seniors that I spoke about before. Regarding the error in the cost of living, we should imagine what a $500 per year repayment would do for somebody with an income of $12,000 per year and what it would mean to them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068545">The Conservative government has handed corporate Canada $14 billion in tax breaks each and every year, and only a pittance to seniors. When seniors owe tax to the government, they have to pay or they are charged interest that compounds daily. However, when the government owes money to seniors, it simply dismisses those seniors and tells them that they do not matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068546">The Conservatives tout their two point cut to the GST and the $60 billion they took out of the fiscal capacity of the Government of Canada to respond in a reasonable way to the plight of seniors. Seniors across Canada have to choose between buying medication and eating. That is disgraceful and the government should be ashamed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068547">The government should cancel the corporate tax cuts and use the money to give seniors a reasonable raise in their CPP benefits. The Conservatives should follow the lead of the NDP and start a national prescription drug program for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068548">The Conservatives should follow through on the promises they already made to seniors and implement the seniors charter, created by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78613" Type="2">Hamilton Mountain</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068549">In June 2006, nearly two years ago, the House passed the NDP's seniors charter, which called for the government to work with the provinces to rectify decades of underfunding of seniors programs. The seniors charter called for the recognition of older Canadians as creative, active and valued members of our society. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068550">The charter would have enshrined the right of every senior living in Canada to the following: income security, through protected pensions and indexed public income support that provides a reasonable state of economic welfare; housing, through secure, accessible and affordable housing; wellness, through health promotion and preventive care; health care, through secure, public, accessible, universal health care, including primary care, dental care, home care, palliative care, geriatric care and pharmacare; self development, through lifelong access to affordable recreation, education and training; government services, through timely access to all federal government programs and services, including family reunification.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068551">It would create a seniors advocate to: conduct public education and awareness initiatives on the rights of seniors; ensure that all new and revised policies and programs affecting seniors receive public input from older persons; require that all new policies and programs affecting seniors are announced with specific timelines for implementation; act as an ombudsman for seniors with respect to all government services and programs in making recommendations as appropriate that assist seniors; and that would advocate and report annually to Parliament on government policies and programs affecting seniors, including the effectiveness of federal funding related to the needs of older persons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068552">I wonder how many members present have had to eat cat food. I read an article on how seniors choose cat food because of its low price in order to get some protein because they simply cannot afford to purchase groceries. That is one of the great shames in this country. We have to do better. The government has to do better for our seniors and this is a national disgrace that can no longer be ignored.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="78481" Type="2">Mr. Louis Plamondon (Bas-Richelieu—Nicolet—Bécancour, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1068553">Mr. Speaker, it is also a pleasure for me to speak at second reading to Bill <Document DbId="3073383" Type="4">C-445</Document>, which was introduced by my colleague for <Affiliation DbId="78421" Type="2">Richmond—Arthabaska</Affiliation> and which I was honoured to second. I would first like to thank him for all the work he has done with me to prepare this bill. I would also like to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="78501" Type="2">Chambly—Borduas</Affiliation>, the Bloc Québécois researchers and the officers of the House of Commons who advised us on the legal aspects and the drafting of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068554">I would like to congratulate the member for <Affiliation DbId="78421" Type="2">Richmond—Arthabaska</Affiliation> because he expressed in his speech the very thoughts of the former employees of Atlas Steels and the Jeffrey mine. These people were treated unfairly and they were victims. This request is not based on a whim. They want to redress a wrong. He explained the financial blow dealt to these individuals who had already retired in the belief that their pensions were guaranteed for the rest of their lives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068555">I would like to thank the NDP member who spoke just before me. He definitely extended the debate to the complex issues faced by seniors, including health. From the outset, he said he was prepared, together with his party, to support the bill. I thank him. As for the few questions he may have, we will attempt to reassure him when we study the bill in committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068556">I would also like to thank the Liberal Party critic whose speech was very clear. From the start, he said that this bill deserved to be referred to committee. He said he had questions, and I understand that. He is entitled to have questions. But I think that he did not completely understand the purpose behind this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068557">The member for <Affiliation DbId="78421" Type="2">Richmond—Arthabaska</Affiliation>, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78501" Type="2">Chambly—Borduas</Affiliation> and I would be very happy to answer his questions and to appear before the committee. The former employees are also prepared to come and work with us, including Mr. Saint-Michel and the Jeffrey mine retirees' representative, Mr. Fréchette. They will come to explain the situation and I do not think they will have any problem answering the Liberal critic's questions. I thank him for supporting this bill. These two pledges of support, along with the support of all the Bloc members, ensure that this bill will be sent to committee so that it can move to the next stage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068558">However, the Conservative member's statement surprised me. I did tell several Conservative members from Quebec about this bill. I am not judging them, but it seems they may have forgotten to inform the parliamentary secretary, who spoke earlier. Talking about $10 billion shows that either he is trying to get people worked up about this or he has gone crazy. Imagine: $10 billion! We are talking about some 260 workers in one place and about 900 in another. The total per year would be $1.7 million. These people are not going to live forever. Every now and then, some of them die. They are not young, and a few years from now, this will not cost the government anything. Yet he was saying that it would cost $10 billion. Where did he get that number from?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068559">Perhaps his speech was influenced by the combined deficit of all public and private retirement funds in Canada. If all of those people lost their jobs and were covered by this bill, it would cost $10 billion. What kind of logic is that? It does not make sense. This is a matter of a few million dollars, and we are asking the government to fix an injustice. As I said earlier, it is not as though these workers acted on a whim. We have to demonstrate compassion for workers who have been deprived of income to which they had a legal right.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="20">(1420)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1068560">These people, like all workers, including the members of this House, paid contributions out of their income. The employer also paid, of course. Those contributions went into a fund and, all of a sudden, one third of the money was taken away without giving the retirees a say in the matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068561">However, this fund was supposed to be guaranteed. If hon. members who retire were suddenly told, a year later, that their pension was being cut by one third, I think the reaction would be violent or at least very noisy. An injustice has been done and we want to correct it. The people suffering this injustice worked hard for many years. They have managed to build up a strong claim and a bill was born out of this claim.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068562">Like my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78421" Type="2">Richmond—Arthabaska</Affiliation> before me, I would like to pay tribute to Pierre Saint-Michel and Gaston Fréchette and their two teams. They looked for a legal way to provide the workers with partial compensation for their losses. Today, after consulting experts, legislative drafters and House experts, they have finally found a solution to recover some of the loss. They will get that solution if every member of this House sets partisanship aside and understands the need to be compassionate and provide these people with social justice. This gesture, which would cost the government barely a few million dollars in the early years, would allow these people to obtain some compensation for their losses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068563">Today, I am calling on the Conservative members from Quebec to influence their government. I have chosen to sit as a sovereignist MP with a vision of Quebec sovereignty. They have chosen to sit within a party in power that claims to better defend the interests of Quebec. Well, ladies and gentlemen, now you have the opportunity to prove it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068564">I am calling on the members for <Affiliation DbId="78459" Type="2">Lévis—Bellechasse</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="78459" Type="2">Beauport—Limoilou</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="78345" Type="2">Pontiac</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="78461" Type="2">Beauce</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="78609" Type="2">Jonquière—Alma</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="78465" Type="2">Lotbinière—Chutes-de-la-Chaudière</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="79030" Type="2">Louis-Hébert</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="113961" Type="2">Roberval—Lac-Saint-Jean</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="78413" Type="2">Mégantic—L'Érable</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="78391" Type="2">Charlesbourg—Haute-Saint-Charles</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="78491" Type="2">Louis-Saint-Laurent</Affiliation>. They have said they might have some influence. Perhaps the critic and parliamentary secretary who spoke earlier might change his mind when the second hour of debate takes place in early June.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068565">I hope this bill will be referred to committee by a unanimous vote. I ask them to use their influence. It is time for these members to prove they do have some influence and to act to change the parliamentary secretary's speech and their party's vision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068566">The Liberal members have agreed to refer this bill to committee, and I thank them. The NDP members have also agreed, and I thank them. Of course, the Bloc Québécois will support this private member's bill, and I ask the Conservative members to do the same.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068567">I repeat, this is not a partisan gesture, but an act of human compassion and social justice. I therefore ask that all members support this bill and that, during the next hour of debate in early June, there be only speeches in support of this bill in this House so that we can act to reassure these people following the injustice they suffered a few years ago.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1068570">Bill <Document DbId="3073383" Type="4">C-445</Document>, which is sponsored by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78421" Type="2">Richmond—Arthabaska</Affiliation>, is a proposal for a refundable tax credit to deal with shortfalls in pension income. From the onset, I will state that we do not support this proposal as it is fundamentally flawed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068571">First and foremost, the largest issue with Bill <Document DbId="3073383" Type="4">C-445</Document> is cost, which the Department of Finance estimated to be approximately $10 billion. Clearly, supporting a proposal with a cost of this magnitude would be fiscally irresponsible and it would threaten Canada's fiscal health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068572">Furthermore, the proposal also raises serious issues with respect to pension and tax policy and ignores the present state of Canada's retirement income system. Bill <Document DbId="3073383" Type="4">C-445</Document> touches on a matter of importance to all workers, the security of their pensions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1068573">This government recognizes that the security of workers' pension benefits is a key element in ensuring the effectiveness of Canada's retirement income system. It has been recognized that Canada has a diversified retirement income system based on a mix of public and private pensions. The old age security and guaranteed income supplement programs, along with the Canada and Quebec pension plans, are considered to be the pillars of that system, ensuring a minimum level of income in retirement for Canadian seniors.</ParaText>
