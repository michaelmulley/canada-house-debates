              <ParaText id="942411">The situation is critical. There are texts circulating that call for the prohibition of subsidies, which would threaten the future of the fishery not only in Quebec, but in Canada. The texts mention subsidies in three areas. The first is infrastructure. As hon. members know, without wharves, there is no fishery. If we do not subsidize infrastructure, the future of the fishery is in danger.</ParaText>

As in the case of infrastructure, without fishing boats, there is no fishery, because companies depend on financial assistance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942413">The third area is income support. As hon. members are aware, this could affect employment insurance.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough—Rouge River, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="942418">Mr. Speaker, yesterday another colleague in the House rose on a point of order involving the mandate of a committee. I thought it might be helpful to the Chair if I provided a few more remarks which I felt yesterday were not fully addressed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942419">The question involves the operation of a committee and whether the committee is operating within its mandate and whether or not a committee when it drifts outside of its specific mandate should be communicated with by the House in some way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942420">I know, Mr. Speaker, you are reluctant and naturally so to interfere with the work of committees. They generally do a pretty good job of carrying on the work that is delegated to them by the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942421">The first thing I want to mention of course is the very basics here, the rules of the House. Mr. Speaker, you will know very clearly that the work of the committees is set by orders of reference and Marleau and Montpetit fortunately speak to this fairly clearly. I am not too sure I have to read Marleau and Montpetit, but I will refer to the page numbers just for reference here in the discussion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942422">On page 853 it states: “The Standing Orders provide standing committees with permanent orders of reference--” and on page 854, the authors write: “Committees are bound by their orders of reference and may not undertake studies or make recommendations to the House which go beyond the limits established by them”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942423">In this case the particular committee is the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics. That particular committee has adopted a motion the contents of which were made available to the House yesterday which purports to, and I will just use the short form here, “investigate the fundraising practices of the Liberal Party”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942424">That motion of the committee which was adopted has been provided to the House and, Mr. Speaker, if you want me to read it I can, but I probably do not have to. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942425">Mr. Speaker, you are indicating that I should read it. The motion that was adopted states:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942426">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That pursuant to Standing Order 108(1)(a) in relation to the conflicting reports about the fundraising practices of the Liberal Party, the committee investigate the fundraising practices of the Liberal Party of Canada, which - as evidenced by such recent events as, the February 13, 2008 Fundraising Auction at the Ottawa Congress Centre, the “Stéphane Dion’s Liberal Leaders Dinner” event of February 21, 2008, which accepted corporate money though the federal branch of the Liberal Party of Canada in Saskatchewan, the Halloween Spooktacular Carnival in Mississauga-Streetville of October 26th, 2007, which accepted corporate sponsors, and other prior events - potentially violate the Canada Elections Act by encouraging and allowing personal donations in excess of $1,100 dollars, as well as allowing and encouraging political donations from corporations, unions and associations.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942427">Essentially, it is a Canada Elections Act fundraising focus. Mr. Speaker, you will be the judge of what that appears to be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942428">In adopting the motion, I am suggesting that the members have gone way beyond the mandate of the committee. The committee's mandate is contained in the Standing Orders. It does not have any specific other reference or guidance from the House in terms of its order of reference. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942429">Mr. Speaker, if you read the order of reference from Standing Order 108(3)(h), you will find that there is really only one sub-category, 108(3)(h)(v) and (vi), which could in any way relate to what the committee is now purporting to do. I will just read subparagraph (vi): </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="942431">I would accept that if the proposed work of the committee had to do with public office holders there might be a connection. But in fact, the term “public office holders” is defined by the Conflict of Interest Act. It is defined in the definition sections of that statute and does not have a particular section number. However, it is clear that the Liberal Party of Canada is not a public office holder. Public office holders are generally appointees of the government: ministers and parliamentary secretaries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942432">The focus of the committee's motion here is the Liberal Party of Canada. It is not a public office holder, so there is no reasonable reading of these rules that would allow the committee a mandate to do this type of inquiry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942433">I suggest that if the committee can clearly go beyond its mandate, then the committee can look at the fundraising efforts of the United Nations Children's Fund in Canada, the National Citizens' Coalition, charitable and political action groups across the country, and it might as well just go and study the Department of National Defence or the employment insurance fund. Once the committee goes beyond its mandate, it is simply beyond its mandate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942434"> The point I want to try and make very clearly here is that the House should not allow its committees to do that. That would seem to be obvious. When a committee appears to be going beyond its mandate, I believe the House leadership should take steps to re-calibrate the committee's focus to ensure that the committee stays within its mandate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942435">I am suggesting that this committee is on the verge of going rogue. In this particular case, the committee overruled its own chair. The chair believed that this motion and this field of study was beyond the committee's mandate, and ruled it that way. The committee members overruled the chair. That is what I am told. I believe this is a very clear case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942436">Just as another benchmark, the procedure and House affairs committee, which does have a mandate to look at the Canada Elections Act and financing and fundraising of political parties, is currently doing a study on the issue of political party fundraising. So it is not as though the issue of political party fundraising is not covered in the Standing Orders. It is very clearly part of the mandate of the procedure and House affairs committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942437">I am going to ask you, Mr. Speaker, to either make a ruling on this for the guidance of the House and the committee or, in collaboration with the House leaders or the members of the committee, effect some form of reconsideration of their decision to embark on this particular field of study simply for the purpose of following the rules of the House which are fairly flexible but clear, in this case. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942438">I think your guidance to the committee would be very helpful in allowing the committee to get on and do the work it is supposed to be doing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="942440">Mr. Speaker, I am very sorry that I do not. It is not something that appears to have happened a great deal. I must say I have not spent hours and hours of research, but I did take a look at the usual sources and did not find this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942441">It would seem to me to be pretty obvious. If we simply follow the wording in Marleau and Montpetit, which attempts to package all of the historic precedents, we follow here in the House a rule of law and a committee has to stay within its mandate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942442"> In this particular case, should the committee embark without a mandate, it would be in keeping for a person invited or summoned to the committee to simply say, “I am sorry, I do not hear you, Mr. Committee Chair because you are operating outside your mandate. You are rogue. You are not following the rule of law. I might just as well respond to a television reporter than respond to a committee that is clearly operating outside its mandate”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942443">I will accept any reasonable linkage of the mandate to this particular study, and I am sure, Mr. Speaker, you would too. I am sorry that I just do not have a really useful bang-on precedent that would serve at this point.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="78960" Type="18">Mr. Tom Lukiwski (Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons and Minister for Democratic Reform, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="942444">Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for revisiting a point of order that was first raised yesterday by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78477" Type="2">Mississauga South</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942445">I would like to reiterate some of the arguments that I presented yesterday. The overriding issue is that there has been a long standing practice in this place for the Speaker not to interfere with the business of any individual committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942446">Committees themselves, as you well know, Mr. Speaker, are masters of their own fate and of their own agenda. I would suggest even further to that, when my hon. colleague suggested they are exceeding their mandate, he is in fact asking you to prejudge, before this committee has even demonstrated a linkage to its mandate with this issue, and trying to stop this investigation from happening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942447">Clearly, the official opposition has some fears perhaps about an examination of its own advertising practices and its own books, and perhaps this is why it is trying to quash the motion right now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942448">I would point out that if in fact it did not have a difficulty with this, it would have accepted the motion from the procedure and House affairs committee in which the Conservative Party, the government, had suggested that a thorough examination of all political parties and their advertising practices, fundraising included, be engaged, but the opposition party has rejected that motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942449">It seems slightly disingenuous for any member from the party opposite to suggest that they have nothing against the motion but perhaps it is just in the wrong committee because it exceeds the mandate of one committee when it should rightfully be within the purview and the mandate of another committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942450">They have rejected the procedure and House affairs committee's motion to do exactly what the ethics committee is attempting to do. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942451">Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would point out to you that there have been many times in the past where there has been an overlap of responsibility between committees. I think we all know for an example that some subject material could be examined in the defence committee or it also could be examined in the foreign affairs committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942452">There seems to be to me a very obvious linkage between ethical practices of political parties and their fundraising practices, as well as perhaps the procedure and House affairs committee that has a direct mandate to deal with this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942453">It seems to me perfectly legitimate for the ethics committee to engage in this motion and study. I do not believe it is outside of its mandate, but more importantly, and I keep coming back to this, the primary issue here is whether or not the Speaker should be interfering with a decision made by committee members. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942454">I suggest to you, Mr. Speaker, that it is not appropriate for you to do so. It would be breaking a long standing tradition and practice of the Speaker not getting involved, and I think that is underscored by your very reasonable question to the hon. member as to precedence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942455">He has not been able to find any precedent, perhaps as he suggests because he has not done appropriate research, but I would suggest there are no real precedents and it would be a dangerous precedent to start if we now had the Speaker interfering in the business of committees.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="942458">Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="78587" Type="2">Don Valley East</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942459">I am proud to stand in the House to participate in today's debate on the government's budget. I represent the riding of <Affiliation DbId="78912" Type="2">Churchill</Affiliation>, which is a diverse and very large riding. It is over half the land mass of the province of Manitoba.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942460">As diverse and complex as Canada is as a nation, our federal budgets are often equally as comprehensive, or at least they should be. We have over 300 unique constituencies in Canada that require different services and programs due to regional, linguistic and many other considerations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942461">However, despite our vast geographic size, Canadians are united in the mutual understanding and appreciation of our differences. It is perhaps one of our greatest gifts and one of our greatest strengths.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942462">However, after a careful review of the government's budget, it is clear that the budget is not as comprehensive as it should be. It does not include the vision or needs of northern Manitoba and it is yet another lost opportunity to address the challenges and opportunities for Canada's first nations, the Métis nation and the Inuit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942463">In addition to the fall economic update, the budget demonstrates poor, long term fiscal planning, particularly with a potential U.S. recession, which, today, in one of our national newspapers, is being called a recession. It provides nothing to address poverty, housing and homelessness and it provides nothing for women's equality or for arts and culture. It provides no support for families in regard to early learning and child care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942464">I want to focus on a couple of items because I have such a short period of time for my speech. I want to discuss the fiscal planning. It is a bit outrageous that the current government inherited from the previous Liberal government a strong economic picture, consecutive balanced budgets and a surplus of $14 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942465"> Had the government been more careful in its previous budgets and its fall economic update, this budget could have addressed the urgent needs of many Canadian communities and families. However, the Conservatives spent all of the surplus and the cupboard is bare, with little focus on vulnerable communities and those most in need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942466"> It is of particular concern that the Conservatives' projected surplus of $2.3 billion for this year and $1.3 billion for next year are well below the $3 billion contingency fund that the Liberal opposition considers the bare minimum to cushion against unanticipated economic shock.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942467">As I said, given the current economic climate in the United States, which is facing a recession, it does not take an economist to understand how dangerous this is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942468">Moreover, the government lost an opportunity to address Canada's infrastructure deficit through acting on the Liberal proposal to use the $7 billion of this year's debt pay down to fund infrastructure projects across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942469">I would now like to touch on poverty and low income housing. It is troubling for ridings such as mine and it remains one of the most troubling issues in my riding. While in some communities multiple families are forced to reside together, some individuals and families, tragically, do not even have that option.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942470">Extreme poverty and homelessness continues to exist in the north and it is an element that the budget has once again overlooked. In a country as rich as Canada, it is completely unacceptable. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="35">(1035)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="942471"> However, implementing the housing initiatives alone will not tackle the homelessness and the poverty that persists across the country. The Conservative budget does little to alleviate any of poverty's root causes. The only party with both the will and the capacity to actually implement a plan to tackle poverty is the Liberal Party of Canada. I am proud to say that this past year the leader of the official opposition announced a plan to reduce poverty. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942472">I will focus my remaining time on two things: first, the labour market needs of my riding and, second, the aboriginal community within my riding. Sixty-five per cent of the population of my riding of <Affiliation DbId="78912" Type="2">Churchill</Affiliation> is comprised of aboriginals and first nations people. We have over 30 first nations, dozens of Métis communities and very strong Métis locals. Again, aboriginal people have been left out of this federal budget.</ParaText>

The lack of substantial funding in the budget announcement for our people does nothing to promote healthy communities.

              <ParaText id="942478">I will not go on and reiterate the Kelowna accord and the commitments that the previous Liberal government made which amounted to $5 billion over five years in the areas of housing, health, education, economic development and governance capacity building. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942479">However, in terms of this budget, allocations have been made contingent upon tripartite agreements with the provinces. It is reprehensible that, given the strong financial picture, the government cannot find, not only within its legal responsibility and fiduciary obligation to first nations people, but in terms of an economic picture, the funds to help first nations people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942480">We have the largest growing demographic of any population in Canada. Fifty percent of aboriginal people, that is first nations, Métis and Inuit people, are under the age of 30. In pure economic terms, it would make economic sense to invest in aboriginal people in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942481">In terms of my riding, our primary industries include mining, forestry and hydroelectric power and they have labour demands. In 2006, mineral production in northern Manitoba was valued at $2.1 billion. Some of our mining companies have a combined generated revenue of over $1.2 billion. With the continued strength in metal prices, we look to labour market partnership agreements to ensure that we can contribute to the economy.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="942498">Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my constituents of Don Valley East, I am pleased to rise today to provide my comments on the Conservatives' federal budget introduced last week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942499">I am an accountant by trade and I like to compare numbers, especially when it comes to tax policy. I was therefore surprised when the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> seemed particularly sensitive to the criticism that he and the Conservative Party are “blowing the surplus”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942500">Usually a budget speech delivered by a federal finance minister is a well crafted and dignified message intended to assure not only Canadians but also financial markets at home and around the world that the Government of Canada is in full control of its finances and confident of its economic future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942501">The fact that the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> found it necessary to fend off critics even before he outlined his budget plan suggests that he is not confident of his numbers and that the prospect of the Conservatives running a deficit is a very real and distinct possibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942502">Budget 2008 is the third budget delivered by the Conservatives. After three kicks at the can, one might expect the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> to have a better grip on the country's finances and purse strings. Yet, he continues to make some historical gaffes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942503">For example, I think Canadians will agree that the first disaster was the income trust scandal. Page 32 of the 2006 Conservative election platform entitled “Stand up for Canada” clearly states that a Conservative government would not attack retirement savings by ensuring that it would not impose any more taxes on them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942504">What is the first thing the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> did on October 31, 2006, barely six months after assuming office? He shocked thousands of Canadian investors, many of them seniors who relied on their income trusts for monthly income, by imposing a tax, breaking a campaign promise and wiping out more than $25 billion in savings overnight. Those seniors have not forgotten that, nor have they forgiven the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>, and I do not think they ever will.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942505">Another jewel in the Conservative misstep in its platform was to enshrine property rights in the Constitution of Canada, which it has conveniently dropped. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942506">The Conservatives like sound bites, but these sound bites are not intelligent bites and so the Conservatives have had to flip-flop constantly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942507">On page 16 of the Conservative election platform under the heading, “Real tax relief for Canadians”, it states, “A Conservative government will...eliminate the capital gains tax for individuals on the sale of assets when the proceeds” are delivered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942508">Canadians have been patiently waiting for years, and while the Conservatives have delivered three budgets, there is absolutely no mention of capital gains relief. Could it be that the Conservatives have broken yet another campaign promise?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942509">Canadians are beginning to literally stand up and take notice. Last year the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> made history with his 2007 budget that came along with the curious title of “Aspire”. It was the most inflationary budget and the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> was called the “biggest spending finance minister since Confederation”, by whom? By none other than Andrew Coyne, who at the time was with the <I>National Post</I>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942510">This year budget 2008 is entitled “Responsible Leadership”. Let us see what sort of leadership it is. The Conservative government inherited from the previous Liberal government a $17 billion federal surplus and now, in less than three years, the Conservatives have placed the country dangerously close to a federal deficit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942511">Let us look back at the economic situation 15 years ago. In 1993 the Liberal government inherited a $42 billion deficit and a massive federal debt from the Conservative government of Brian Mulroney. It took many painful years to turn the situation around and put Canada back on the path of prosperity. Part of the plan included a guarantee that no less than $3 billion a year would be taken from the surplus and used to pay down the federal debt.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="50">(1050)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="942512">Now the finance minister is telling us that he can no longer afford to pay off the debt in a balanced and predictable way. According to his predictions, he can only afford to pay $2.3 billion in 2008-09 and even less, $1.3 billion, in 2009-10. Is this what the Conservatives call responsible leadership?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942513">The reason the Conservatives' debt reduction plan gradually decreased is precisely that the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4"> finance minister</Affiliation> has in fact blown the surplus. As my distinguished colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78387" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation> has astutely pointed out, a $1.3 billion margin puts Canada perilously close to deficit financing. It takes a crisis like SARS or an ice storm to blow off this surplus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942514"> How could the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4"> finance minister</Affiliation> be so negligent? Canadians worked hard to get the country back on solid economic footing, and the finance minister and the Conservative government have spent like drunken sailors with nothing to show for it except a potential deficit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942515">To illustrate how incompetent the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4"> finance minister</Affiliation> is, let us look at a practical example. In 2006 the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4"> finance minister</Affiliation> cut the GST by 1% despite advice from economists all across the country that this was a foolish move. Then, to add insult to injury, he increased the income tax rate from 15% to 15.5% for the lowest income bracket and reduced the personal exemption rate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942516">For people in low and middle income brackets, the effect of the tax increase that these people lost was anywhere from $122 to $400. For the same people to take advantage of the GST cut, the low and middle income earners would have to spend $12,200 or $40,000. This is bizarre. The only people who could benefit from the GST cut are the wealthy ones.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942517"> Instead of helping the most deserving, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4"> finance minister</Affiliation> penalizes them, at a time when the federal treasury had $17 billion in surplus. Why did the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4"> finance minister</Affiliation> squander away federal reserves without even stimulating the economy? Each 1% cut of the GST costs the federal treasury $6 billion a year, and since the Conservatives came to office, they have cut the GST twice, creating a federal shortfall of $12 billion a year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942518">Who pays for the shortfall? The Canadian taxpayer does, especially when the same economists have repeatedly told the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4"> finance minister</Affiliation> that personal income tax cuts like the ones introduced by previous Liberal governments do far more for the economy than saving one or two cents on a cup of coffee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942519">Personal income taxes, especially those aimed at low and middle income taxpayers, do more for the economy because Canadians save money before tax. With more money at their disposal, low and middle income Canadians will likely spend or invest that money on their own behalf, therefore stimulating the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942520">Budget 2008 is a bare-bones budget. Of the $22 billion it projects as expenditures, only $1.4 billion is new money. This is smoke and mirrors. The money for infrastructure, claimed to be $33 billion over seven years, is really less than $4 billion because the other money has been there from the cities and communities agenda and a gas tax rebate introduced in the Liberal budget 2004-05.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942521">The Conservative government lacks economic savvy, lacks vision, lacks leadership. The fact is Old Mother Hubbard has gone to the cupboard and found it bare. The Conservatives have blown the surplus and unfortunately, we the Canadian taxpayers will have to suffer the consequences. History repeats itself. Conservative times are deficit times and Conservative times are sorry times.</ParaText>

It requires leadership; it requires vision; and it requires the commitment of government to move forward with the people. The people in 1993 realized that. This is why they booted out the Conservatives, because they were such terrible economic managers. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="942533"> As the member for <Affiliation DbId="78419" Type="2">Montmorency—Charlevoix—Haute-Côte-Nord</Affiliation>, it is a pleasure for me to speak to this budget, on which the final vote will take place tonight in the House of Commons. I would simply like to reiterate the traditional position developed by the Bloc Québécois on a series of issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942534"> Our leader said clearly, before the budget was introduced, that if it met the needs, priorities and expectations of Quebeckers, then the Bloc Québécois, in its role as advocate for Quebec in Ottawa, would vote for it, and that otherwise, the Bloc Québécois would vote against the budget, regardless of what position the other two opposition parties took, and whether those members were present or absent for the votes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942535"> That is what we have done. Last night, in the vote on the Liberal amendment, with two exceptions, all of my Bloc Québécois colleagues were present. We will take exactly the same approach tonight. The Bloc Québécois will vote against this budget unless there is a major reversal and there are significant gains for Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942536"> The leader of the Bloc Québécois, speaking for its members in the House, clearly stated the terms on which this budget would be supported. One of the things they called for was significant progress for Quebec on the economy, post-secondary education, housing, social justice, the environment and culture. Our basic premise was that the Conservatives, with the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> in the lead, were patting themselves on the back about having a $12.6 billion surplus for this fiscal year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942537"> Our opinion was, and we are still convinced, that the Conservative government has the resources to agree to the reasonable and realistic demands of the Bloc Québécois. However, one of the things this government prefers to do is put all its extra cash towards the debt and that is what will be done with the surplus. It is not that we are opposed to reducing the debt. We have to reduce the debt, but we have to reduce it proportionately. There should be something paid toward reducing the debt, but also some substantial amount put toward improving certain programs and dealing with major crises we are currently experiencing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942538"> In my last few minutes, I would like to come back to two crises, and in particular the crisis in the manufacturing and forestry sectors. I would note, by the way, that the riding I represent here in the House of Commons has been hard hit by the forestry crisis. And second, we have to address the entire question of improving employment insurance. In the riding I represent there are a lot of seasonal workers, and under the current scheme they cannot qualify for employment insurance. Here we are in early March, and before operations start back up in May, seasonal workers will have to get through what is called the spring gap, because the number of benefit weeks is insufficient to cover the time until operations resume. That is why the Bloc Québécois called for the employment insurance scheme to be improved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942539"> However, as I said, this government opted to put all its extra cash towards the debt and to continue reducing taxes paid by the big oil companies, which just go on cheating us. I do not know what the gas price situation is in every riding, but I am certain that all my colleagues must be hearing about rising gas prices when they meet their constituents in the grocery store or the corner store or elsewhere.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="05">(1105)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="942540"> We are literally being strangled by the big oil companies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942541"> This government also has its approach to military expenditures. I should say in passing that the Bloc Québécois is not opposed to the troops. When we criticize the Conservative government’s military expenditures or its position on Afghanistan, we are immediately told that we are against the troops. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942542"> I am sorry, but in the Quebec City area, the Valcartier military base consists mostly of Quebeckers and I want to say again that the Bloc Québécois is very proud of soldiers from Quebec. We can have differences of opinion, though, on the government’s approach to Afghanistan. This is very evident if we just remember that since the Conservative government came to power, it has spent $17 billion on military equipment: tanks, jeeps, aircraft and ships. We know very well that there are a lot of other priorities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942543"> I am running out of time and want to make sure in my remarks on the budget to draw attention to the crisis in manufacturing and especially in forestry. I was very disappointed as well with the billion dollars that the government announced in January and that we passed at the end of the month. Contrary to what the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had said, the funds were tied to the budget passing. Finally he realized that it did not make any sense to hold working people hostage by tying the billion dollars to the passage of the budget. Thanks to all the hard work put in by the Bloc members and the premiers of certain provinces, including Quebec and Ontario, the Conservative government finally listened to reason and no longer made the billion dollars conditional on the budget passing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942544"> In five years we have seen 150,000 jobs lost, most of them in the last two years since the Conservatives came to power. This government does not seem aware of the full extent of the crisis in the manufacturing and forestry sectors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942545"> The most striking evidence of this is the fact that the billion dollars could have been increased in the budget, as the Bloc was demanding, because the method the Conservatives chose to calculate the amounts is unfair to Quebec. It will get only about $217 million for both its manufacturing and forestry sectors even though it accounts for nearly 33% of the forestry industry in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942546"> We feel that it is totally unfair to base these amounts on a formula that treats all the provinces equally. Some provinces are less affected. I cannot believe that Prince Edward Island will get a standard $10 million payment, because its forestry sector is less affected than Quebec’s, which accounts for almost 33% of the forestry industry in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942547"> I am being signalled that my time is running out and just wanted to finish by saying we would have expected improvements to the employment insurance system because it is ineffective and ill suited to seasonal workers who suffer job losses year after year. That is certainly not by choice. I meet these seasonal workers in my office all the time. If it were possible to fish all year long or work in the forest industry or the tourism industry all year long, these people would rather work all year long. </ParaText>

Members of the Bloc Québécois and the Liberal Party kept asking them to do something for seniors. Because of that pressure, the Conservatives finally were forced into doing something, and they put some money forward.

              <ParaText id="942551">Mr. Speaker, my colleague is talking about the situation with older workers. One of the things the Bloc Québécois wanted was an assistance program for older workers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942552">In reality, when a worker aged 55 and up loses his job, he is essentially forced to turn to social assistance. It is not easy for someone over 55 to find a new job. We hear simplistic comments, like the ones from the member for <Affiliation DbId="78609" Type="2">Jonquière—Alma</Affiliation>, who told workers in his region affected by the forestry crisis and workers from the CSN that all they had to do was go work in Alberta. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said the exact same thing to unemployed workers in the Maritimes, telling them to go work in Alberta, where there is a labour shortage. But it is not so easy to split up or uproot a family or a community.</ParaText>

In fact, had this budget been tabled in Quebec's National Assembly rather than in this House, not one single member would have voted for it, and all 125 would have voted against. Clearly, Canadian federalism is limiting Quebeckers' freedom to act in their own best interest and preventing them from choosing how they want to spend their own tax dollars. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="942560">Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to rise here today to speak to the budget. I will likely be less eloquent and impassioned that my hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78419" Type="2">Montmorency—Charlevoix—Haute-Côte-Nord</Affiliation>, but my comments are equally relevant. I am pleased to join the budget debate and add a few remarks concerning the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942561">I would remind the House that this government had a surplus of more than $10 billion in its coffers for the current year. Among the demands of the Bloc Québécois, as my colleagues have already pointed out, we were calling for significant assistance for the manufacturing and forestry industries. We also wanted our seniors to be reimbursed the money that the government literally stole from them by refusing to make the guaranteed income supplement fully retroactive. Furthermore, we think that it is essential that there be assistance for the environment. With this budget, we called on the government to make a 180-degree turn and invest $1 billion in the environment. After carefully reading this budget, however, we are left dissatisfied.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942562">This budget leaves something to be desired. First of all, we would have expected this government to invest heavily in renewable energy. We would have liked to see the $1 billion we were calling for help make household appliances more energy efficient, for instance, thereby contributing to the fight against climate change, which must be approached from two angles. It must first be addressed by reducing greenhouse gas emissions at the source, but also by ensuring that we have energy efficiency programs in order to curb our oil dependency. These programs were therefore very important to us. Unfortunately, the government did not meet our expectations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942563">In terms of the environment, the government and the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> first announced $66 million over two years to develop its regulatory framework. I am referring to the so-called plan to fight climate change that was announced by the <Affiliation DbId="105835" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation>. From our perspective, there is no way we can support a budget that allocates financial resources to a framework that we oppose. I would remind the House that this regulatory framework aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions uses 2006 as the reference year in establishing the reduction targets for industrial emitters. We believe, however, that the only valid reference is that used by the Kyoto protocol, namely, 1990.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942564">Our businesses have made efforts in the past. They have reduced their greenhouse gas emissions by more than 7% or 8%. This regulatory framework would not take into consideration improvements that have already been made to industrial processes to make the business more energy efficient and to contribute to the fight against greenhouse gases, nor the fact that these companies are more productive. The link between the environment and the economy will always be there. However, the government chose to ignore it by designating 2006 as the reference year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942565">Second, by adopting intensity targets for greenhouse gas emissions, we are telling companies that emission reductions will be considered with respect to each unit of production. That means that targets and greenhouse gas reductions will be imposed, but only per production unit. In view of the fact that oil sands production is expected to increase fourfold or fivefold by 2015, Canada will not achieve absolute reductions but instead will record considerable increases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942566">We cannot support a budget that allocates $66 million to a regulatory framework that is unfair and that will not contribute to Canada's effort and responsibility in the international fight against climate change.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="942567">In addition, we also cannot approve this budget because, in essence, it grants $300 million to Canada's nuclear industry. Imagine that. In recent weeks we have seen the difficulties—and witnessed the bickering—associated with the departure of the president of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. Now the government is announcing that it is allocating $300 million to the nuclear industry, without any prior public debate on the issue. It is as though the government, in its budget, is telling us that it is beginning to change Canada's position on energy without even discussing it with Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942568"> We have to shed some light on the growth of this industry, which is continuing to create negative externalities. I will cite one: nuclear waste management, an issue we have not yet come to grips with. At present, the pools are overflowing with waste in the provinces, and we have not found any sustainable solution to that waste. And at the same time, our federal government is setting aside and increasing funding for an industry that creates externalities. We understand, of course, why the government is making this choice, because we know that there are projects in western Canada to expand oil sands production using nuclear energy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942569"> We therefore cannot support a budget that gives the nuclear industry $300 million, when there has been no public debate and no debate in the House on this important issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942570"> There is another factor: $250 million has been allocated to carbon storage, for what is called “capture” and “sequestration” of carbon. That means that we are increasing and expanding our assistance to a polluting industry, an industry that makes enormous profits, by giving it $250 million for a pilot project in Saskatchewan to capture GHGs. Through absolute, mandatory targets and the establishment of a carbon exchange that would allow businesses to trade emissions credits freely, the oil industry and the oil sands industry in Canada could contribute to funding that project in Saskatchewan. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942571"> At the end of December 2008 the government also decided to cancel the ecoAUTO rebate program, that is designed to encourage the purchase of low energy consumption vehicles. It is a program that the public was expecting. Several months were put into implementing the program, and the government is now telling us that it is eliminating it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942572"> To conclude, what this budget promotes is the polluter-paid principle rather than the polluter-pay principle. These are large figures. I mentioned the $300 million given to the nuclear industry and the $250 million given to the big industrial emitters for carbon capture. What this budget does is benefit oil companies and polluters, at the expense of a sustainable economy that has to be built on value added, which the renewable energy industry is. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942573"> We would have expected incentives for wind and solar energy production, but no, there is nothing. The choice made gives preference to friends in western Canada. There is nothing for Quebec. And there is $250 million in assistance going directly to the auto industry. In terms of the Canadian economy, the west is benefiting through assistance to the oil industry, central Ontario is getting incentives through aid to the auto industry, but there is nothing for Quebec.</ParaText>

The member for <Affiliation DbId="79025" Type="2">Western Arctic</Affiliation> and members of the Bloc seem to be criticizing carbon capture. Climate change is devastating us the north. We certainly want to get that carbon out of the atmosphere. We want to make sure that when oil companies are forced by regulations to reduce carbon the technology is available.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942575">However, I would like the hon. member to comment on what environmentalists have told me, which is that the government has cut over 100 programs that were in existence under the previous government. He mentioned some of them, including the renewable energy program and the EnerGuide. The government has either cut them or reintroduced them with less money and tougher restrictions. A good example of that is the EnerGuide program. There is less money and it is very hard to access. A lot of people have told us it is not even worth it any more, so I imagine the statistics are terrible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942576">Could the member comment on the reduction in programs that help the environment by reducing greenhouse gases, et cetera, and on the government renaming them and making them harder to access?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="942578">First of all, we are not opposed to the notion of the oil industry using new technologies for carbon capture and sequestration. However, should the public be the ones to pay for the testing of such technologies, through taxes and income tax, while the petroleum industry earns exorbitant profits? Rather, it should be up to the industry to invest in those technologies in order to ensure real greenhouse gas reductions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942579">Second, to answer the hon. member's second question, we definitely believe in energy efficiency programs. That is why we asked that $1 billion from this year's $10.3 billion surplus be allocated to the environment, specifically to the various energy efficiency programs that are producing results, contrary to the Conservatives' claims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942580">We definitely believe in energy efficiency and, furthermore, we believe in reducing greenhouse gas emissions at the source.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="942581">Mr. Speaker, I listened with much interest to the member's speech. However, it is important to note that for the past two years, the Bloc Québécois has supported all the Conservative government's budgets. It supported the 2006 and 2007 budgets. Even though the measures in these budgets were in no way taken in the interests of Quebeckers, the Bloc always supported the Conservative government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942582">Now, we know that the Liberals are supporting the Conservatives and that the Bloc is finally siding with the NDP. This is good, because it shows that the Bloc is acting in the interests of Quebeckers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942583">Given that the Bloc now supports the NDP position and is opposed to the Conservative government, I would like to ask the member for <Affiliation DbId="78641" Type="2">Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie</Affiliation> a question. Is the Bloc ready now to reconsider supporting the Conservative government on the softwood lumber issue?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942584">The softwood lumber agreement cost Quebeckers thousands of jobs, and Quebec was harder hit than any other part of the country.

              <ParaText id="942593">I think it is important that I start out today by congratulating Premier Stelmach on his crushing victory last night in Alberta. As an Albertan, it is important for me to acknowledge that. It is particularly exciting to see him not only go way beyond expectations but reduce the official opposition to a fraction of what it was. I believe the official opposition was and is the Liberal Party. I am sure my friends across the way will not be very excited about that, but those are the facts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942594">It is important as we talk about budget 2008 that we place it in context. Today in Canada these are good times. The economy in Canada is strong. Jobs are being created. Taxes are going down. The budget is balanced. Our national mortgage, the debt, is being paid down. All of these are very good things. People have reason to be confident.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="942595">Canadians have reason to feel confident about the future. Our financial situation is more stable than that of any other G-7 country, and the government is showing leadership at home and abroad thanks to its long term economic plan, Advantage Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="942596">Obviously, in this country today Canadians generally are doing extraordinarily well. That does not mean there are no big challenges in some sectors, but given some of the struggles we see in other parts of the world and certainly south of the border in the United States these days, these are good times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942597">However, we cannot take that for granted. That is why the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> moved last fall to lower taxes to get ahead of some of the problems he saw coming in the United States. That is why we are paying down debt and being prudent in our spending. But when we do spend, we spend with an eye to making sure that this country can compete today and go forward. I want to talk a bit about some of those investments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942598">I am the Minister of Human Resources and Social Development and I am very proud of some of the changes that we made in budget 2008. I want to talk about some of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942599">One of the most important things that any country can do is make sure it has an educated workforce. We have that in Canada today substantially, but we must do more. We face great competition around the world, so therefore it is incumbent upon us to do everything we can to make sure our workforce is ready to compete. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942600">That is why in the last budget we invested heavily in training. Today, we invest more in training than any government in history. It is also why we increased funding for post-secondary education, colleges and universities, by 40% in a single year. That is $800 million. We are not resting on our laurels either. That is why in this budget we said we must do more than we do today to encourage students to enter post-secondary education. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942601">Seventy per cent of all the new jobs that are being created require some post-secondary education. Today, we are not getting enough people into post-secondary education. We believe that one of the reasons why is that some of the tools we have in place today just are not encouraging people to take the step of going into post-secondary education, particularly knowing how expensive colleges and universities can be. We have made some important changes to encourage people to take those steps.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942602">We are dissolving the Canada millennium scholarship foundation and replacing it with up front and predictable grants. These are called Canada student grants. They will encourage low and middle income Canadians to go into post-secondary education because if they are from a particular income group, apply and are admitted into post-secondary education, they will be eligible without respect for where they live in this country or what program they are going into, whether it is college or university.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942603">Under the old program, the access grants, they did not get that. They did not get it under the CMSF. They will get it up front under these new grants. They will apply every year students are in undergraduate studies, whether it be in college or university, ensuring that people will have a lot of funding going their way to help deal with the problem of expensive tuition costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942604">There will be $250 a month for low income people for every month that they are in university or college. There will be $100 a month for middle income people. We noted in the Speech from the Throne that today many middle income families struggle with the high cost of post-secondary education. It is our commitment to make sure that we start to deal with that very difficult problem for many Canadian families and we are proud of some of the changes that we are making.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942605">By the way, this will touch a lot of people. Under the previous regime, the way it was established, the various types of support in the form of bursaries and grants touched only 140,000 people a year. The new initiative will touch 245,000 people every year and we are very proud of that. We believe that will encourage many low and middle income families who otherwise felt they could not afford it to take the step and go into post-secondary education.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942606">We have made other important changes as well. One of the criticisms we have received is that student loan financing was very complicated. We did a survey of people who were involved in this sector and we talked to students, educators and families. They told us the system was far too complicated. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="942607">We have taken that to heart, so in addition to taking the previous six grants and boiling them down to one, the Canada student grant, and getting them to students who go to school, no matter whether college or university, we have also made changes that will allow students to go on and manage their student loan via one account. This is what we are working toward with the provinces. The provinces are very excited about it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942608">Up until now it has been extraordinarily complicated, Byzantine, when people attempt to get a student loan. We are going to simplify it and make it much simpler for students, so that they will be able to go online ultimately and manage their entire account, both provincial and federal, through one window. We think that will be a real step forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942609">One of the other criticisms we received is that there are about 20% of students who, when they apply for a student loan, have trouble paying back the loan. Irrespective of the reason, this has been a real burden for thousands of students over the years. The changes we have made will make it possible for students to finally get out from underneath those loans and to make it possible for them to repay them in a way that is much more realistic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942610">For instance, we are now going to make sure that we attach the amount of student loan they pay back to their income. These student loan repayments will be sensitive to the income and will never exceed a certain percentage. This will be extraordinarily helpful to people like medical students who have complained for a long time rightfully that we are penalizing them for going into an expensive program and ultimately then we turn around and complain about the fact that we do not have enough people becoming doctors. We are fixing that and I am proud of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942611">I want to speak for a moment about the guaranteed income supplement. We have made changes so that earned income will be exempted from the current $500 to $3,500, meaning that seniors can go out and earn income and will not have their benefits clawed back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942612">I want to acknowledge the work that the member for <Affiliation DbId="78373" Type="2">Wild Rose</Affiliation> has done on this issue. He told me the story of someone from his riding who really could not go to work, help out in the labour force, and look after herself without losing those benefits. He pushed for this for a long time. I am very proud that we were able to introduce this in the budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942613">I also want to make one final point to the important changes we have made to employment insurance financing. We have created an arm's length corporation that will make it impossible for future governments to rip-off the EI fund, like the Liberals did when they were in power, when they ripped off over $50 billion from workers. That will never happen again. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942614">We have preserved the ability of Parliament and the government to look after benefits and that will not change, but never again will the Liberals be able to rip-off employment insurance like they have in the past. We are proud of those changes.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="942628">Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support the budget delivered by my colleague, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, on February 26. I believe this budget demonstrates responsible leadership from a government that continues to be vigilant and smart about how it spends the taxpayers' money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942629"> Across the government, my ministerial colleagues are working hard to deliver programs to meet the needs of Canadians effectively and efficiently. My job as President of the Treasury Board is to strive for excellence across the government in the way programs, operations, and spending are managed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942630">As part of this effort, we announced our new expenditure management system in budget 2007. In budget 2008 we announced some of these results. In this initial year of strategic reviews, 17 organizations of government participated and assessed their program spending to ensure that it is aligned with the priorities of Canadians and delivers value for money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942631"> We examined departmental spending amounting to $13.6 billion, or 15% of total direct program spending, and that was essentially in the half-year from June to December of 2007. As a result, these departments have identified savings totalling some $386 million per year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942632">This means that we are reallocating from within to fund new initiatives, both inside departments and for the broader priorities of the budget. This is how the new system is ensuring that all federal programs are effective and efficient, provide value for money and are aligned with the priorities of Canadians and federal responsibilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942633">With this new system, we are transforming how we manage tax dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942634"> Over the last number of years, there has been a huge increase in the government's discretionary program spending, but no appropriate way to ensure that what was being spent was giving taxpayers full value for their money. This spending grew from $63 billion in 2000-2001 to $83 billion in 2004-2005. That is a 33% increase overall, equal to an ongoing increase of $2,200 a year for a family of four.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942635">A renewal of the existing system was needed to improve decision making, promote excellence in the management of tax dollars and help control the growth of government spending. That is why we introduced this new expenditure management system. This system is built on three pillars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942636">First is managing for results: we evaluate our programs and demonstrate results for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942637">Second is upfront discipline: all new proposals for government spending require clear measures of success and better information about how the new proposals fit among the existing programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942638">Third is ongoing assessment: conducting strategic reviews of all direct spending to ensure that the programs funded are efficient, effective and aligned with the priorities of Canadians and with federal responsibilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942639">The strategic reviews cover all direct program spending and the operating costs of major statutory programs. With these reviews, all government spending will go through a systematic and rigorous examination on a four year cycle. This is not an ad hoc exercise but a new way of doing business, so that over a four year cycle all existing spending in our organizations is subject to an in-depth assessment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942640">Now, for the first time, and I cannot stress that often enough, the Government of Canada is in a position to decide on new proposals by taking into account the broader picture of other existing spending in the same area. That was the difficulty about bringing in new programs earlier: one did not know what money was being spent on related programs or indeed what related programs were accomplishing. This is a major advance over what was done before. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="942641">Five years ago, for example, we could not say how many federal programs we had for aboriginal people. In fact, two years ago, it took us seven months to actually count up the number of programs serving aboriginal people. For members' information, we have 360 programs in that respect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942642">Now, with this new approach, when a new program proposal goes to cabinet for consideration, ministers will have access to better results and performance information for existing programs and will know the full extent of the associated costs of those programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942643"> Cabinet is then able to determine how the newly proposed program and associated funding will fit within the existing program and funding framework. It can then decide if the new program is required, based on how it will deliver on the priorities of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942644">Included with the new program proposal are measures of success. These measures enable the program to be evaluated to determine if it is producing results and in fact providing good value to Canadians. This new system ensures that we can help Canadians meet their evolving needs effectively and efficiently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942645">It has the effect of ensuring that every tax dollar Canadians send to Ottawa is spent on high-priority and high-performing programs. With these improvements, Canadians now have better information to hold the government to account for the management of these tax dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942646"> This is simply good management. It is really no different from what Canadian families do when they make sure that as a family they are spending money efficiently, meeting their own shifting priorities within their household, keeping their finances on track and, of course, living within their means. It is also providing more tangible evidence that business is being done differently in Ottawa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942647">By reducing spending on ineffective or inefficient programs and stopping programs that do not work, our government is ensuring that taxpayers' money is being spent where it performs best. In this way, we are aligning resources with priorities and helping to control the overall growth of spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942648">This government will not waste taxpayers' hard-earned money. We want to spend it effectively and efficiently on programs that provide value and results to Canadians. Unlike the New Democrats and the Liberals, I actually believe that giving Canadians back their money, which they have paid to government, is not a waste of money, and that in fact allowing ordinary hard-working Canadians to keep more money in their pockets is one of the best ways that we can spend money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942649">The government has made tremendous progress in moving to a more disciplined approach to managing tax dollars to meet the priorities of Canadians so that we can meet essential social needs as well as keep more money in Canadians' pockets. Ongoing strategic reviews are a part of this approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942650">That is what responsible leadership is all about. It is about making better spending decisions. It is about making tax dollars deliver results. It is about keeping the average rate of growth in government spending below the rate of growth in the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942651">This, I would submit, is responsible leadership. It is good management. It is important. It is good government. This is now the norm for how things get done in Ottawa.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="942653">Mr. Speaker, I cannot emphasize how important it is to pay down the debt and give Canadians their money back. Many Canadians do not realize what it means in terms of money that was saved on an ongoing basis when we paid down that first $13 billion or so of debt. I cannot remember the exact amount of money we paid down on the debt, but we saved approximately $1 billion in interest costs. That was over the course of one year, and it will go on for every year in perpetuity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942654">When we pay down $30 billion, $40 billion, $50 billion, look at the interest we are saving.

              <ParaText id="942655">The Liberals and the New Democrats want to drive us into spending more money and ignoring the debt.

              <ParaText id="942666">The sad reality is the budget will likely be one of the least memorable in recent federal history. Its most glitzy tax cutting measure was the $5,000 a year savings account with interest accruing tax free. Over time, it may assist some wealthy seniors in meeting their ongoing savings needs, particularly after age 71 when they are required to begin drawing down their RRSPs. However, it is still a pale response to the income trust debacle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942667">The savings account will be of no assistance to low and middle income earners, including many young families and seniors who cannot afford the luxury of savings. The amount of interest earned at today's rates will be pennies in any event. On the other hand, with a slowing economy, additional spending by Canadians would help to stimulate the economy. This is a short-sighted program for our current economic conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942668">Speaking in general terms, the budget is a hodgepodge of very low dollar spending initiatives, with no apparent theme or direction: 58 spending initiatives in total with 55 of these being less than the cost of a federal election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942669"> In 2006 the Conservatives inherited the largest surplus and the best economy in Canadian history. Now after two years and a few budgets and economic updates, they have spent it all and moved the country, once again, to the brink of deficit spending. The Conservatives must like living on the edge, as the country returns to Mulroney economics, something that the Liberals will never do when we return to government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942670"> The story in the budget, however, is what is not mentioned. Let us talk about the crisis in manufacturing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942671">Canada's economy is hurting badly. Ontario's is hurting worse and Niagara's economy is worse yet. A St. Catharines-Thorold Chamber of Commerce report on manufacturing in Niagara notes that currently manufacturing accounts for 14% of Niagara's economy, down from 29% over the past two decades. Niagara's overall employment growth has been less than 1% since 2000. This average places Niagara near the bottom of the province in statistics related to full time employment rates and employment income levels in the province. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942672">What does the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> do? He tells all the world that Ontario is the last place in which business would invest. In public comments made earlier this week, the Minister of Finance claimed Ontario's manufacturing industry was suffering because the province faced the highest corporate tax rates in Canada. However, the minister's claim is nothing but a distortion of reality. Only four provinces have lower corporate tax rates than Ontario for manufacturers and processors. In terms of attracting new investment, the nearest competing U.S. states, including Michigan and New York, face corporate tax rates 12% higher than Ontario's and Ontario continues to lower the tax rates.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942673">The budget's paltry support for the manufacturing sector has prompted the Canadian Manufacturers &amp; Exporters, in frustration, to explain that it has received only recycled ideas and pocket change at a critical time when it needs tangible solutions. Out of a $6 billion budget, manufacturing received $150 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942674">In my region health care remains one of the major areas of concern. Physicians lobbying on Parliament Hill today will tell us that there are five million Canadians without a family doctor, that England has twice as many physicians per capita than we do, that we have over 4,000 medical students training outside our country because there are insufficient spaces in our medical schools and most of these will not come home to work, that we have foreign trained doctors within Canada who need assistance meeting our standards and that we have an aging doctor population leaning toward retirement. It is urgent that we address this. Our emergency room crisis, patient wait times and physician health care work shortages are all crying out for help. Sadly, there is none. Sadly, no one is listening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942675">There is nothing in the budget to address poverty and homelessness. A poverty report prepared by the region of Niagara stated that approximately one-third of visits to food banks in the Niagara region were made by children. In 2005 just over 4,000 households utilized 13 food banks across the Niagara region, and the situation continues to decline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942676">The Regional Municipality of Niagara owns or manages over 5,500 housing units that are subsidized, of which 2,200 are occupied by families whose average family income is $15,680. The poverty line for a family of four in the Niagara region is $27,500. The need for housing assistance is very high within Niagara. There were 4,000 households on the waiting list in June of 2006. The number of rental units has simply not kept pace with demand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942677">The huge negative impact of poverty and homelessness in my riding has been left to flounder and fester. The budget's silence was deafening. Nothing for the less fortunate in our society. Perhaps government members should visit a hostel, soup kitchen or food bank and look directly into the eyes and faces of those who cannot fend for themselves, for whatever reason. In the region of Niagara there is an urgent demand for homeless spaces. These figures are compounded across the country and the totals are staggering.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="05">(1205)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="942678">Surely the measure of our worth is diminished when we fail to take initiatives to help. Community-minded volunteer organizations, donors and churches are struggling under a terrible burden, but the government walks by, completely oblivious to the pain and suffering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942679">What have the Conservatives accomplished during their time? They have accomplished very little. They continue to spend while eroding the tax base. With economists across the country warning that cuts to the GST would be the worst tax cuts to consider, the Conservatives blundered ahead to reduce the GST by two percentage points, all for the sake of what they felt was politically astute for their party, not what was economically good for Canadians and the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942680">As the party that introduced the GST, perhaps the Conservatives felt guilty. They have a lot to feel guilty about, but such poor tax cuts are not the way to redemption. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942681">The Conservative child care program has not produced any new child care spaces that young couples and single parents so desperately need. The reality is it was simply a baby bonus program with no vision, no direction and no spaces. Young mothers and fathers were most appreciative of the money until they filed their income tax returns last spring and began to realize the Conservative child care program was all smoke and mirrors. This wonderful $100 a month per child is taxable. They are not pleased that they have been duped once again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942682">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has become the largest spending prime minister in Canadian history, and now the cupboard is bare. What did Canadians really get for it? Are they really better off? Canadians will send a resounding no in the next election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942683">As our biggest trading partner, the United States, continues to spiral into recession, our economy, so connected with them, continues to be pulled down. There is also the economic uncertainty of a high Canadian dollar and a retiring skilled workforce. Our country is heading into the perfect storm at a time when no one in the Conservative government is at the helm. Any shock to revenue or any unanticipated spending initiative will put Canada back into deficit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942684"> What has the government done to prepare the country for a possible economic downturn? It has done simply nothing. Are we surprised? We should not be. The <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4"> finance minister</Affiliation> drove the province of Ontario into deficit, all the while claiming a balanced budget as his Conservative government headed into a provincial election. The smile of the victorious McGuinty government soon turned sour when independent auditors discovered a huge deficit. So much for openness, transparency and accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942685">Canadians are very concerned that Conservatives have a projected surplus of $2.3 billion for this year and $1.3 billion for next year, which is well below the $3 billion contingency fund that Liberals consider the bare minimum to cushion against unanticipated economic shocks. It has been said that our country is one SARS crisis away from a deficit, and this is if one believes the Conservative projections are accurate. The <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4"> finance minister</Affiliation>'s prior track record of misrepresentation makes me and the entire country uncomfortable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942686"> Moreover, the Conservative government lost an opportunity to address Canada's infrastructure deficit by failing to act on the Liberals' proposal to use $7 billion from this year's surplus to fund infrastructure programs across the country. As municipalities beg for financial assistance to address the compelling infrastructure deficit, as bridges collapse and aging water treatment plants malfunction, the government plods blindly, seemingly oblivious, to the cries from our communities. Let us not forget the positive impact of well-paying construction jobs that infrastructure projects would have provided. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942687">Actually, the Liberal opposition should be flattered that many of the budget initiatives were driven by them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942688"> It was the Liberals who first created the gas tax transfer to municipalities in 2005 and pledged to make it permanent over a year ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942689"> It was the Liberals who advocated direct support to Canada's ailing auto industry. The Conservatives' $250 million over five years to provide research and development is simply a pittance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942690">It was the Liberals who committed to desperately needed improvements in public transit. Is a rail line from Peterborough to Toronto through vast tracts of agricultural lands and small hamlets our country's biggest priority? Is there enough potential passenger usage to make it financially viable?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942691">It was the Liberals who committed to funding to have more police across our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942692"> It was the Liberals who committed to improving cash flow, supporting livestock producers and providing direct payment for hog farmers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942693"> It was the Liberals who advocated reversing the Conservative government's previous cuts to university councils and research programs. It was the Liberals who urged the modernization of the Canada Student Loans Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942694">We are pleased the Conservatives are adopting prudent Liberal policies, but the insufficient funding, because of an ill-advised national debt payment, will detract from their effectiveness. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942695">I suggest the budget is a non-event, paying lip service to worthy causes such as the environment, students and crime, but by no means is it a green budget, an education budget or a law and order budget. There is no economic stimulus or poverty initiatives to help Welland riding. There is nothing of great substance. It is simply underwhelming. After two years, the Harper government has exhausted its legislative agenda and has lost its drive.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="942698">Mr. Speaker, I always like to hear the member for <Affiliation DbId="78608" Type="2">Welland</Affiliation>. He made a very passionate speech about how lousy the budget is for working families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942699">He had a lot of the same criticisms that the NDP has had about the budget. It essentially gives tons of money to the corporate sector. It does not provide the kinds of supports for working families that are needed. It does not provide a penny for affordable housing, the same way the former Liberal government did. I cannot but agree with his criticisms of the Conservative budget. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942700">Why oh why is the entire Liberal caucus supporting a budget that they have the nerve to stand in the House and condemn? It makes absolutely no sense. How can the <Affiliation DbId="105458" Type="9">leader of the Liberal Party</Affiliation> pretend to have the least bit of credibility when members of his caucus are standing in the House and criticizing a budget that they are supporting? It makes absolutely no sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942701">It is beyond belief that they think Canadians will be fooled by their speeches when they are supporting the budget. The least they could do is, like the Conservatives, say that corporate tax cuts are the be all and end all and that is all that the federal government should be doing; forget about housing; forget about child care; forget about any support for our manufacturing sector, which has been devastated. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942702">All that is available now basically are burger-flipping jobs and the Conservatives tend to say that we have more jobs. They know that those jobs are part time and temporary and are not family sustaining.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942703">Why do the Liberals not simply say either they are opposed to the budget and they will stand in the House and vote against it, or if they are voting for it, which is what their leader has said, they should just say that all that counts for them are corporate tax cuts. Why do they not just come clean with the Canadian public and say that they do not see any difference between the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party and that is why they are supporting the budget?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="942710">Mr. Speaker, that was a very insightful question. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942711">As I pointed out, the government has done nothing to address poverty and homelessness in our area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942712">The manufacturing sector in our region is on the decline and there is nothing in the budget to assist it.</ParaText>

There is nothing to help that sector, except $50 million each year over five years. That is a pittance. It is simply not enough to help this major industry that is really driving the Ontario economy, which drives the economy of our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942714">My friend mentioned the border. Under the Liberals we had an extensive border infrastructure program. We widened one of the crossings at Lewiston from four lanes to five lanes. We were on the cusp of another bridge being twinned. In advance of that we improved the plaza infrastructure on both the American side and the Canadian side so that the conduit to the United States would not be strangled. We moved forward on these insightful programs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942715">I found it most interesting too that the NDP criticized us for failing to address some of the programs like child care.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="942716">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to have this opportunity to stand and speak about this year's budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942717">There could have been a lot more big initiatives in this budget, but the government has left the cupboard bare. The federal government has no money and no power to help fund health, education and infrastructure. I fear that the government has done more damage to the federation with its budgets than it ever could have done by reopening the Constitution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942718">My riding has serious challenges that have to be addressed. The government has put $10 billion on the debt, which is $10 billion that would not have been there, were it not for the 10 good years of solid Liberal fiscal management.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942719">It is a good thing to pay down the debt, but it seems to be a waste when we look at the infrastructure deficit in this country. Canada has the lowest debt to GDP ratio in the G-8. Does it make sense to pay down so much of the debt given the challenges that we face on infrastructure? In my riding alone, the government could spend a billion dollars on infrastructure and probably the job still would not be done. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942720">For example, the CBRM, the Cape Breton Regional Municipality is the largest municipality in my riding. The CBRM is in debt to the tune of $90 million. How is the CBRM going to pay for its infrastructure? At the same time, there are new national guidelines which will require secondary sewage treatment in the next decade. Without federal and provincial help, the municipality will never be able to afford the infrastructure. The council and the mayor are not spending money on frivolous projects. The money is being spent on basic sewage, water and roads, but they are only scratching the surface.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942721">The Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment is planning a new national standard for municipal waste water treatment. Once it is implemented, it will require secondary level treatment of all sewage being discharged into rivers, lakes and oceans. This will happen as early as the next decade.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942722">Recently I met with a group of citizens from the New Waterford and Lingan area who were very concerned and upset because of the inadequacy of their sewage treatment plant. Sewage is running into the drains. They want something done. Those people pay their taxes. Also at the meeting was the CBRM's engineer who really wants the project completed, especially with the new guidelines that are coming up. However, there is not enough money coming from the federal government to help with this much needed infrastructure. Everyone has to wait. What will happen when the new guidelines are implemented? The CBRM will be caught in a big bind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942723">The municipality will not be able to plan for the future. Certain projects should be done every year in order to meet the guidelines. The guidelines are important in this day and age; we have a rich country and Canadians should have safe sewage and drinking water standards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942724">The CBRM has to comply with the new standards. It could cost $400 million for the sewage and water projects that must be completed. How will the municipality come up with the money to pay for these projects?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942725">Another municipality in my riding, Victoria County, faces challenges. Victoria County is large and encompasses the Cape Breton Highlands National Park. There is also Pleasant Bay. It is the whole region on the northern part of Cape Breton, which has a small population. It will be very difficult to service some of the needs of this region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942726">The north side of my riding is badly in need of a new rink. Leo Steele and the North Sydney rink committee are doing a great job. They have raised over a million dollars from volunteers and have commitments from the business sector and local community members. The CBRM has also done its best to put a million dollars on the table. As many in this House know, a basic rink cannot be built for under $10 million these days. More money is needed for infrastructure. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="942727">Recreation facilities right across my riding, and right across Nova Scotia and the country are in desperate need. Many of these were built in the 1970s and the condition they are in now, whether they be refrigeration equipment, bathroom facilities or the structures themselves, some need to be repaired and others need to be replaced. There has to be an infusion of money to help these recreation facilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942728">The only bright side I see about infrastructure for municipalities in the budget is the gas tax transfer payment. Again, that was a Liberal initiative. The member for <Affiliation DbId="78571" Type="2">LaSalle—Émard</Affiliation> announced it in Sydney a few years ago. It was greatly received not only by the province but also by the municipalities. I guess I have to say that the Conservatives did one good thing in this budget, which is to continue on with the Liberal initiative to leave the gas tax with the municipalities where it is greatly needed, but one wonders why the government has no new ideas of its own to deal with infrastructure or recreation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942729">Let me talk about roads. The roads in my riding are deplorable. During the break a few weeks ago I visited rural areas. I started in Pleasant Bay and travelled to Cape North, Ingonish, New Haven and Neils Harbour. Everywhere I went, the roads were in deplorable condition. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942730">One might say that roads are a provincial issue, but they are not really, because the national park system is in much of my riding. Many of the residents of small fishing and tourist communities have to travel through the park system and the road are in much need of repair. Again, many of the roads were built in the 1970s and have to be fixed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942731">On my tour when I travelled the rural areas, including Iona and Middle River, the issues that need attention in those areas are roads and water. There is a new water line going in to Iona but it is not going far enough. The railroad is causing a problem. As we can see, the rural areas need a lot of help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942732">Many in the House will recognize the village of Baddeck. This year Baddeck is celebrating its 100th anniversary. One hundred years ago the village was created and there will be some celebrations, but next year is going to be a very important year for the community of Baddeck. It will be the 100th anniversary of the flying of the Silver Dart by Alexander Graham Bell. It was done on a cold February day on the ice of Baddeck Bay 100 years ago. It was the first flight in all the Commonwealth. It is going to be a big event next year that will be held in Baddeck and all over Cape Breton. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942733">It is not going to be just a Cape Breton celebration. It is going to be a Canadian celebration of the great inventor Alexander Graham Bell, who lived at Beinn Bhreagh and did much work not only for the deaf and hearing impaired but for the aviation industry. There is going to be a big do next year. It is going to kick off in February. There will be special events and will close off with the Celtic Colours, which is a big musical festival in my riding. People will come from all over the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942734">My point is there is an ask in to the government to help the communities out with some infrastructure and facilities, but they have not seen anything yet and this could have been in the budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942735">The city of Sydney is the largest community in my riding and it has some great economic opportunities. It used to be one of the busiest ports on the east coast with steel and coal. In World War II it was very busy. Right now it has big potential. There are cruise ships coming in. Coal is going to be hauled from Donkin. However, the port needs to be dredged. That is another thing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942736">Marine Atlantic is on the north side and the ferries go to Newfoundland. It was announced in the budget that it will get $17 million, which sounds like a lot, but it is chartering a new ferry. It is not building a new ferry like we had in our plans. We also need new facilities there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942737">Also, there have been hardly any announcements in the last while from Enterprise Cape Breton, which is an offshoot of ACOA. We are very concerned about Enterprise Cape Breton because it is under review, especially when there has been a cut to the ACOA budget.

              <ParaText id="942739">Mr. Speaker, what I liked most about the hon. member's speech is that when he spoke it came from the heart and it came from some experience he had already. When I listened to him, it could come to light because I come from a rural area much the same as the hon. member and I see what is going on in the municipalities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942740">I was also a former municipal councillor and I see the shortages. The average age of infrastructure across Canada ranges anywhere between 80 and 115 years. Communities and cities are the basic building blocks for the Canadian economy. Without that infrastructure in place, the communities fall apart. If the communities fall apart, then the economy starts to tremble and it starts falling apart. We need that infrastructure in place and it has to be renewed. I know we can argue about whether it is provincial responsibility or it is federal responsibility but when it comes down to it, it affects all of us and all of us have a stake in this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942741">Maybe the hon. member could explain how ignoring the infrastructure will affect not only the economy in his riding but also the economy of all of Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="942743">When we talk about the Cabot Trail, it is one of the icons of Canada. It was also voted in many magazines as one of the best destinations on Cape Breton Island to go to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942744">Now when the infrastructure is collapsing in this region, what happens? People do not travel. Tourists do not come. When they get disappointed about coming, they email back to other friends that this is a hard place to get to and that the roads are bad. It has a reflection on all Canada when a riding that has the Cabot Trail in it has infrastructure that is falling apart. In the summertime there are millions of tourists from all over the world visiting all these rural areas of the country. Most people visit to see our wildlife. What happens when they get on some of the roads and see some of the infrastructure? We need more infusion into our parks because when people go through our parks they need to have a good experience. They cannot see the scenery and watch the wildlife when their vehicles are going all over the place.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="942746">The final sentence is: I said all these things against the Conservative budget because it is a bad budget but I am voting for it. That is the important missing element from Liberal members of Parliament who are speaking against the budget in the House but neglecting to tell Canadians and their constituents that they are voting for it, that they are supporting this budget and propping up the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942747">Most Canadians see that wrong direction as a complete absence of concern for working Canadian families. The budget does not have a cent for housing. Nothing in it actually affects Canadians' quality of life in a positive way. It just has a lot more corporate tax cuts. The government is a one-note government. The Liberals have some very legitimate criticisms but they are voting for it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="942753">Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to have the opportunity to speak to the budget this afternoon and honoured to be splitting my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78695" Type="2">Oshawa</Affiliation> who is the <Affiliation DbId="78953" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry</Affiliation> and who has done an outstanding job on behalf of not only his community but the auto sector and certainly industry across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942754">It is an honour to rise today in my place and speak in favour of budget 2008. This is a budget that delivers support for individuals, families, small businesses and large corporate employers. This is a budget that invests in Canada's physical capital and it is a budget that invests in Canada's human capital.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942755">This budget, in particular, is one that speaks to the needs of my constituents in St. Catharines, a community where thousands of jobs depend on maintaining a strong and vibrant manufacturing sector, a community where thousands and more depend on trade and tourists to continue to flow across a safe and secure border and a community where thousands of students of Brock University need to work hard every day to ensure their tuition bills get paid. For my community, budget 2008 gets the job done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942756">We know that certain economic forces outside of our control mean that there will be challenges ahead but with this budget we have shown that we are ready. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942757">In budget 2008, our government has laid out a strategic plan, with targeted investments in specific sectors, to ensure that our economy remains stable and that the next generation will have the skills it needs to compete in the new global economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942758">I will speak to that strategy. Beginning in 2009, every Canadian over the age of 18 will be eligible to deposit up to $5,000 per year in a tax-free savings account. The money deposited will not be exempt from tax but all capital gains and investment income on those sheltered funds will be. Withdrawals can be made at any time and they will not be taxed. Unused contribution room can be rolled over and the contribution limits will be indexed to inflation. Income earned within and withdrawals made from a TFSA will not result in the clawing back of any means tested federal benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942759">Finance Canada estimates that in combination with existing registered plans, the TFSA will eventually allow over 90% of Canadians to hold all of their assets in tax efficient saving vehicles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942760">All good economists know that incentives matter. This proposal gives Canadians a strong incentive to save, which will help keep our economy strong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942761">It is important for individual Canadians to be financially responsible but it is just as important for the government to do it as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942762">That is why I am proud to be part of a government that as of budget 2008 will have reduced the national debt by $13.8 billion by 2009-10. By 2012-13, total debt reduction by this government since coming into office will be in excess of $50 billion. As I am sure Canadians know, thanks to the tax back guarantee, those reductions mean $2 billion in annual interest savings by 2009-10 which will be dedicated to ongoing personal income tax reductions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942763">As I said earlier, this is a prudent Conservative budget with specific limited investments in targeted areas. One of those priority areas is infrastructure. Cities, like St. Catharines, need help to maintain and upgrade their physical capital. That is why I am glad to see that budget 2008 is making permanent the gas tax fund worth $2 billion in 2009-10. That means on a yearly basis for a riding like mine close to $2 million in yearly investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942764"> I am glad to see that budget 2008 sets aside money for public transit infrastructure. St. Catharines has already benefited from this government's commitment to infrastructure. Just last month I was honoured to announce that we received over $1.7 million to improve water mains in the city of St. Catharines. It was money that was greatly needed and the improvements will be truly appreciated.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="942765">As I mentioned, St. Catharines is also very dependent on our manufacturing sector, which is why budget 2008 is great news for our city. It extends the accelerated capital cost allowance treatment for investment in machinery and equipment for three years, with a 50% straight line accelerated CCA treatment then provided on a declining basis over a two year period following.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942766">Then there is the additional $1 billion in support for Canada's manufacturing industrial sector that will go into the community development trust established just this past winter. Ontario received upwards of $350 million of that funding. In combination, this is a tremendous shot in the arm for an industry hard hit by the international economic climate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942767">One of the largest employers in my community is General Motors so it is great to see that there is support specifically targeted for the auto sector and auto makers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942768">First, the budget allocates $34 million per year for new research to the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council targeted to the needs of key industries like the auto sector. Then there is the outstanding news that we are establishing an automotive innovation fund that will receive $250 million over five years to support strategic, large scale research and development projects by automotive and parts manufacturers in developing greener, more fuel efficient vehicles. It is good news for the environment, it is good news for the economy and, most of all, it is good news for St. Catharines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942769"> There was good news for students at Brock University and Niagara College. As the Millennium Scholarship Foundation winds down, we will provide $350 million for a Canada student grant program in 2009-10, growing to $430 million in 2012-13. Thanks to this reform of federal student support, we will now reach an additional 100,000 students from low and middle income families than we have been able to help under the current system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942770">Parents will be happy to hear that budget 2008 proposes to enhance the flexibility of RESPs by raising the maximum time limits that an RESP may remain open from 25 to 35 years and by extending the maximum contribution period by 10 years. In combination, those measures help make it possible for all Canadians to get the tools they need for our 21st century economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942771">The budget also has a number of measures for families. It provides support for the Mental Health Commission of Canada to help develop best practices to aid Canadians facing mental health and homelessness challenges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942772">It provides support for Canada's food and consumer safety action plan will help prevent lead from showing up in children's toys. There is an expansion of the list of eligible expenses under the medical expense tax credit, including service dogs and training to help individuals cope with disabilities or disorders such as autism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942773">My riding has over 23,000 seniors who are active and involved in the political process. I know they will be happy to hear about the results delivered in budget 2008.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942774">Like I said, good economic policy is all about incentives, which is why we are increasing from $500 to $3,500 the guaranteed income supplement exemption for earned income. In other words, we are ensuring that lower income seniors who want to stay in the workforce are not facing government disincentives if they make that choice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942775">In the same vein, we are extending to 2012 the targeted initiative for older workers to help even more older workers who want to stay in the workforce.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942776">For seniors facing the risk of elder abuse, budget 2008 provides over $13 million over three years to help seniors and others recognize the signs and symptoms of this terrible phenomenon. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942777">To recognize the debt of honour we owe Canadians and our veterans, budget 2008 expands the veterans independence program to support the survivors of veterans. It is the right thing to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942778">Finally, I mentioned that my community needs trade and tourism to keep flowing over a safe and secure border and budget 2008 makes that possible. We will be investing over $15 million in Niagara over two years to establish a permanent facility to enhance the security of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Seaway region. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942779">People right across the country will be glad to see that budget 2008 commits to introducing a higher security electronic passport by 2011 and doubling the validity period to 10 years when this passport is launched.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942780">This a good budget. It shows an awareness of the challenges we face and sets our country on a prudent, responsible course that will see us through to a prosperous future. I eagerly await its passage and look forward to seeing its benefits at home in St. Catharines and right across our great country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="942783">The mayor of the city of Toronto, David Miller, wrote to this particular <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> on February 13, 2008 about the need for a partnership with our cities.

              <ParaText id="942798">We are taking the same approach to federal finances as families would with theirs. In times of economic uncertainty, we do not overextend ourselves. We pay down the debt and focus on government spending. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="942816">I would also like to take some time today to talk about the benefits of this budget to students and hard-working Oshawa families. To date, our government has made nearly 60 tax cuts that will provide almost $200 billion in tax relief over this and the next five years, $140 billion of which will be for individuals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942817">Our government is establishing a proud legacy of tax relief. We have provided relief in every way that government collects taxes: personal taxes, consumption taxes, business taxes and excise taxes. We are now rounding out our tax relief package by reducing taxes on savings with a new tax-free savings account. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942818">Oshawa residents have told me we need a mechanism that will allow them to save more of their hard-earned money and watch it grow, and this government has delivered. This is the first mechanism of its kind in Canadian history and the most important savings vehicle since the introduction of the RRSP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942819">Budget 2008 is also delivering for our students. As a father of three children, I strongly believe in investing in tomorrow's leaders. Budget 2008 invests in our youth and will give them the tools they need to succeed. As the Canada millennium scholarship foundation winds down, our government will provide $350 million for the Canada student grant program, growing to $430 million in 2012-13. This funding will reach over 100,000 more students from low and middle income families than the current system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942820">Budget 2008 is building on initiatives that have already been announced for students. These include education, tuition and textbook credits, public transit credits and an apprenticeship job creation tax credit. We are creating a climate of success for our students and budget 2008 is taking a huge leap forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942821">Through budget 2008 we are also protecting those in need in our communities. To date the Conservative government has committed $1.4 billion over three years through three trusts with provinces and territories to help address short term pressures with respect to affordable housing. I have had the privilege of making housing announcements over the past two weeks, one at the Anderson House and the other at Houselink Delaware, and saw firsthand the results of this funding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942822">We have also committed funding to affordable condominiums in the GTA and to renovate the historic Oshawa hotel. These new units will allow lower income families and individuals in Oshawa to live in safe, quality housing at an affordable cost. We are delivering on a commitment to help those who are homeless and at risk of becoming homeless.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942823">Regrettably, those who are homeless often suffer from mental illness as well. To that end, our government is providing $110 million to the mental health commission to support demonstration projects focused on homeless people who are mentally ill.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="942829"> Unlike the Liberals, we believe Canadians pay too much tax. We understand that high taxes are not good for families, businesses or the long term national interest. That is why, through budget 2008 and previous budgets, we are delivering historic tax relief that will leave more money in Canadians' pockets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942830">We also do not want to saddle future generations, our own children, with debt.

Canadian taxpayers have paid for Liberal inaction with scandals and boondoggles, and I know the people of Oshawa will not go back to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942831">In conclusion, budget 2008 is balanced, focused and prudent, and it delivers for all Canadians, including my constituents of Oshawa. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942832">I want to especially thank the Liberal Party for supporting the Conservative government's third balance budget.

              <ParaText id="942842">It makes sense that an assistance program for the auto industry is concentrated in Ontario, and that there is no assistance for Prince Edward Island or Alberta, in the same way that it made sense during the mad cow crisis that money was given primarily to Alberta, where the crisis was going on.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="942848">Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to say that I will share my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="78337" Type="2">Vaudreuil-Soulanges</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942849">I am very pleased to rise today in this House to talk about my views on this budget, views that are shared by the women we represent, aboriginal women, senior women, single mothers, women who are still in school and veterans' widows. In short, we feel that the budget is certainly not favourable, and this is definitely one of the reasons we will vote against it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942850">Last week, the UN held its 53rd session on the status of women. The minister did not attend, but the coordinator of Status of Women Canada, Clare Beckton, was there. What a surprise it was for the representatives of the social groups at that session to hear Ms. Beckton's statements, in which she simply repeated that Canada would develop an action plan, as set out in the budget, and that Canada's position was very low compared to some European countries, such as the United Kingdom.<Sup /></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942851">This meeting was also attended by Michèle Asselin, of the Fédération des femmes du Québec, Louise Riendeau, of the Quebec association of women's shelters and transition houses, and representatives of many other organizations such as the CSN, FIQ and FTQ. They roundly condemned the fact that, although the budget included an action plan, there was almost no point in mentioning it because an action plan had already been adopted some years ago, in 1995, namely the Beijing platform for action. This is the action plan that we should be implementing to ensure that women are afforded equality and equity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942852">This year, the rhetoric was to have been transformed into action by implementing the Beijing platform for action. I would also like to point out that the report submitted to the Status of Women Canada committee in 2006 by the expert panel of which Ms. Langevin of Laval University was a member, pinpointed the issues and the means of addressing the challenges. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942853">Therefore, we really wonder why the budget mentions a plan, when there are no specific measures geared to women to improve their status, pay equity and so forth. Serious questions are being raised. Are they just trying to look good? In the throne speech, the word woman appeared only once. This year, we have a brief paragraph of six lines that talks about women without providing the means to meet the needs identified by a number of groups.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942854">Prebudget consultations were held and groups told the government exactly what they wanted to see in the budget to improve their condition. It is fairly surprising to note that nothing came of all these consultations. We are left wondering. Is it worthwhile having these consultations? Does the government really want to know what women want to see in budgets or is it all just window-dressing?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942855">Personally, I tend to believe the latter. I have the impression that it is just window-dressing. In fact, the budget before us takes a step backwards. A gender-based analysis should have been carried out before the budget. Unfortunately, there is no sign of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942856"> As Ms. Beckton explained it to us, gender-based analysis (GBA) is supposed to be carried out within the various departments and services before approaching the Treasury Board or the Privy Council. If the gender-based analysis had been done properly, the GBA champions in the various departments would have been able to point out the contradictions in the measures proposed. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="942857"> I am convinced that these people, who do nothing but this kind of work, would have informed the ministers concerned of the different measures proposed and they would have persuaded them to make changes to those measures so that they truly respond to women’s needs and whatever had been found using gender-based analysis. Unfortunately, we see those concerns were not taken into consideration in the measures—and there are not many—that appear in this budget now before us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942858"> Canada has been criticized several times in recent years by the United Nations and by CEDAW, the UN Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Moreover, Canada is still under investigation this year and CEDAW has criticized Canada many times. There is also ICESCR, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which has criticized Canada on several issues, including employment insurance, the absence of day care in Canada and aboriginal women. I say “absence of day care in Canada” because everyone in this House certainly knows that day care services are well provided in Quebec. Quebec has provided day care services and ensured that women in Quebec have proper and effective day care services and that their children are well protected and receive an education that promotes their development until they are able to go to school.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942859"> I think that is a real shame because it was a wonderful opportunity for the government to demonstrate that it really is concerned about the status of women. We saw that with older women who are veterans' widows. I have said often enough that my own mother is a veteran’s widow. She took care of my father for 40 years. Today, she needs help. With this new program that the government has introduced, there is no way for her to receive help, even though she has been a widow for 20 years and she looked after my father for 40 years. It is very clear that my mother is much older than she was in those days. Now, she is the one who needs help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942860"> Yet, the government is not interested in providing help to these widows whose husbands spent six years at the front. We see people now returning from the war in Afghanistan after spending six months at the front and those people are suffering from post-traumatic syndrome and all kinds of conditions. There is help for them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942861">When my father went to war, from 1939 to 1945, he spent six years on the front lines. He took part in all the Mediterranean campaigns, and yet, when he came back, there were no services to help him deal with post-traumatic shock. The only way he could get through the post-traumatic shock was by being with his family, his wife, the woman who helped him his entire life. Today, those very people are being denied assistance, those people who acted in a very exceptional way to support our soldiers returning from the second world war after experiencing so much trauma. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942862">They are not the only people who were abandoned by this budget. Indeed, aboriginal women were once again overlooked. Once again, the government decided to give small amounts of money to small organizations and groups, instead of giving significant amounts of money in order to ensure that aboriginal women living in first nations communities can benefit from adequate services to meet their needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942863">We saw that shelters for aboriginal women receive a subsidy of only $90,000 a year, while women's shelters in Quebec receive a subsidy of $300,000 a year. Yet the needs are quite different. For aboriginal women, the shelters are in the community and are known to everyone. The challenges are therefore even greater. They need even more support and greater security. They must be given adequate services to get out of their difficult situations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942864">I am being signalled that I have only one minute left and I will soon be cut off. Yet I have so much more to say. I will come back to this topic, there is no doubt.</ParaText>

We cannot help but be afraid that, with measures like the ones that have been adopted, things would be even worse if the Conservatives had a majority government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942870">My colleague mentioned the homeless. There are currently 4.2 million homeless people in Canada. We have never seen or known such poverty. Yet the government has a $14 billion surplus which it is whittling down by spending on military equipment and giving tax breaks to oil companies that are making so much money, they do not know what to do with it. The Government of Alberta is forced to send cheques to people because it no longer knows what to do with the money. It is disgraceful.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="942871">Mr. Speaker, I found my colleague's speech very interesting. The Bloc Québécois frequently notices that the government does not listen to the consensus in Quebec, where we want to make our voice heard and help people in difficulty. Even though the Bloc Québécois passes on what Quebeckers are thinking, neither the Liberals nor the Conservatives ever take any action. The government never listens to Quebec. In the medium term, the Bloc Québécois will continue to push and fight to make Quebeckers' voices heard, so that the government will take action.</ParaText>

These things will help Quebec make progress in the direction in which it has been heading for several years now. Unfortunately, the federal government is constantly getting in our way.

              <ParaText id="942877">Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by thanking my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78439" Type="2">Laval</Affiliation> for sharing her time with me and for her analysis of the status of women. I am sure that she could tell us much more, and that it would all be just as interesting as what she has already said. Unfortunately, the government will not have the pleasure of hearing more just now, but I am sure that she will return to the subject in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942878">I am also pleased to see that my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="79021" Type="2">Jeanne-Le Ber</Affiliation>, who has taken over as citizenship and immigration critic, is here in the House today. Although I appreciate the current government's investment in accelerating citizenship and immigration case processing, I find that it has done very little about refugees. Also, the government could have done a lot more about the fees that must be paid by permanent residents coming to Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942879">Without further ado, I would like to talk about the minority Conservative government's third federal budget. I wish I could say that the government has listened to the people, but that is certainly not the case. The day after the budget was presented, Quebeckers, on the whole, reacted negatively.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942880">I want to remind this government that we told them about the threat of an economic slowdown and about the need to change course accordingly. Unfortunately, I have no cure for the government's plugged ears; they remain deaf to the demands of the Quebec people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942881">I will not support this budget, and the reasons are very simple. The Bloc Québécois consulted several communities throughout Quebec. From these consultations, we determined some guidelines, or six priorities that the government should focus on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942882">The government should address the crisis in the manufacturing and forestry industries, for which there was a request for $5.5 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942883">We also wanted the government to restore dignity to seniors who receive the guaranteed income supplement and still live under the poverty line and the low-income cutoff. We were calling for $3.9 billion in retroactivity. When the government was in the opposition, it promised to reimburse seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942884">We wanted $3.5 billion to increase education transfers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942885">The government should invest $1 billion for status of women and social housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942886">Furthermore, $398 million is needed to promote culture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942887">Lastly, we wanted $1 billion to make a 180-degree turn on the environment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942888">In the riding of Vaudreuil—Soulanges, more than 400 people told us their expectations for the budget and the use of the surplus. We carefully analysed all the proposals sent to my constituency office. There were expectations concerning measures for seniors, the environment, taxation, health, families, education, housing, and so on. We analysed all the recommendations and expectations shared by the public. I can also say that people had some rather high expectations concerning the use of the surplus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942889">This was a fantastic example of public participation, and I would like to thank these people for their help. The results have been made public.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="942890">I should add that there was a huge amount of support for seniors who are not receiving fully retroactive guaranteed income supplement payments and are living below the poverty line. The Conservative government will have to answer for its actions and its political choices. Here again, the response greatly exceeded our expectations, and I would like to thank the local stakeholders and community organizations for their contribution. We are getting results when politics serves the people and not the reverse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942891">The Conservative government brought down a very slim budget and did not listen to repeated calls to use a portion of the surplus before March 31, 2008. Quebeckers want a change in direction and major gains for Quebec. Today they are disappointed, and this budget does not come anywhere near reflecting their interests and values. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942892">In the past two years, this Conservative government has spouted its ideology and slashed social programs without any real debate here in the House or in society at large. It is shameful. The government has not even made a commitment to develop foreign policy or defence policy to justify the militarization of Canada. It makes no sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942893">Mr. Speaker, in their budget, the Conservatives decided to put all their extra cash towards the debt. They increased military spending, maintained help to western oil companies and promoted nuclear development while entire sectors of Quebec's economy, hit by crises in the manufacturing and forestry sectors, are suffering because of Ottawa's laissez-faire attitude. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942894"> Workers have also been abandoned and many organizations were counting on this budget for a little help. It is true the Conservatives established a reserve for the employment insurance fund but they are endorsing pillage of the fund by refusing to return the $54 billion already drawn. This money belongs to workers and employers. The government must return it. Unemployed workers would also like to see the EI system improved. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942895">The Conservatives turned a deaf ear to farmers and cattle producers, who were expecting much more aid in view of the urgent issues and the income crisis they face. There is nothing new in the budget for these vital economic sectors in Quebec. If that were not enough, the government went so far as to give $250 million to Ontario's automobile industry when Quebec's problems are just as urgent. In fact, the Conservatives refused to meet the needs expressed by industry and all sectors, including the Government of Quebec. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942896">The Conservatives were in a position to meet Quebec's needs given that there is a surplus of $13 billion for the 2007-08 fiscal period, according to government figures, and room to manoeuvre with the $8.2 billion surplus for 2008-09, according to Bloc Québécois calculations, which have proven to be on the mark, year after year.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="942916">Last week the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> delivered our government's third budget, a budget that builds on our record of strong financial management. It is a budget that reinforces the fiscal advantage for Canada and provides for responsible leadership in the current period of economic uncertainty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942917">In the past three budgets, including budget 2008, the government has provided more than $2.3 billion in new resources for science and technology initiatives. Focusing on targeted priorities, we will maximize the impact of these investments by ensuring they are applied where Canada can use its strengths to make a difference. We are carefully managing spending, reducing debt and ensuring government programs provide value for money while keeping the tax burden to a minimum.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942918">Let me mention a few key measures that we have taken.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942919"> Since 2006, our government's actions will provide $21 billion in incremental tax relief to Canadians and to Canadian businesses this year. We continue our record of strong fiscal management, reducing debt for 2007-08 by $10.2 billion and $13.8 billion by 2009-10. In fact, by 2012-13 total debt reduction, since we came into office, will be more than $50 billion, which is a remarkable achievement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942920">Moreover, we are ensuring that programs and services are affordable, that they are focused and aligned with the priorities of Canadians. In fact, spending this year, as a share of GDP, is below the track set out in budget 2007.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942921">Budget 2008 recognizes the importance of the automotive industry to our long term economic success. Canada's automotive industry is a world leader and provides high quality jobs in many communities across our country. The actions taken by the government will result in over $1.6 billion in benefits for the automotive sector over this and the next five years. The auto sector will benefit, as I pointed out, from over $1 billion in tax relief by 2012-13. In budget 2008 we have also extended the temporary accelerated capital cost allowance treatment for three years on a declining basis. This will provide the manufacturing and processing sectors both with an additional $1 billion in tax relief.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942922">As promised, we have cut the GST from 7% to 6% and now 5%, which has lowered the cost of all new vehicles for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942923">The automotive sector produces 12% of our manufacturing gross domestic product and accounts for 24% of our exports. It directly employs over 150,000 Canadians. At this point in time one out of every six vehicles that is manufactured in North America is made in Canada. Our automotive plants are renowned for their high productivity and for their exceptional quality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942924">Worldwide the automobile industry is, however, changing and automotive technology is evolving very quickly. This presents both a challenge and opportunity for us in Canada. The competition around the world for new assembly plants is, quite frankly, fierce and the future will belong to those countries that both invest the most and aggressively innovate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942925">In budget 2008 the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> announced new key initiatives that broaden and deepen our approach to positioning Canada in this fast paced technologically driven industry. The approach is built on four pillars, which I spoke to in Toronto recently: first, a positive business climate; second, an integrated North American auto sector; third, investing in automotive research and development; and fourth, creating a new automotive innovation fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942926">Dealing with the positive business climate, our strategic economic plan, “Advantage Canada”, creates the first pillar, and that is a positive business climate, which we have achieved by lowering taxes, by cutting red tape, by investing in critical infrastructure and by fostering what is the best educated, most skilled and most flexible labour force in the world.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="942927">This warrants emphasis. I have been to the floor of the assembly plant for trucks in Oshawa. The Canadian workers are the best workers. They are the best automobile assembly people anywhere in the world, with the highest quality product, the lowest number of down days and the lowest number of qualitative problems on the assembly line.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942928">It does not matter of what company we speak. Our plants in Canada earn high marks. In many cases they are best of class facilities and in many cases they are award winning, world calibre facilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942929">The second pillar aims to preserve and support the deep integration of the North American market for vehicles and parts. The Canadian automotive industry has succeeded over the past 40 years because it has integrated with the U.S. industry and has enjoyed easy access to the U.S. market. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942930">There is only one automotive industry in North America. Whether we are speaking of Mexico, or the United States or Canada, this is an industry that is integrated across borders. It must be harmonized if we are to achieve the competitiveness that we need to achieve on a North American basis so we may take on all comers in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942931">In particular, the border at the Windsor-Detroit crossing is becoming increasingly clogged. We cannot remain competitive with a border that clogs and slows down the smooth operation of an integrated industry. Something approaching 40% of Canada's trade is carried across a single bridge constructed before the great depression, the so-call Ambassador Bridge. This is a critical point in terms of our capacity to trade with our American neighbours. I have pointed out repeatedly in other circumstances that in excess of the amount of trade done between the United States and Japan in an entire year moves back and forth across that single bridge in the same period of time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942932">We are working hard to remove barriers to the cross-border flow of vehicles and auto parts. The government will provide $400 million for an access road to the new Windsor-Detroit border crossing, which will also be expanded to provide seamless transportation of goods and services. This is something no previous government has been able to achieve. This government is, and we are moving forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942933">The third pillar of our approach speaks to the importance of investing in R and D. Over the next five years, the government will use new resources in budget 2008 and will redirect existing resources in that budget to create a coordinated automotive R and D plan with industry and key provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942934">Our approach is going to focus on research and development support, which is the dollars the Government of Canada is currently expending, on creating a more innovative Canadian auto industry, making Canada a leader in green automotive technologies, in greenhouse gas reduction and in the long term competitiveness of the automotive sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942935">If Canada is to do this, we need to go one step further. That is where the fourth pillar comes in. The United States and Mexican governments provide extensive support to attract this kind of new automotive investment. Canada's new automotive innovation fund, announced in the budget, allocates $250 million over the next five years to lever large scale private sector R and D and innovation. The fund will target areas in which the Canadian automotive industry has already secured a worldwide reputation, a reputation that we will build on and retool for a new, environmentally conscious, fuel efficient innovation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942936">Our goal is ambitious. It is to ensure that Canada remains the best place in the world to assembly automobiles, but the Government of Canada is just one player. Our success depends on a strong partnership with all members of the automotive team. That includes industry, labour, research institutes, academia, all levels of government and industry itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942937">We have a sound approach for the automotive industry. We are dealing with the circumstances of creating a Canadian value proposition. We have been very good at automotive assembly in the past in our country and we have to be very good in the future. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="942958">First, I would like to talk about the approach our government has taken in this budget, as in the previous one, with respect to the sound management of public funds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942959">In budget 2007, the Government of Canada made a commitment to adopt a new way of managing taxpayer money. We believe that it is very important to ensure that every dollar spent produces concrete and positive results for all Canadians. One of the requirements of this new approach is to examine all the programs and expenditures based on a four-year cycle. Having done that, our government is better able to honour the priorities of Canadians with effective programs focused on the essential role of government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942960">The government has been looking towards the future. It took preventive and decisive measures in fall 2007 and winter 2008 to reduce the debt, by lowering taxes and offering targeted support to the industries in need. We prepare the budget using conservative financial principles. That is why budget 2008 is balanced, targeted and cautious. The budget is an extension of what we have already achieved. We are lowering taxes for individuals and corporations, we are paying down the debt and reducing the size of our national mortgage, we are offering targeted support to the industries in need, we are investing in the future by creating programs that focus on science, education and the environment, and that make it possible to help the least fortunate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942961">When we took power, we had to take care of some important priorities and had to sort out some files that had been neglected for years by the Liberals: the fiscal imbalance, health care, the environment, the state of our armed forces and security, and our families. We are getting the job done while still properly managing our finances.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="942962">Canadians believe that their government must contribute effectively to our society's cultural vitality. This is one of the main goals of my department and other organizations in my portfolio and it is a priority for our government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942963">In fact, since our arrival in government in 2006, we have allocated $50 million in additional funding over two years to the Canada Council for the Arts, with $20 million for 2006-07 and $30 million for the current fiscal year. To mark the 50th anniversary of the Canada Council for the Arts, the government announced that the $30 million in funding will now be provided on a recurrent basis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942964">In addition, communities across Canada are benefiting from an additional investment of $30 million a year as a result of budget 2007. In September I had the pleasure of announcing details of this investment. Among other things, it includes the creation of a new program, building communities through arts and heritage, which supports festivals and activities celebrating local heritage and arts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942965">Support is also being increased for arts festivals under the arts presentation Canada program. The diversity of our cultural and artistic expressions is a treasure to which all Canadians must have access. We believe that national cultural institutions can be located outside the national capital region. We believe that all sectors of our society, including the private sector, must take an active role in the effort to disseminate culture. This is why we have signed an agreement with public and private sector support to establish the Canadian Museum of Human Rights in Winnipeg.</ParaText>

This colonialism is more insidious than at the time of the conquest, but the fact remains that certain populations and nations are still trying to assimilate others through their actions and their values.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="942999">When I see the Conservatives' attitude towards the French language today and their actions that go against the values of Quebeckers, and above all, when I see members from Quebec acting against the best interest of their nation, I wish that colonialism really was a thing of the past.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="943254">Mr. Speaker, I am rising to respond to the point of order raised yesterday by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78423" Type="2">Malpeque</Affiliation> on Bill <Document DbId="3311153" Type="3">C-46</Document>. I gave a brief response yesterday, and wish to add to that at this point in time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943255"> In the point of order that was raised, the member stated that section 47.1 of the Canadian Wheat Board Act stood in the way of the government's introducing Bill C-46.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943256">I thought you should know, Mr. Speaker, and I know it is not for you to decide questions of law, but you should be aware in considering this matter that a review of Bill <Document DbId="3311153" Type="3">C-46</Document> demonstrates that it does not itself change the Canadian Wheat Board's marketing mandate. The bill would only clarify the authority of the Governor General to amend or repeal a regulation made under subsection 47(1). Therefore, the bill is not the kind of situation contemplated by section 47.1. As such, there is no validity in the point raised. Whether or not you wish to delve into that area of questions of law, I leave that for you to determine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943257">However, Mr. Speaker, I would also add that even if you did find that it was a valid issue, we did indicate that there had been clear consultations. I can advise you further that the then minister of agriculture had met at the time with members of the Canadian Wheat Board on a number of occasions, and he did discuss the government's intentions with regard to the production and marketing of barley. Of course there was a broadly taken referendum that was the subject of many questions in this House, so I know that you, Mr. Speaker, will be well aware of that. The result of that consultation was announced in this House. That result demonstrated clearly not only that a consultation occurred, but that the barley farmers did indeed want that freedom of choice in marketing, which is of course the objective of Bill <Document DbId="3311153" Type="3">C-46</Document>.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="943258">Mr. Speaker, I will admit that we are almost in the area of debate here, but a lot of what the member opposite just said relative to this point of order is in fact out of line and not specific on what section 47.1 of the Canadian Wheat Board Act states.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943259">As I said in this House yesterday, the act is very specific. There must be consultations. The Canadian Wheat Board itself said that as of last Saturday there were no consultations. The act is also specific that there must be a plebiscite held, the question to be determined by the minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943260">As the member opposite stated, and he did have it right, there were clear consultations last year, but the former minister of agriculture said that the consultations would not be binding. That is what the former minister of agriculture said: it would not be binding. The act requires that there be a clear plebiscite on the specific legislative point that is being brought forward. The government is clearly in error here, relative to section 47.1, and is in fact doing an illegal act by bringing this legislation forward because the conditions of section 47.1 of the act itself have not been met.</ParaText>

In our 2006 and 2007 budgets, our government put forth a series of measures to provide assistance to the arts and culture community. For instance, there was the $50 million for the Canada Council for the Arts. In fact, it was $20 million for fiscal year 2006 and 2007 and $30 million for this year. The $30 million has been made a recurring amount to recognize the 50th anniversary of the Canada Council for the Arts.<Sup /></ParaText>

In particular, I was very pleased recently to announce substantial financial support for some major festivals which have earned great honour for us in the international community: the Luminato festival, the Montreal International Jazz Festival, the Just for Laughs Festival, the Quebec City Summer Festival and the Quebec Winter Carnival. When the sponsorship program was cancelled under the former Liberal government, the carnival was left with no means of assuring its financial survival. I was pleased to announce $160,000 for the Quebec Winter Carnival. Those are only some of the measures that were taken to support the cultural sector.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="943309">When it comes to public transit, the Conservative government has more excuses than credibility. The government has utterly failed to work with Ontario on its MoveOntario 2020 program. It failed to make the partnerships that are integral to the success of Ontario and other provinces in Canada. Of the little funding it has committed to transit in the last two years, it has taken its sweet time in delivering it. The money for the Spadina subway extension is still sitting in a bank account accruing costs and creating unnecessary and irresponsible delays. This extension is needed.

              <ParaText id="943313">My colleague from Ajax--Pickering has pointed out the government's hypocrisy on transit. During the city of Ottawa's municipal elections in 2006, the then president of the Treasury Board took the unprecedented step of withholding $200 million in federal funding for a light rail project in Ottawa even though the approvals of seven departments of the federal government, including his own, had already been secured. That is unfathomable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943314">The Liberal caucus has proposed a bold and innovative plan to address public transit, our roads, bridges and water treatment plants which are important across the country. We have a balanced approach that would use the surplus to pay off our national debt, as we had before, and our infrastructure deficit. That is the difference between the Conservative government and our previous government and our future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943315">In this year's budget, we would have spent $3 billion on debt repayment to bring our debt to GDP ratio down to 25% by 2012 and invested the remaining $7.2 billion in infrastructure and transit, like the province of Ontario's MoveOntario 2020 program and the recently announced B.C. transit plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943316">While debt repayment remains a key Liberal priority, we cannot and must not allow our communities to suffer, leaving a legacy of crumbling bridges, congested roads and a record-breaking number of smog days. There is too much at stake for Canadians.</ParaText>

That certainly does not sound to me or to Canadians like a government that values protecting the health and safety of Canadians at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943319">There is at least some money being put aside toward Canada's safety system for food, consumer products and health products. I hear my constituents' concerns about pesticides in their food and the safety of toy imports and baby products. Canadians need to know that the products they use meet the highest of standards. I am concerned that the $113 million set aside over two years will not be enough for such important safety concerns.These concerns deserve and warrant the appropriate allocation of funding and attention. I will definitely be following the progress of this initiative very closely. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943320">Thousands of products coming across our borders every day could potentially harm Canadians.

              <ParaText id="943322">Canadians and Thornhill residents will not forget that the government campaigned on health care as being one of its top priorities and yet, in this budget, protecting the health and safety of Canadians only accounts for 3.5% of 2008 initiative spending. However, the government's <Affiliation DbId="78772" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> is the same Ontario minister who gutted our health care system, closed hospitals and fired nurses. Unfortunately, it may not be surprising that the government has spent so little of budget 2008 initiatives on protecting the health and safety of Canadians.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="943342">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the budget today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943343">Last month marked an important milestone for me, but it was not the budget. Forty years ago, on February 24, 1968, I arrived in Canada at the age of 13. In one month, I would say “no English” and in two months I would say, “no speak any English”. Today, I am an elected representative of the largest riding in Canada. There are few countries in the world where a newcomer, who arrived without a command of either official language, could find himself commenting on the national affairs as an equal alongside parliamentarians whose roots go back much further. That is one reason why Canada is a blessed country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943344">I intend to use this opportunity to speak to the budget, a budget that will undoubtedly impact the lives of millions of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943345">It should have been a budget that would prepare the Canadian economy for the hard times forecast for the near future without losing sight of the responsibility we have as parliamentarians to help ordinary Canadians get through those hard times. We cannot ignore the demands the economic downturn is placing on the federal budget, nor can we ignore Canadians in need of help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943346">I would like to focus my remarks on a few issues that I feel are important as they relate to the budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943347">Events ranging from the high Canadian dollar to the U.S. economic downturn to high energy prices are adversely affecting the Canadian economy. Canada, as a trading nation, has long depended on stable international markets and this economic situation should concern us all. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943348">Many dynamic manufacturing, life sciences and high tech enterprises have operations in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="78451" Type="2">Oak Ridges—Markham</Affiliation>. These enterprises employ hundreds and, in some cases, thousands of people in the area. Plus, the local economy in my riding is tied to the largest economy of the greater Toronto area in southern Ontario. Many constituents, like Canadians across the country, are not sheltered from the effects of an ailing economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943349">The impact of the economic downturn on manufacturing in Canada has been especially troubling. More than 130,000 Canadian manufacturing well-paid, high-tech jobs have been lost in the last year alone. If current economic trends continue, more jobs may be lost. For this reason, it was important for the budget to invest in Canadian families. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943350">However, It fell short in several areas. I would like to focus on immigration, trade, health care and infrastructure spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943351">I will start with immigration. Of the more than 200,000 newcomers who choose Canada every year, many settle in the major urban centres in Canada that are home to key industries. Many settle in my riding. Just last month I played host to a group of about 50 new Canadian citizens eager to contribute to our society. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943352">The budget announced several measures to modernize the immigration system and streamline the process so that we can swiftly address our labour needs. As important as it is to improve processing, we also need to assist people once they are in Canada. It is important that we tailor programs to meet their needs and help them to integrate successfully into Canadian society. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943353">The budget does not address foreign credentials. According to the Gandalf Group survey of the top 1,000 companies' executives in Canada, recognizing foreign credentials is one of the measures executives are looking for the government to implement. The government's decision to create a foreign credential referral service a few months ago fell short of addressing one of the major challenges facing new Canadians.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="35">(1535)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="943354">During the last election, the Conservatives promised to set up an agency for foreign credential assessment and recognition. Instead, they announced that Service Canada offices would do little more than refer people to provincial credential offices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943355">Turning to trade, we have learned from the firsthand experiences of many witnesses, who have testified at the trade committee, that Canada needs to diversify its trade relationships. It is never a good idea for business to put all its eggs in one basket. The same holds true for a country like Canada with so many vital export industries. That is why we are exploring the pros and cons of a trade agreement with South Korea in committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943356">The business community has been requesting that we strengthen our representation in India and China. The Liberal Party has promised to harness business, community and research links through the creation of a south Asian foundation of Canada. Much like the Asia-Pacific foundation of Canada, its south Asian foundation counterpart would help Canada tap into the growing dynamism of the Indian subcontinent. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943357">Such measures, designed to foster trade diversification, would help strengthen Canada's competitiveness over time. The government has chosen to concentrate on the Americas, but vision is needed for Canada to remain competitive in the “Asian century”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943358">Moving on to health, Canadians expect parties to work together to improve health care. This is especially true in minority government situations. It is especially true if we are to steer Canada's public health care system through tough economic times. As the vice-chair of the health committee, I am reminded weekly of health care challenges, from wait times to doctor shortages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943359">According to the Canadian Medical Association, almost five million Canadians do not have a physician. I have raised this issue with the <Affiliation DbId="78772" Type="4">health minister</Affiliation> in committee. We have to find ways to continue to address these shortcomings, but the budget fails to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943360">The party opposite campaigned on wait times but dropped the ball in this budget. The budget sets aside funds for health and safety initiatives, but wait times are not among them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943361">Finally, on infrastructure spending, my party would have budgeted $3 billion a year as a contingency reserve to protect us from deficits or times of need, such as natural disasters. This budget left us with projected surpluses of $2.3 billion for 2008-09 and $1.3 billion for the next year, well below the $3 billion contingency fund that Liberals consider the bare minimum to address economic shocks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943362">As the representative of some of Canada's fastest growing municipalities, such as Markham, Stouffville, Richmond Hill and King, I know firsthand how important issues relating to roads, public transit and energy supply are to ordinary Canadians. When I speak to constituents in my riding, traffic congestion often comes up in conversation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943363">We can remain fiscally responsible by allocating a portion of government surplus to debt reduction while also allocating money to fix Canada's infrastructure. However, this budget leaves Canada with few additional contingency funds, owing to previous spending patterns and tax cuts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943364">It is ironic that the government chose to attack our prudent finance plan, claiming we would drive Canada into deficit. This is to distract from its own financial mismanagement, its own program spending and tax cuts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943365">These are some of the shortcomings in the budget, as I see them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="943367">I am glad he is here in the House representing his constituents. He has highlighted for all of us the number of blessings that we have in this great country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943368">I was a little disappointed, though, to hear him use the word mismanagement when it comes to the fiscal record of this government. I would hope that he would not see the fact that we paid down $37 billion of national debt as mismanagement. He alludes to the plan of his party to pay down $3 billion per year. I am not a chartered accountant, but I do know that $37 billion over three budgets is somewhat in excess of $3 billion per year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943369">I would like to ask the member this question. Does he not feel that it is good financial management for this government to pay down debt? This is similar to a person who has a debt, perhaps a mortgage on his house, and who would try to reduce that debt. We are reducing the cost of the interest for future generations. For years and years that debt cost will be reduced by the fact that we have reduced our national debt by $37 billion.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="943381">Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my colleague from Simcoe North.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943382">In the few minutes allotted to me I would like to address some of the broad stroke issues of the budget and then I will talk a little bit about what we are doing in an increased way related to my portfolio of safety and security. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943383">I would also like to talk a little bit about what is going on in my constituency in terms of how the constituency is benefiting from the building Canada fund which gives significant dollars to infrastructure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943384">There has been some debate and I heard some concern brought forward by members of the opposition about the responsible way in which this government is paying down debt. It is something we need to reflect on for a moment because if we do not deal with debt, the interest payments increase, in fact they start to compound and as interest payments increase and a government is compelled to make those payments, in fact the government loses the fiscal capacity to be able to spend its scarce taxpayer dollars on other things of importance like essential services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943385">That is why, when we look at the record of debt in Canada over the last 50 years, we can see under the reign of Pierre Trudeau how the really grotesque uptake of debt started to skyrocket to levels unheard of certainly in Canadian history and really unheard of in much of the democratic world post-second world war.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943386">We cannot blame it all on Mr. Trudeau because subsequent governments followed this fanciful dream that the way to get out of debt was to keep on borrowing. Now, none of us tell our kids that and hopefully we try not to practise that in our own finances. It is rather deplorable when a government would think that the way to get out of debt would be to just keep on borrowing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943387">That trend continued until the early nineties when it took the International Monetary Fund to blow the whistle on Canada. That was a very embarrassing moment for us as Canadians as we realized that the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank were reflecting on Canada's ratio of debt to gross domestic product, and it was saying Canada was in a very fragile financial moment. The fiscal record of the nation was at stake.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943388">That is what happens when debt is ignored. That philosophical approach to economic issues was advocated by, among other people, the economist John Maynard Keynes. He was a strong proponent of this spend and tax cycle and trying to put on the brakes, put on the gas, as they used to call it, and try to govern the economy that way. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943389">He was asked by an astute observer at one point, “As debt increases, do you not hit a point where in the long run, an economy is no longer able to sustain itself?” Keynes replied that in the long run, we will all be dead. That was the economic depth of his answer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943390"> I may be, in the shorter run, but my kids and grandkids will not be. I do not like the fact that he and others in government can shrug that off. I do not like the fact that my kids and grandkids would be paying and having to finance his dreams which probably did not come to fruition because the economic world of many countries largely abandoned that ridiculous approach that we can get out of debt by continuing to go into debt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943391">That is why we have a <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and a government that believes we have to aggressively pay down debt. As we do that, we reduce those interest payments every year. We free up money to spend on essential services. We made a commitment that we are not going to take the interest savings and just spend those.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943392">As a matter of fact, we are going to return those in the form of tax savings. That is the second part of the budget I want to talk about. Since we have formed the government, we have reduced taxes in over 60 different areas including the GST. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943393">This combination of a commitment to reduce debt and reduce taxes sends a robust signal to the marketplace, both within Canada and abroad where people are wondering if they should be investing in their businesses here, or should they be looking to jurisdictions that are less taxed and less indebted. Those twin signals of reducing debt and reducing taxes build confidence in people who are investing whether it is a small business, medium sized business, or large business.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="50">(1550)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="943394">Also, as international fund managers look around the world at signals from economies where there can be some sense of longevity in terms of prosperity and opportunity, those kinds of signals will attract investment dollars, which attracts jobs, and we wind up with the combined effect of lowering people's taxes. We then have more people paying taxes because more people are working, but they are all paying at a lower rate. That is the way to keep an economy rejuvenated. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943395">This is a very solid process that the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> is advocating and has put before us today. I hope members of the opposition would begin to clear away some of the fog they have on this issue of paying down debt and reducing taxes and see that those two factors have a rejuvenating effect, not just on the economy but on individuals who sense that hard work, incentive and investment can pay off for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943396">In the area of safety and security, under areas of my portfolio, we have made significant increases in some key areas. When we look at investment in one area, we need to send signals that we have a secure nation, and we do, and we have a nation that will work other nations to deal with criminal elements, risks of terrorism and natural disasters. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943397">This is why we have made investments in some key areas at the border. We want to ensure traffic flowing across our borders, low risk travel and cargo, can move more rapidly. We also want to ensure that our border officers and others are equipped not just with the latest technology, but with the latest training to intercept goods, which could be contraband, dangerous or illegal, and also individuals who could be a threat to our country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943398">This is why the budget makes significant increases in those areas at our borders, with our integrated border teams that work with officers on the other side of the border and a $430 million investment in technology to provide the technological means.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943399">We have made investments related to all trucking companies. We will ask for this within five years, but it is a process that has begun. All trucking companies will forward, by electronic manifest, the contents of their cargoes. They will forward that information to the borders even before they arrive. Therefore, the threat and risk assessments are done before the trucks arrive and the low risk ones can move through more quickly. Others identified as being possibly at risk can be sent to a secondary station and have a more thorough inspection.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943400">We have increased the former budget by $161 million with a commitment to see 1,000 more RCMP officers on the street. We announced in this budget $400 million to provinces, on a per capita basis, so they can hire more municipal officers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943401">At the local level, we heard the announcement by the president of the Federation of Municipalities that the budget was good for cities and communities across the country because of the infrastructure fund. This is the largest ever infrastructure fund set aside for that purpose in Canadian history. A significant portion of that will go to the province of British Columbia, which I am honoured to represent, as well as the constituency of <Affiliation DbId="78682" Type="2">Okanagan—Coquihalla</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943402">People like Mayor Graham Reid in Peachland, Mayor Gregory in Summerland, the newly elected mayor of the new municipality on the west side, Mayor Neis, and the mayor of Oliver have all experienced the results already of those infrastructure dollars. I have been able to work with other planners and elected people to see infrastructure increase because of dollars that flow to vital areas like water treatment, road construction, the very basic things people look for to make their constituencies strong and give them some predictability for the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943403">Again, I remind members to think about the broad brush elements. We are reducing debt and taxes. I have not addressed many areas covered in the budget, but we are able to address those areas. We are able to put $1 billion into a community development trust for communities when their traditional areas of industry are hit. We can do all those things and meet the needs of students and others because we have taken a prudent approach to the fiscal management of our nation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="943411">Mr. Speaker, my hon. friend's question while well-intended is sadly misinformed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943412">First, what was most notable was how he prefaced his question on the area related to debt by saying what the Liberal approach would be. He said “if we did nothing”. That is the suggested Liberal approach to debt reduction. He said that if we did nothing, we would see the ratio of debt to GDP, GDP is the overall income, all the revenues that come into a nation, go down by the year 2014 and everything would be fine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943413">If we leave the debt unattended, but the economy continues to grow, which it will under our sound fiscal policies, we will see the revenues come in and it will look, on a ratio, that the debt has been reduced. However, by leaving it alone, the payments are staying there. As a matter of fact, the debt payments would increase. For years, the policy of the Liberals has been to leave the debt alone as much as possible. That policy will not reduce the debt payments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943414">In alarm, he said that we had reduced the revenue bases, which is code for we do not like reducing people's taxes. The Liberal philosophy is, “Give us all of your money. We know how to spend it much better than you do”. I am delighted we have reduced some revenue bases, like income taxes, taxes to seniors, taxes to low income people and the GST. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943415">This past weekend my wife and I were able to help my son and my daughter-in-law move. They just purchased a new house. They bought that home for close to $400,000. We reduced the GST from 7% to 5%. This means that young couple, like thousands of couples across the country buying new houses, saved $8,000. That is $8,000 in their pockets. If the Liberal government were in place, the Liberals would have that money. I am much happier that my son and daughter-in-law have it rather than the Liberals.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="943416">Mr. Speaker, it is a great privilege to speak in the budget 2008 debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943417"> Our budget builds on the strong performance of our country and its government in recent years. It also prepares us for the realities of slower economic growth. The measures that we took in the fall economic statement ahead of the curve are helping to cushion the country's economy in a responsible and balanced way that will keep our economic fundamentals strong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943418">Canada has come a long way from the volatile economic times we experienced in the seventies and eighties, with high inflation and interest rates, high taxes and burgeoning public debt at both levels of government. However, lessons were learned and eventually, with a lot of pain and hard work by governments, businesses and, indeed, Canadian families and workers, we emerged to see a country on the strongest footing we have enjoyed since the 1960s. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943419">We are a stronger trading nation, a more educated nation, a nation that is investing in research and the knowledge economy, a nation that is investing in public infrastructure and a nation that puts its provincial partners on a fairer, predictable funding base. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943420">Taxes are lower than they have been since the 1960s. Inflation and interest rates are low and stable. Public debt is tracking to its lowest rate against GDP in my lifetime. The Canadian dollar is strong. We know that poses some challenges, but the stronger dollar reflects our stronger position in the world, and that is something in which we should take some pride.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="943421">As a result of our careful financial stewardship, the economy is in good shape; Canadians are working hard, paying their taxes and raising their families; 400,000 new jobs have been created in the past two years and unemployment is at its lowest level in 33 years.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="943422">We are well positioned to cushion the slowing down of the global economy, a position that augers well for the future. In fact, the only sure thing we know looking forward is that once the U.S. gets back on a stronger growth curve, and it will, from time to time events will occur in the world that may impact Canada's economy negatively. We have seen them before: the weakening of Asian capital markets, 9/11, the tech bubble, SARS, BSE, and now the U.S. slowdown after what was a long and sustained growth period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943423">The very best way for Canada to withstand these pressures, which are for the most part outside our control, is to keep our economic fundamentals strong and competitive. That approach will attract investment and keep jobs in Canada, keeping the opportunity for Canadian families to improve their incomes and indeed improve their standard of living against any measure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943424">For these reasons, I have been very surprised and quite frankly concerned at the nature of political discussions in this place during the weeks leading up to the budget and even recently. We had opposition members calling for major government interventions as if to somehow backstop the U.S. slowdown, believing that Canada somehow could spend its way to preventing a recession south of the border.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943425"> It is actually quite bizarre. Those members seem to favour going back to the days of higher taxes, bigger government handouts and the kinds of interventions that played havoc with our economy before and would surely help get us in trouble again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943426">We cannot go back. We will not go back. Budget 2008 builds on the already proper and successful approaches we have taken in budgets 2006 and 2007 and last fall's economic statement. It also falls directly out of the most masterful and visionary economic plan this country has seen, certainly in all my years, and that is the “Advantage Canada” plan introduced in November 2006. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="943428"> It will give Canada and Canadians a competitive advantage: a tax advantage with the lowest rate on business investment in the G-7; a fiscal advantage by reducing our debt and leaving the next generation on a stronger foundation; an entrepreneurial advantage by making Canada a good place to do business, one with less red tape and paper burden; a knowledge advantage, improving skills and awarding excellence in education and research; and finally, an infrastructure advantage, with the most robust investment in public infrastructure we have seen since the second world war.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943429">As parliamentarians we are given the responsibility to shape public policy and public expenditures so that all Canadians have access to a better quality of life. “Advantage Canada” and its five pillars and our last three balanced budgets aim directly at achieving advantage for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943430">For the benefit of those tuned in from my riding of <Affiliation DbId="78579" Type="2">Simcoe North</Affiliation> and for all viewers this afternoon, I would like to take just a moment to highlight some of the key improvements in our budget 2008 that speak directly to Canadian advantage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943431">To help all Canadian families and seniors protect their savings and maximize their incomes, we have introduced the first major innovation in Canadian savings policy since the RRSP in 1957, and 1957 was a very good year. This is the new tax-free savings account. From age 18 on, Canadians can now put up to $5,000 per year into a savings account and the earnings will grow in that account tax free. If the whole $5,000 cannot be used in one year, the unused portion can carry forward for future use.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943432">For the heart of the manufacturing economy in <Affiliation DbId="78579" Type="2">Simcoe North</Affiliation>, especially in Penetanguishene, Orillia and Midland, we have extended the accelerated depreciation allowance for another three years on a declining scale so that new capital equipment can be written off more quickly to save taxes and to invest more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943433">We know that the future health of our manufacturers requires new investment in the kinds of machines and tools we will need to compete with the very best in the world. Our government is helping to do that. It does not hurt that those purchases can now be made with a more valuable Canadian dollar.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="943434">This is on top of a new $250 million automotive innovation fund that will help our automotive sector invest in the kind of green, fuel efficient products that are certain to the lead the market in this new economy and develop the kind of tooling and systems needed to keep Ontario the very best place in the world, as we know, to assemble automobiles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943435">To expand our knowledge advantage, we are helping 245,000 college and undergraduate students a year with a bigger and better Canada student loan program, with $350 million by 2009-10, rising to $430 million in 2012-13.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943436">For the many seniors in Simcoe North and across Canada, in addition to the tax savings we have brought in from bigger tax credits, smaller tax rates and pension splitting, budget 2008 gives those seniors who have some extra earnings the ability to declare up to $3,500 per year of earned income before which their GIS would be affected. It used to be that anything over $500 was clawed back from the GIS, but not any more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943437">On the infrastructure front, the gas tax transfers that flow to our municipalities and will reach a record level in the next fiscal year will now be permanent, dependable and predictable transfers directly from the Government of Canada to help with municipal infrastructure improvements. We had extended that gas tax funding in budget 2006 to 2014, but now it will not stop. This measure will add an additional $4.5 million per year for the eight municipalities in Simcoe North.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943438">For law enforcement and police services, and indeed to keep our communities safer, budget 2008 commits $400 million for the hiring of 2,500 new police officers. The share for Ontario policing will be $156 million to help with Ontario police forces and services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943439">Finally, in five cities across Canada, there is some groundbreaking work under way by the Mental Health Commission in a program that will see some $110 million spent to develop best practices and a new model for dealing with Canadians facing homelessness that is occasioned by mental illness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943440">Those are some of the highlights of budget 2008 in which I know the people of Simcoe North will take an interest. It is a tremendous honour to serve the people of my riding. I am proud to serve them as part of a government that is taking strong, decisive action to bolster our economy even in the face of uncertain economic times.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="943442">Mr. Speaker, there is a question I would like to pose to my colleague across. The common acceptance is that the budget was a mile wide and an inch thick. One investment that was made but fell far short of a promise the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> made was the $282 million to the veterans independence program, which is about half of what was needed to cover the promise the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> made to supply the veterans independence program to all widows of veterans from the second world war and the Korean war, to the widows of all veterans.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="943445">There is nothing more important than supporting the families of our veterans. As I see, the Speaker might have some affiliations there as well. It is very important for the Legion, which is out there helping to support families of veterans, particularly the families of those who are no longer with us. This is an important commitment to the families of veterans. It is $282 million, which will help with the kinds of services they need so they can remain independent in their homes. I think it is a great step forward in supporting them and honouring the work they have done for the country.</ParaText>

As a result of the budget, I now have people contacting me on a regular basis telling me how excited they are. They are people over the age of 65 who are now able to go and help out in so many cases, particularly in the service industries that have been looking for help. These people have been willing to work but they would not because of the clawbacks in the past.

The nice thing is that because of the measures introduced in budget 2008 they now can have that little bit of extra income that will help with their expenses and they will not have to be concerned about it being clawed back out of GIS.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943450">This is a tremendous support. As well, it supports other programs that work to help seniors to be active in their communities and to continue to be engaged. Now they can do so without having to suffer a financial penalty for it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="943456">This budget is about making choices. This is the third budget from the Conservative government that steers Canada in the wrong direction. This budget is a continuation of an agenda that is failing hard-working Canadians, seniors and children, students, first nations and the environment. But there is one segment of society that is looking at this budget and thanking the government and it is the big banks and big polluters. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943457">If we look closely at this budget we see a lot of re-announcements. When we watched the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> deliver this budget speech it was like watching reruns of a very bad serial. In an effort to fool Canadians into thinking that the Conservatives are putting more money into programs and services, the government has listed money from previous budgets, but what the government did not list was all the money it gave to big banks and big polluters in its fall economic statement. I guess the Conservatives do not want Canadians to remember that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943458">Let me remind Canadians what those huge giveaways were and maybe talk a little about how the Conservative government is spending Canadians' tax dollars on their friends. Over $12 billion will be given away annually by 2011 in corporate tax cuts as announced last fall, amounting to approximately $60 billion by 2013, only five short years from now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943459">For every $1 in new spending, $6 will go to corporate tax giveaways. No wonder the government did not list those figures. It does not want Canadians to know how much of their money is going into corporate pockets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943460">Another thing the government did not mention is that ordinary taxpayers are now paying the bulk of the taxes, almost three times more than corporate tax, and yet individuals are not getting their fair share of the returns. Most people understand that taxes are the price we pay to take care of one another. We want our taxes to pay for schools, hospitals, infrastructure, child care and a host of other services that help us through our daily lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943461">The Conservatives, supported by the Liberals, have spent our tax dollars. They have blown the federal surplus. Now they tell us that we have to be prudent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943462">The headlines today are predicting a grim economic outlook. We had a surplus that could have been used to support programs that would help ordinary Canadians weather this storm. We in the NDP have been calling on the government to invest in our communities, in the services that ordinary hard-working Canadians need and depend on to help make ends meet, especially for those tough economic times to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943463">The Conservative government chose not to invest in those things. The Conservatives made a choice in this budget and their choice was clear. They chose to favour big banks and polluters instead of hard-working Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943464">In my riding of <Affiliation DbId="78991" Type="2">Vancouver Island North</Affiliation> I have been calling for some assistance for the forestry industry. Earlier this year the government announced a billion dollars for struggling resource communities to help with economic development and retraining, but with the magnitude of the crisis in the forestry sector alone, a billion dollars Canada-wide and for all sectors will not go very far.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943465">The Elk Falls sawmill in Campbell River is on the brink of closing. It is just one of the 112 mills closed in this country that has put over 30,000 people out of their jobs in resource dependent communities. The workers of that mill want to know how much of that billion dollars will come to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943466">The forestry industry is at a crossroads and is looking to the government for assistance. The money in this budget for advertising a sustainable and innovative sector will not be worth much if there is no innovative and sustainable sector to advertise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943467">Canada is in a good position to be a world leader in forest products, and our forest resources can be an environmental and economic asset for generations to come. The government has a role to play and it must recognize it before we lose any more opportunities to another country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943468">There were also several glaring omissions from this budget. I looked for new money for fish habitat restoration, management and enforcement and fish stock enhancement, but there was no new money. This is another industry in B.C. that is in crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943469">There was no mention of anything to assist commercial and recreational fishermen. Wild salmon stocks are perilously low. If any species is classified under the Species at Risk Act, it can have a devastating impact on the economy of British Columbia. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="20">(1620)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="943470">We know that fish habitat is being negatively impacted by industrial development and global warming, but we do not know all the factors that are impacting our wild salmon when they go to sea, and it is even more important to increase research spending so that we can find out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943471">Local volunteer groups like the Puntledge River and Tsolum River restoration societies are working hard to rebuild salmon populations in those two rivers, but they are getting fed up with the lack of support from the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943472">First nations in Vancouver Island North depend on wild salmon for their food, and for social and ceremonial purposes. The federal government has a legal obligation to first nations when it comes to fish. For them, for commercial fishermen, for sport fishermen, for environmental groups, for tourism in Vancouver Island North, sadly, the government did not choose to invest increased funding for measures that would help rebuild the west coast fishery. Are we to see our fishery go the way of the east coast fishery? I hope not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943473">The Conservative government chose once again not to help Canadians across this country with an affordable housing program. Sadly, there are too many people living in substandard and unsafe housing. Some of it cannot even be called housing. In Courtenay there are over 200 people who do not have a home. They live at the local campsite or in their cars, if they have one, or maybe they are couch surfing, and yes, some of them live on the streets. I have been visiting our local service providers in Courtenay and Campbell River lately and when I ask what the number one issue for local people accessing their services is, they tell me it is poverty and homelessness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943474">The NDP called on the government to invest in affordable and social housing and a strategy to reduce homelessness. Instead, the government has chosen to do five pilot projects related to homelessness and mental illness. While that in and of itself is a start, it does not go nearly far enough to address the staggering crisis of homelessness in this country for people with mental illness or not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943475">The Conservatives' record on the environment is also dismal. Their biggest new spending was for nuclear development. I guess they have to invest in nuclear if that is their idea of clean energy and a way to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Instead of implementing a cap and trade system that would make the big polluters pay and then use that money to invest in alternative energy sources like wind and solar power, the government chose to study it. At a time when the environment is the single most important issue for everyone in Canada, the government is doing nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943476">Ordinary Canadians want their country to lead the way. They are way ahead of the government in the little things like recycling and using more environmentally friendly products, changing their habits and their lives, but for the bigger ticket items like heat pumps, solar panels or hybrid vehicles, the government needs to step up to the plate. The eco-energy program is woefully inadequate and does little to help working families change their windows or heating systems. Instead of building on the eco-auto program, the government scrapped it. Our grandchildren deserve better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943477">As I said earlier, a budget is about making choices. It is obvious where the Conservative heart is and it is obvious who those members favour. In all the choices that they have made in this budget, in their previous economic statement, and in budgets 2006 and 2007, they have chosen to help the people who need it the least. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943478">At a time of enormous federal surplus, when we could have afforded to take care of the most vulnerable, the most disadvantaged, and ordinary hard-working Canadians who need a little help, seniors, students, children, struggling industries and the environment, the Conservative government has chosen to look the other way.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="943480">Mr. Speaker, the hon. member was talking about the effects of the budget with respect to initiatives relating to the environment. I would like to mention to the hon. member that the budget provides for $240 million for carbon capture and sequestration. That would take carbon dioxide out of the air and store it underground. In fact, it happens in my constituency where this project will be taking place. One thousand tonnes of carbon dioxide will be captured from the air per day, or a million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year, and sequestered. It is establishing the technology to do that on a continuous basis for coal fired plants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943481">Does the member not think that is not only innovative but it goes a long, long way toward solving an environmental problem, that is the amount of CO<Sub>2</Sub> in the air? It is a novel prospect of taking that and putting it underground and doing something useful with it by enhancing oil recovery, something that is already happening in my community of Weyburn, Saskatchewan which imports the CO<Sub>2</Sub> from the United States.

              <ParaText id="943484">Now we see that the Conservatives put $250 million into the ground in the member's riding in a pilot project. Sadly, that money is not going to help pay for alternative energy development. It is not going to help ordinary families deal with the skyrocketing prices of fuel to heat their homes. It will not do anything to help the woefully inadequate eco-energy program that ordinary Canadians are having a hard time accessing as they try to do the right thing and make sure that their homes are environmentally sustainable.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="943487">Mr. Speaker, I was wondering what the hon. member thought about the centrepiece of the budget, namely the tax-free savings account. A properly advised client would first of all invest in an RRSP, and that is a considerable sum of money with a tax deduction attached, and then after that presumably would invest in an RESP which gives a government incentive to invest and is protected during the time the money is in there, and then if the person had any money left over after that, the money would go into a tax-free savings account.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="943489">Mr. Speaker, the tax-free savings account is sadly inadequate and does nothing to help ordinary Canadians be able to save money. Individuals' savings in this country according to Statistics Canada have gone down, not because people did not want to save money, but because they could not afford to. Ordinary families cannot afford things like the cost of prescription drugs, the cost of housing, the cost of fuel to heat their homes, the cost of child care, the cost of health care and the user fees that are going to be imposed on them when everything is done under public private partnerships.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943490">This centrepiece for the Conservatives' budget is sad. Unfortunately, it will do nothing to help individuals save money in my riding of Vancouver Island North.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="943493">I rise today on the discussion about the budget, which we will vote on tonight. The NDP will be voting against this budget and we have many reasons for voting against it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943494">The Conservative government said that it would be very careful in this budget because a recession would probably be coming, industry was not doing that well and that we are going in the direction of what is happening in the United States. When we look at those statements we see that what the government forgot to say is that it looked after its friends last year by giving $14 billion to big business and a break in taxes and that now it was nice just to be safe.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="943495"> We should take a look at this budget. The Conservative government said very clearly that it needed to present a very cautious, prudent budget. At the same time, it had a certain vision going back to last year: if it wanted to table a prudent budget in the spring, it was best to take care of its good friends, the big oil companies and banks, and be sure to give them their share of the cake with lots of icing on top before the budget. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943496"> So in the mini-budget last fall, the Conservative government gave $14 billion worth of tax cuts to big business. In its current budget, it fails to deal with a number of problems, including veterans’ spouses. The Conservative government always tells us we should support the troops on their mission in Afghanistan or elsewhere, but we should support them as well when they come back to Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943497"> For example, there is a very regrettable situation insofar as our veterans are concerned. The Liberal government of the time recognized that veterans’ spouses should qualify for the VIP or Veterans Independence Program. However, it applies only to the spouses of veterans who died after 1981. The spouses of veterans who died before 1981 do not qualify. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943498"> Unlike some fellow citizens living in the same city, therefore, certain veterans’ spouses are not eligible for the VIP, which provides such services snow removal and grass cutting or covers costs related to doctor’s visits. Some husbands went to war in 1939-45, but because they died before 1981, their widows are not eligible for the program. This budget does nothing at all for these families or people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943499"> There is absolutely nothing in the budget as well to help older people with their medications. These people are our own aging parents. There is nothing at all in the budget to provide them with an affordable drug program. There is also absolutely nothing to help people find affordable housing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943500"> Nor is anything being done to invest more in the training of doctors so that we can have more of them. Canada’s health care system has become so sick now that they are trying to privatize it. This is the biggest mistake that our country is making. The Americans would be happy to have a health care system like ours, but the Conservatives are selling it out to move toward U.S.-style health care. That is totally unacceptable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943501"> The government boasts about helping ordinary people in its budget: working people, middle class people, the poor. It is very important, though, to read what is on page 201 of the budget that the government presented on February 26, 2008 in the “Income tax” subsection of the “Tax revenues” section. The government boasts about significant tax cuts for individuals and working people in its budgets, but we should not forget that back in October, the official opposition helped pass $14 billion worth of tax cuts for big business. The banks, oil companies and other profitable companies are certainly very happy about that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943502"> However, when I look at page 201 of the budget, I find it hard to understand how the ordinary person is going to come out ahead. It clearly states that personal income tax will net the government $112,515 billion in 2007-08. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="943503"> That $112,515 billion is the projection for 2007-08. For 2009-10, the projection is $125,475 billion, a 12% increase for ordinary people who are in the labour market. We are not talking about Conrad Black. We are talking about ordinary people who get up and take their lunch box and go to work. The person who goes out on the land to work, the woman who gets up to go to work in a fish plant or in the tourism industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943504"> There will be a 12% increase from 2007-08 to 2009-10. I will repeat the figures because it is important to repeat them. The government will take in $112,515 billion in 2007-08 and a projected $125,475 billion in 2009-10.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943505"> When it comes to companies, it is taking in $42,405 billion, and in 2009-10 the government will take in $36,570 billion. That is a 14% decrease for big companies and a 12% increase for ordinary people. That is on page 201 of the federal government’s budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943506"> In another place, the government turned around because it was forced to in the House of Commons. I think it was somewhat embarrassed. A tax cut of $14 billion was given to big companies last year while industry was going under, be it the forestry industry or the manufacturing industry. Plants are closing everywhere. For example, there are UPM in Miramichi, Smurfit-Stone in Bathurst and AbitibiBowater. The same thing happened with Smurfit-Stone in New Richmond. Those companies closed down. When the Conservatives saw the closings, they said they were going to give a billion dollars to assist industry everywhere in Canada. A billion dollars for all of Canada, which means only $30 million for New Brunswick. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943507"> That shows that the government’s budget is not a budget to help ordinary people. And yet we hear the Conservatives saying they are proud of the budget. We now have people 65 and older who can go out to work. That is a good budget all right! The Conservatives are going to get people 65 and older back to work. That is what we are hearing from the Conservatives: that they are happy that at long last, people 65 and older are going to be able to go out to work. What we want is to put young people to work. We want to give older people a chance to retire. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943508"> The Conservatives themselves are saying that at last people 65 and older are going to be able to go out to work, and it will be good for them to have $100 more. Certainly it will be good for them, because they are not able to pay for their prescription drugs and use their cars to go to the doctor.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943509"> That is what we have come to. That is the government’s budget. That is why we are going to vote against it. It would be nice if the Liberals were here to vote and had the strength to stand up and tell the truth. They say they do not agree with the budget, but they are not voting in favour of it or are not voting at all. Tonight, we will see who— </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="943518">The reason they need the money is because of the budget that the Conservatives are coming out with, giving big breaks to big corporations but when it comes to the people who need affordable housing, they do not have it.

              <ParaText id="943543">Now I see that the government overcomplicates things. It engages in policy contortions that would make the acrobats of the Cirque du Soleil envious.

              <ParaText id="943545">In the past the government cut the GST to, as it today claims, stimulate the economy and counter a recession it did not even know was on its way. Now it says it wants to stimulate savings with a tax-free savings account, or is it trying to stimulate spending? It is hard to know. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943546">The same wizard turned a deficit in Ontario into a surplus with a wave of his wand, at least until the auditors came in to tell us it was all Conservative sleight of hand and that he had left a $5 billion deficit for the good people of Ontario. The same wizard says he is encouraging savings through the tax-free savings account to allow for more spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943547">All economists said it was folly to cut the GST. Now they say the tax-free savings account is a gimmick. The question that arises is the following. If the government believes in fostering choice, and it talks incessantly about choice for barley farmers and for families in choosing their child care, why has it not all along fostered financial choice, giving people the choice to spend or save by cutting income taxes? That is not only lowering the tax burden, but allowing taxpayers to decide for themselves what to do with those tax savings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943548">In any event the tax-free savings account will save a few wealthy Canadians a few dollars and earn Canada's banks a few extra dollars charging fees to open and manage such accounts, fees that could even wipe out the forecasted tax savings. It is smoke from the wizard behind the big blue curtain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943549">The budget provides that the government will pay down $10 billion of debt this year. That is wonderful. Let us be clear, it is important to pay down the debt. The previous Liberal government proved the importance of running surpluses and paying down the debt over and over again. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943550">What rule is the government employing to decide how much debt to repay in a given year? Why will it pay down $10 billion of debt this year then only $2 billion next year and $1 billion the year after? Where is the consistency? Where is the logic? Where is the economic good sense? How does the government decide how much debt to repay from one year to the next? How does it decide how much of the surplus to put toward Canada's $123 billion infrastructure deficit that is growing worse?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="943551">It obviously does not have a financial rule or even a simple rule of thumb that it applies from one year to the next. Maybe the wizard uses a Ouija board.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943552">As I said, the budget has no heart. It fails to address health care needs, child care or housing needs. Others have addressed these budget shortcomings in their speeches, so I will go on to the third point which is that the budget lacks courage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943553">It does not deal with the crucial issues of environmental infrastructure, especially those in the area of water treatment. I mention this because of my role as Liberal opposition water critic but also as a member of Parliament from a riding located in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence basin where water treatment issues have an important bearing on the quality of local watersheds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943554">There is nothing new in the budget for enhancing water treatment in the basin, even though the city of Montreal has recently announced plans to build a $200 million ozonization plant to disinfect Montreal's waste water and improve water quality in the St. Lawrence. The city, incidentally, has also committed to upgrading its water distribution system which is old and leaking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943555">To illustrate the glaring need for investments in Canada's water treatment infrastructure, one need only refer to a recent study by Statistics Canada on the state of this country's municipal infrastructure. The study showed that while the average age of public infrastructure, such as roads and bridges, has been falling in most provinces for the past seven years, there are ongoing needs in the area of water infrastructure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943556">Canada's stock of water treatment plants declined by 1.1% a year on average from 2001 to 2007. As a result, the average age of this infrastructure has edged up from 17.4 to 17.8 years. Last year 63% of waste water treatment assessments had passed their useful life. Moreover, while the stock of sanitary and storm sewers has increased 1% a year on average since 2001, this growth rate was not large enough to reverse their aging as the average age reached a record high of 17.9 years in 2007.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943557">More specifically, the government needs to invest in upgrading water and waste water treatment in Ontario's areas of concern and in the zone d'intervention prioritaire in the St. Lawrence. According to Environment Canada, $3 billion is required over the next five years for plant upgrades in these areas, $2.4 billion for the areas of concern and $0.6 billion for the zone d'intervention prioritaire. I believe the federal government should cover half of this amount with the provinces of Quebec and Ontario providing the other half.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943558">When one considers Great Lakes sites in Ontario outside the areas of concern, figures from the ministry of public infrastructure renewal in Ontario have indicated an infrastructure deficit of approximately $15.7 billion in water and waste water treatment. The total water and waste water infrastructure deficit for Ontario as a whole over the next 15 years will be $34 billion, including the areas of concern, of which $25 billion is required for renewal of infrastructure and $9 billion for new additional infrastructure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943559">According to the Green Budget Coalition, 80% of this funding is required for the Great Lakes basin. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943560">In conclusion, the budget leaves a lot to be desired. In essence, what we witnessed was less a serious financial exercise than a performance with little meaningful content.</ParaText>

I was kind of surprised to hear some of the comments that the member was making, especially because the party that is now in opposition was always saying it was for municipalities. It was always talking about the importance of infrastructure. But when it comes to actually putting the money where its mouth is, it seems to be somehow absent, and I use that term loosely.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="943564">Mr. Speaker, first, concepts like gas tax transfers, making them permanent, and money for infrastructure for communities and cities are all Liberal concepts. The government is operating within the framework of Liberal ideas because it has no ideas of its own. As the <I>Globe and Mail</I> has said, the policy cupboard is bare.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="943569">The Liberal Party has had the member for <Affiliation DbId="78686" Type="2">York Centre</Affiliation> travelling the country, saying that the Liberals really care about fighting poverty and that this time they really mean it. Yet, the Liberals are going to allow the budget to pass, and that does nothing to lift the poor out of their current condition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943570">The government's answer to lifting poor seniors out of poverty was to tell them to get a job. Instead of raising the GIS, it said that it would not claw back the first $3,500 of income earned. That is not what seniors wanted. Seniors wanted an increase in the GIS.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943571">Let me provide a couple of other examples.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="943575">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be given the opportunity to speak to budget 2008, a budget, as in previous Conservative budgets, that has let Canadians down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943576">As a member of the official opposition, my job is to critically evaluate the performance of the Conservative government and hold it to account, and that is an easy job. It is an easy job to show how incompetent and incapable the Conservative government is. However, only exposing the weaknesses of the Conservative government is not good enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943577"> I think Canadians expect other members of Parliament to put forward their own ideas, to inspire them and to show a vision and ideas that will advance Canada further and improve the welfare of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943578"> Therefore, I want to take this opportunity to focus on what I think a Liberal budget would contain. By the way, it is not because I am afraid of being sued by the Conservatives. It is because I think a lot of my colleagues here today have shown and exposed a lot of the weaknesses in the budget, and I have done that in my previous speeches. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943579">Today I want to talk about what a Liberal budget would contain. It certainly would contain a lot of items that would advance Canada and would make it an even better place than it is today. It would pay attention to the concerns with which Canadians deal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943580">We have issues of the economy, the environment, infrastructure, health care, affordable housing, post-secondary education, smart integration for immigrants and poverty. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943581">Let us start with the economy. There is very little doubt that we are heading toward uncertain economic times. A lot of industries are struggling, particularly the manufacturing industry, especially in Ontario. My riding hires about 50% of the jobs, so it is a very important segment of the industry of our economy, not only in Mississauga but also in the rest of Ontario and across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943582">What is the role of the government when a sector of the economy faces some challenges? There are two ideologies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943583">One ideology believes that a government has no role, that it should not intervene and that it should let the so-called marketplace forces get rid of certain industries or fix certain industries. In the meantime, jobs are lost and industries are devastated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943584">On the other hand, some people believe government can play a positive role in society and can help smooth out transitions and help facilitate economic growth. If one believes in that, one believes the government, during these uncertain times, has a role to play to facilitate the transition or the challenges that manufacturing industries go through.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943585">We know they are temporary. We know they are part of the economic cycles. The best thing for a government to do is to smooth out that transition, so in the future, the manufacturing sector can carry the burden for other sectors that may struggle, and continue to pay taxes and create jobs for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943586">A Liberal budget would have contained incentives to create an environment for private investment. It would have created some form of partnership. It would have created tax incentives to attract domestic and foreign investment. Other countries do that. Canada is falling behind. Given the ongoing economic and international economic conditions, our jobs are being transferred somewhere else because the government is not doing what it needs to be doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943587">It also would have created a healthier environment for research and development. For example, in our system currently, there are tax credits for companies that invest in research and development, but those tax credits are not refundable. They can only get them accredited against a profit. Currently some of the manufacturing companies are not experiencing any profits because of the downturn. The forestry industry as well is not seeing any profits, again because it is facing some challenges. What does that do? It disincentivizes them from what they need to be doing, which is focusing on research and development and building for the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943588">A Liberal budget would introduce some form of partially refundable tax incentive, which would mean that a corporation would get some of the tax credit refunded before they would be able to record a profit to help it sustain that research initiative so it could build for the future.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="943589">On the environment, there is very little argument, even from the Conservatives, that climate change is a big global challenge. Canadians expect their government to take a leadership role on that file.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943590">A Liberal budget would introduce measures, not only to set targets for greenhouse gas emissions, but to create incentives for industries and individuals so they would be able to reach those targets. It is a similar to the manufacturing industry. We are going through a transitional period, from our current practices, whether at an industrial or at a consumer level, to a much more conscious level of carbon emissions and environmental footprints. We need a government to play a positive role in the transition period, and a Liberal government would have done that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943591">We heard a lot over the last while about the infrastructure deficit our country faces. Canadian cities are the economic engines of our economy. It is important that a government supports its cities in providing services, like roads, schools, community centres and bridges, so that the economic engine is sustained and is able to grow. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943592"> This is not just important for the people who live in cities. This is important for people who live in Canada. Everybody relies on those economic engines, whether we live in cities or in rural areas. Therefore, it is important for a government to play a partnership role with cities so they are able to confront the challenge of infrastructure deficit and build for the future. We do not want to leave the country worse off to our next generation than we have inherited. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943593"> I am proud to say that our leader, the <Affiliation DbId="105459" Type="96">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>, has made a courageous and innovative announcement about investment in infrastructure. Therefore, again it comes down to what we believe in, whether we believe that a federal government has a role to play in facilitating the economic, social and environmental growth of a country or not. The Liberal Party does and would have introduced in a Liberal budget measures to invest in infrastructure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943594">On health care, today the medical associations are on the Hill. They have told us about the shortage of doctors and nurses. This is something where the federal government can also play a role in partnership with our provinces. This is an issue to which the Liberal government paid lot of attention to in the past. In 2005 the former prime minister signed a $41 billion deal with the provinces to increase investment in health care. I can assure members that a Liberal budget would have contained a substantive measure to invest in health care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943595">I know I am running out of time, so I want to talk about an issue that is very much debated, and that is payment toward debt. Canadians discuss this all the time. How do we use the surplus?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943596">This year's surplus was close to $13 billion. A Liberal government, as it has historically done, would have approached it in a balanced approach. We would have paid down part of the debt, but we also would have recognized the fact that the country has severe needs and aspirations. We would have invested in the future of our country. We would have invested in infrastructure, as I said. We would have invested in the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943597">While it is important to keep the debt down, it is also important to invest in the future. Again, it is not only good for us but it is essential for future generations.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="943622">I know she cares as much about seniors' issues as I do and I can understand why she has left the Bloc Québécois after considering its complete and utter inability to do anything but talk. It has accomplished absolutely nothing in its time in Ottawa and the frustration must be overwhelming. However, she can rest assured that this government is getting the job done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943623">At the outset I want to say that our record over the past 24 months has been one of action. We have laid out a plan and we are implementing it. This stands in stark contrast to 13 years of Liberal rule where seniors' issues were talked about but little action was taken.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="943624"> That is not how the government works. On the contrary, just like the hon. member of the opposition, we are truly concerned about the financial and social welfare of our senior citizens and we take action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943625"> That is why we have taken measures to improve the quality of life of seniors. Now, under the government’s leadership, seniors are receiving higher benefits through the guaranteed income supplement and the old age security programs than they ever received under the Liberal government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="943626">One of the first things this government did upon our election in 2006 was to implement an increase to the guaranteed income supplement, or GIS, that totalled 3.5% annually for all GIS recipients, including those my colleague across the way specifically mentions in this motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943627">We did this again in January 2007. This measure is providing more than $400 extra for a single recipient and almost $700 for a couple. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943628">This amounts to an increase in the GIS of $2.7 billion over five years. That is the type of action the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78894" Type="2">Rimouski-Neigette—Témiscouata—Les Basques</Affiliation> was asking for, but the impact is much more positive and affects more seniors than the narrow measures outlined in this motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943629">We did not stop there. We have also doubled the tax based pension income credit from $1,000 to $2,000. This increase benefits nearly 2.7 million seniors who receive eligible pension income, providing up to $155 per pensioner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943630"> The actions of this government have resulted in the removal of more than 85,000 pensioners from the tax rolls. Certainly that is something to be proud of.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="943631"> In terms of benefits for seniors, when we contrast the progress of this government with Motion M-383 to apply the money recovered from overpayments to an increase in GIS payments, we see that the estimated increase would be only $1.70 per month for each GIS recipient. That is because overpayments are extremely rare. In fact, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78851" Type="2">Kamloops—Thompson—Cariboo</Affiliation> mentioned that only a few moments ago on the subject of these payments. That figure will decrease dramatically as a result of our government’s plans to modernize the program.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="943632">The Government of Canada has long identified the needs of low income seniors as a key priority. This attention has clearly paid off. Canada's pension system is the envy of the world. Our country's mix of public and private pensions has been universally recognized as a highly effective way for countries to provide for retirement income needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943633"> However, this alone is not good enough for our government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943634">That is why we acted to help seniors protect their retirement income savings. In budget 2007, we increased the RRSP-RPP maturation age limit to 71 years of age from 69 so that older persons can shelter their tax-free investments for a longer period. Canadian seniors told us they wanted this done and we listened. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943635">The proof is in the pudding. The incidence of low income among Canadian seniors is among the lowest in the developed world. We have fewer lower income seniors than the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany and the United States, to mention just a few. Canada can take pride in this major achievement.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="943636"> Nevertheless, we are still finding ways to improve the lives of our seniors, not only economically but also in other aspects of their lives. In 2007, our government created the position of Secretary of State (Seniors. She works very closely with the National seniors Council to help identify policies that will respond to the needs of seniors. Unlike the previous government, which made great speeches and then hesitated and dragged its feet about implementing its policies, our government asks seniors what they want and then takes action.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="943637">The creation of the National Seniors Council and the Secretary of State for Seniors are examples of our government's deep commitment to seniors' issues. To further illustrate this, we have committed an additional $10 million per year to the new horizons for seniors program, which will help seniors to continue making valuable contributions to their communities and their country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943638">This program funds projects led by seniors within community based organizations. It is a grassroots approach. Seniors share their skills, wisdom and experience to their benefit and that of the community at large. By funding local projects, the program ensures that seniors have opportunities to participate and thrive in their communities. Many of these projects are designed to reach out to isolated seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943639">The <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> announced last week that budget 2008 would commit $13 million to fund projects that will raise awareness of elder abuse and fight to ensure that those who built this country are not taken advantage of. The remaining new horizons for seniors program funds will provide capital assistance for community buildings and equipment used in delivering seniors' programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943640">Budget 2008 represents the most significant advance in ensuring the economic security of Canadian seniors of any budget in the past decade. Last week, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> announced that this government would increase the earned income exemption of GIS recipients to $3,500 from the current $500.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="943641"> The Canadian Association of Retired Persons applauded the government for having listened to retired people on that score. Sean Sprackett, of Ernst &amp; Young, said that for people receiving the guaranteed income supplement, this budget measure will be a real help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943642"> When it is time to support this budget, I hope the hon. member will recognize the importance of these measures and the extent to which they will help low-income seniors.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="943643">Once again, I thank the hon. member for the opportunity to examine new measures to support seniors. This government is interested in listening to any new ideas from all members of the House, because a good idea is a good idea.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943644">While we cannot support the motion, I ask the member to please be assured that we will continue to look at initiatives that seek to improve the well-being of Canada's seniors, because they deserve a government that does more than just talk about the issues. I will point out that the sponsor of the bill actually voted against the budget that would bring in many of these measures that are so important to seniors.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="943646">Mr. Speaker, I am truly delighted to speak in support of the motion by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78894" Type="2">Rimouski-Neigette—Témiscouata—Les Basques</Affiliation> asking Parliament to review the old age security program with a view to putting a system in place that would not require seniors to repay their benefits, and paying the savings the program achieves to guaranteed income supplement recipients, giving priority to single, divorced and widowed seniors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943647"> Many of those seniors are women.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="943648">According to a Statistics Canada profile of seniors, in 2005 women accounted for 52% of persons aged 65 to 69 and almost 76% of persons aged 90 or older. Men are catching up to women in their longevity. Between 1981 to 2005, numbers of men between 80 and 84 years increased to 39% of seniors. They had previously been at 37%. By 2021, they could account for 43%.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="943649"> The motion calls on the government not only to improve the guaranteed income supplement, but also to give special attention to seniors who did not have an opportunity to prepare for retirement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943650"> We are talking about people who have always lived below the poverty line—single seniors who never married, or divorced or widowed seniors, some of whom worked in the home or worked for minimum wage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943651"> So if the government truly intends to help seniors, this motion with give it the direction it needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943652"> The direction laid out in the motion means allowing seniors who want to continue working, who need to continue working and who are able to work to do so without suffering a financial penalty. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943653"> Let us use the scarce resources we have at present, because to all appearances the Conservative government has spent the surplus accumulated by the Liberals when we were in government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943654"> Some seniors would like to be able to continue working part-time without jeopardizing their pensions or their guaranteed income supplement, particularly seniors who live in housing where the cost keeps going up exponentially.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943655"> There is a shortage of affordable housing for seniors.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="943656">In 2004 the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation told us that even though 2001 census results confirmed that the majority of Canadian households lived in housing that was affordable, uncrowded and in a good state of repair, even though fewer households were in core housing need in 2001 than in 1996, and even though the percentage of Canadian households in core housing need fell from 17.9% to 15.8%, the incidence of core housing need remains high among four segments of the population: seniors aged 65 or over living alone, lone parents with children under 18 living at home, aboriginal households, and recent immigrants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943657">If the government is really as concerned about seniors as it professes to be and if the government is really concerned about accountability, as it has repeated endlessly, it must be accountable to the seniors of the country, to the seniors of my riding of <Affiliation DbId="78983" Type="2">Davenport</Affiliation>, and to seniors of cities throughout the country. It must use those remaining resources to target the seniors who cannot afford not to work without penalizing them financially.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943658">This motion is very similar to that proposed by the Liberal women's caucus and is part of our party's policy.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="943659"> The Liberal Women’s Caucus Pink Book recommended that seniors be allowed to earn income, including RRSP withdrawals, equal to 10 times the benefits they receive from the old age pension, the OAP, and the guaranteed income supplement, the GIS, before having their GIS reduced. Ten per cent of those two benefits would amount to about $1,400.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943660"> The Pink Book also recommended that the guaranteed income supplement application form be eliminated. All the information is available on the income tax return.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943661"> It also recommended dividing the GIS cheque in proportion to a couple’s income. For example, if one individual earns 80% of the income, he or she would get 20% of the GIS and the spouse would get 80%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943662"> The Pink Book also recommended working with the provinces to eliminate the 11-month limit on retroactive payment that now applies to Canada pension plan benefits. That change means that a person who applies late for CPP would not be penalized.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="943663">In conclusion, while I agree with the sentiments in this motion, I would like to ask for the Speaker's indulgence to allow a friendly amendment to the main motion in order to clarify it.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="943678">Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to say that we support the motion moved by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78894" Type="2">Rimouski-Neigette—Témiscouata—Les Basques</Affiliation> as amended by our colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78983" Type="2">Davenport</Affiliation>. We will vote in favour of this motion as amended because, first of all, we believe in it as a political party and because this motion reflects the will of the thousands of seniors we consulted in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943679">The hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="105599" Type="2">Repentigny</Affiliation>, a Bloc Québécois member, has been making the rounds in Quebec since last fall and meeting with seniors in various forums, as well as social groups that advocate for seniors, particularly community groups. In my own riding, Chambly—Borduas, on February 11, 2008, the hon. member for Repentigny came to meet with over 200 people. I accompanied him to consult them on their financial situation and the conditions they are living in. The motion not only corresponds to their wishes, but above all, it corrects the shortcomings that cause many seniors to live in situations of poverty, situations that are embarrassing for Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943680"> At the same time, I also want to congratulate and thank all those seniors’ groups in Quebec and Canada. Particularly in Quebec, we see the leaders of these seniors’ groups who really do take care of our more disadvantaged citizens. On February 27, the day after the budget was tabled Ernest Boyer, the president of FADOQ, the Quebec federation of seniors, said what he thought about it. He said virtually word for word that there was nothing in the budget to help the poorest, most disadvantaged seniors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943681"> This motion is very pertinent, therefore, to the lives of our seniors and to the debate in the House that was just ended by the budget vote. It is appalling to see just how insensitive this government is to the situation in which our seniors find themselves. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943682"> I just heard one of our Conservative colleagues saying much the same thing as we do about the compassion we should all have for our economically most disadvantaged seniors. He came to the conclusion, though, that ultimately the Conservatives will not do anything for them. At the same time, how could we forget the words of the Conservative member this afternoon who said that seniors are good and strong and could go to work? One hon. member said this afternoon that they need good, strong people out in Alberta and he knew some over 70 years old who could go to work. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943683"> This reflects the attitude toward seniors in the budget, which includes a tax break for seniors who go to work but nothing for those who cannot. We know very well, though, that the seniors who are worst off are those who cannot work because of their age and the fact that their past working conditions left them physically worn out. Not everybody has been lucky enough to have a job that is socially useful but not very physically demanding. Most of the older working people in Canada had employment conditions that compromised their physical condition. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="943684"> I am talking about people in their early 60s. For example, I have met women who worked in the fishing industry in the Gaspésie and are between 55 and 60 now. Most of them have trouble getting up in the morning because their arthritis is so bad. Why? They worked in water all their lives. We do not work in water here. Anyone with any sense who is aware of the long-term effects of cold water on the body knows that it affects the ends of the nerves, causing them to shrink over time and leading directly to arthritis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943685"> I have been talking about fishers but could mention lumberjacks as well. It is pretty rare to see a lumberjack over 60 who does not have problems with arthritis or something else. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943686"> Now that these people have finally stopped working, the government is asking them to go back. In addition to being retrained, they would have to be physically able to work. These are the people we are talking about. There is nothing in the budget to help them, nor even the slightest willingness on the part of the Conservatives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943687"> The motion is very similar to the bill recently tabled by my colleague for <Affiliation DbId="105599" Type="2">Repentigny</Affiliation>, Bill <Document DbId="3155919" Type="4">C-490</Document>, which provides for the automatic registration of people who are eligible for the guaranteed income supplement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943688"> We know that the government has deprived the most needy seniors of an income. In total, the government is holding on to $3.3 billion that belongs to seniors. In Canada, 135,000 people are entitled to the guaranteed income supplement but are not receiving it. In Quebec, there are still 43,000 people in that situation. People who are eligible should be enrolled automatically and receive the money that is owed to them, but the Government of Canada, Liberals and Conservatives alike, refuses to give it to them, even though it belongs to them. This is a very grave injustice. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943689"> The Bloc Québécois bill calls for an increase of $110 per month for those receiving the guaranteed income supplement. This supplement has not been raised for a long time. The government proposes about $8 or $10 a month. That is nothing to the people who are in need. An increase of $110 is not a lot, but for them it is still significant. Often, that will determine whether they have to go begging for money. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943690"> The bill also calls for full retroactivity for the people affected, as I stated previously, as well as a compensatory period for guaranteed income supplement recipients who suffer the loss of their spouse. We propose that, as a means of adapting to their new financial situation, they would be paid the supplement that their deceased spouse would have received for a period of six months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943691"> In short, our position in relation to the motion before us is complementary to our position regarding the bill tabled by my colleague. That is to say, the motion supports part of our bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943692"> We must point out the great distinction between the political will to achieve something for seniors and simply making a speech in favour of seniors. We can see that difference in this House, listening to the Conservatives and, in practical terms, reading the budget that has just been adopted. That is one of the reasons we voted against this budget. This budget devotes everything to the debt, to the war, to nuclear power and the oil companies, but shows no compassion for seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943693"> Some will argue that I am tying together two debates, but the policy of the Conservatives regarding seniors begins with the issue of the guaranteed income supplement and extends to the treatment of older workers who lose their jobs and receive no income support when their employment insurance has expired.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943694"> A famous politician said that a society is judged by the way it treats its children and its seniors. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="943695"> Allow me to say that the two governments who have succeeded each other at the federal level will be judged very severely in terms of their treatment of seniors. That is the reason why we will be voting in favour of the motion as amended.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="943696">Mr. Speaker, Motion M-383 asks the government to review and improve the old age security program for Canadian seniors. It is high time and we will be supporting the motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943697">It is vital that we have this debate because the federal policy with regard to seniors has a number of serious shortcomings which allow too many of our seniors to fall through the cracks. And this will continue unless we make changes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943698">The Canadian Institute of Actuaries and Waterloo University recently concluded that two-thirds of Canadian households planning to retire in 2030 will not have saved enough to defray their essential living expenses during their retirement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943699">The <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> may believe that everyone is able to save $5,000 each year, but that is not at all the case.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="943700">Fifty-eight per cent of respondents to a local radio show in Victoria said they could only dream of the day they had $5,000 of discretionary cash. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943701">We clearly need a comprehensive review of OAS and other income supports for seniors, a review that is done regularly so it reflects the changing needs and circumstances that seniors face in different parts of the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943702">The Victoria group Women Elders in Action testified before the finance committee last fall that in 2004, 40% of women workers held non-standard jobs commonly offering low wages without security and without benefits. The warning that they should expect to work until 67 or even 73 to achieve some semblance of economic security fits conveniently with the government's desire to have aging workers stay in the workforce longer. It is not surprising then that the only budget provision related to seniors was to get seniors to work longer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943703">It is these small changes that the Liberals do not mind supporting in the budget because they seem inoffensive, but behind them we have to see the larger project of Tom Flanagan and the Fraser Institute incrementally moving Canada toward a more conservative state. Before we know it, the logical next step will be to delay public pensions to age 70. I am not prepared to start down that road.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943704">The NDP's seniors first motion would take us in the other direction, to protect, respect and support seniors. It passed the House in June 2006 and 20 months later, we have no action from the government, other than a new National Seniors Council which is apparently very slow to act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943705">Seniors in my riding are exceptionally aware and astute about politics. They know that what we do here in Ottawa affects their everyday lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943706">In January, the NDP's seniors critic, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78613" Type="2">Hamilton Mountain</Affiliation>, came for a day to Victoria. She and I exchanged concerns with over 150 people, including a very productive session with representatives of Victoria's seniors groups.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943707">We heard during that session that seniors are impacted by a number of big issues, such as the desperate lack of affordable housing in Victoria, the doctor shortage, the sky-high cost of necessary prescription drugs, inadequate home care and long term care to allow them to stay at home longer, and a shameful lack of financial supports for in-home caregivers who sacrifice so much to be there for family and friends in their moment of need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943708">We heard about a marked decline in service from the federal government ever since Service Canada replaced specialized support staff with expert knowledge on seniors programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943709">We heard how the federal government does a poor job of informing seniors about their eligibility for CPP, income support and the disability tax credit. Fifty thousand seniors missed out on old age security and other supports in 2004, and close to one million Canadians who are eligible for the disability tax credit simply do not know about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943710">I hosted a workshop on the disability tax credit last fall and as a result, some individuals are now receiving benefits they would never have known existed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943711">We heard how the federal government is refusing to pay back seniors for an error in calculating the consumer price index which shortchanged countless seniors on their CPP and income support payments. As it is, we know that seniors get a bad deal from inflation calculations that do not reflect the real cost of living increases they face. Now the government refuses to account for its own mistake. We also heard calls to move toward including alternative and complementary medicine in health care plans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943712">Most of these problems are well-known because they have been raised by seniors for a long time and by the NDP, but we still have no action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943713">These needs are just some of the reasons it is also important to support the incredible work by seniors organizations across Canada that try to help seniors deal with these issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943714">Communities across Canada have groups like Victoria's New Horizons groups, Greater Victoria Seniors, Silver Threads, Seniors Helping Seniors and Oak Bay Volunteer Services. I could spend my whole 10 minutes telling this House about the tremendous and invaluable work done by these groups in Victoria.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="943715">Seniors organizations have told me over and over again that they need long term core funding to more effectively and efficiently provide the services that seniors desperately need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943716">The current project-based scheme imposed by the federal government forces these largely volunteer run groups to spend far too much of their time and energy applying for grants instead of delivering programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943717">The worst part of the system is that the groups are not allowed to apply for the same project from year to year. They are forced to come up with new proposals every 12 months instead of continuing and extending their proven projects to reach more and more seniors in need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943718">Just yesterday the Canadian Public Health Association released a report from its 15 member expert panel on health literacy stating that 88% of Canadian seniors would benefit from stronger health literacy skills, that is, the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943719">Carolyn Altridge, a retired RN in Victoria, told me that she regularly sees errors made in taking medication, with enormous costs to seniors' health and to the whole health care system overall.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943720">Among the CPHA report's solutions were community grassroots initiatives such as the ones promoted and provided by Victoria's seniors organizations and centres. The very groups that could help address the health literacy gap are the ones the government is starving.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943721">These are not start-up NGOs. They have been in business for years. They know the community and they know what works. They do not need seed money to become independent organizations. They need stable, long term funding to do their work of helping seniors stay independent as long as they can.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943722">In some cases they have had to hire a full time employee just to manage the onerous application and reporting process to the federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943723">No one is saying that these groups should not be accountable for their funding, but simply that they should have some time left after filling out all the government forms to actually deliver the programs. They should be trusted by the government to know what works best in their field, instead of being micromanaged.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943724">They are major on the ground solutions to many of the problems I mentioned today, including that of health literacy, and I firmly believe that respect for our seniors has to start with respect for the organizations that represent and serve our seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943725">It is an insult that the budget only mentions seniors in the context of getting them to work longer. If we mean it when we say that seniors deserve to retire with dignity and respect, we have to start showing it. This motion is the beginning of making some much needed changes to the old age security system and my colleagues and I will strongly support it.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="78894" Type="2">Ms. Louise Thibault (Rimouski-Neigette—Témiscouata—Les Basques, Ind.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="943726">Mr. Speaker, I am quite pleased to draw these two hours of debate to a close, first by thanking all our colleagues who spoke and shared their points of view. Although we do not all hold the same opinion, this democratic exercise will at least have had the advantage of allowing citizens, seniors in particular, to see what their representatives truly stand for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943727">Canadians will also have had the opportunity—unfortunately, in one sense—to listen to the Conservative nonsense on two occasions. And I would like to say to Canadians that one never gets used to it, although that is no consolation. I will never get used to the fact that a government with the means does not have the will to safeguard Canadians against poverty and to help them live with dignity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943728">My motion contains possible solutions. It asks the government to accept the principle of a program review, based on specific, although not exhaustive, suggestions that will stop us from aggravating the poverty of our most disadvantaged seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943729">In the budget adopted this evening, the government included an exemption on the first $3,500 of income in calculating the guaranteed income supplement. This exemption is certainly modelled after the last part of my motion, although it is quite a bit less generous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943730"> However, the problem has to be seen from a wider angle. The new measure in the budget will help seniors who want to continue working, but the budget contains nothing new for single seniors living in poverty. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943731"> The government had the resources to give them a significant increase that would at least have brought them above the poverty line.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943732"> My motion is supported by the signatures of more than 7,000 people throughout eastern Quebec, who want the people in charge of the program and the people in Parliament to think about the extremely distressing situation of seniors who are receiving the guaranteed income supplement. The voice of the people is speaking. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943733"> I want to repeat one aspect of my speech that I believe to be important. When I spoke to my motion, I tried very sincerely to raise the tone of the debate above partisanship. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943734"> I believe I succeeded, up to a point, but unfortunately the Conservatives have been using this place for two years to engage in self-aggrandizement instead of genuinely discussing how they could make a lasting improvement in the lives of the people for whom they are responsible, and in particular seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943735"> It is absolutely scandalous, given that there are thousands of seniors living below the poverty line, that the Conservatives would dare to brag that they have done a better job, in their own opinion, than previous governments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943736"> Although the <Affiliation DbId="78951" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources</Affiliation> said at the outset of her speech, and I quote, “...we welcome any input from the opposition”, she set about trying to tear down the suggestions I made, as her colleague did tonight as well, but more than anything, she went on about what she said was “good news”, that Canada has the lowest poverty rate among seniors in the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943737"> Not only will seniors living on the guaranteed income supplement find nothing for them here, but they will be insulted to hear things like that being said. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943738"> I am not concerned about the fact that the poverty rate for seniors is the lowest in the world, I am concerned about the fact that there is still poverty in a country as rich as this. The Conservative government is putting all its energy into reducing the debt, but if that debt is the lowest in the world, why not work on truly reducing poverty in this country?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943739"> My opposition colleagues have offered constructive criticism. Some of them wanted to quantify seniors’ lost earnings, others had problems with certain terms used, and the Liberals presented an amendment and I accepted it because it did nothing to detract from my original motion or the essence of that motion, which is obviously to improve guaranteed income supplement benefits and allow for 15 hours of work. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943740"> Beyond the words, beyond the terms, beyond the possible solutions that have been suggested, there is the intention and there is the action that can be taken. That is what my motion is about: tackling the entire problem of poverty among our seniors by providing them with dignified, honourable, decent benefits that are worthy of the name.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943741"> In conclusion, I would like to say that this motion can be achieved, it is realistic, and it is time to act. I would like once again to thank the member who seconded my motion, the member for <Affiliation DbId="105598" Type="2">London North Centre</Affiliation>. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="943757"> The House of Commons could do without the jeers of the hon. members opposite. It could also do without the smugness that surrounds the Conservative government. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="943759"> We all remember the O'Brien affair. I will summarize what happened. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943760"> In the last mayoralty race in Ottawa, candidate Larry O'Brien allegedly approached his rival Terry Kilrea. Why? To dangle before him the possibility of getting him a job on the National Parole Board and paying some of his election expenses in return for Mr. Kilrea’s withdrawal from the race. The two men exchanged emails about this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943761"> The <I>Ottawa Citizen</I> has followed this saga and helped identify the main participants in it. Apart from the two principals, the following names have surfaced: Ms. Heather Tessier, who is Mr. O'Brien’s niece, a former executive assistant for Mayor O'Brien, and, according to the <I>Ottawa Sun</I>, a former executive assistant to the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78377" Type="2">Nepean—Carleton</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="78964" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943762"> The <Affiliation DbId="105835" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation> apparently met Mayor O'Brien at Hy's Steakhouse. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943763"> Mr. Dimitri Pantazopoulos has long been close to the Conservatives and is the president of Praxicus Public Strategies. He is said to have approached Mr. Kilrea in this matter. According to The <I>Ottawa Citizen</I>, he mentioned a possible job but said it would have to wait until after the election. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943764"> Mr. John Reynolds was the co-chair of the Conservative Party’s 2006 election campaign. He supposedly spoke with Mr. O'Brien about this but claims he never pursued the matter. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943765"> Mr. John Light is the political assistant of the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78377" Type="2">Nepean—Carleton</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="78964" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation>. He supposedly said that Mr. O'Brien’s campaign team was secretly working to persuade Mr. Kilrea to drop out of the race. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="943782">Mr. Speaker, I want to use this adjournment debate to return to an issue I raised last November. I denounced the Service Canada advertisement in which two retired people literally bump into a Service Canada counter on a curling rink. When I saw that commercial on television, I was outraged that the Conservative government was spending fantastic amounts of money on advertising instead of allocating that money to really helping seniors. We are aware that there are still a great many seniors who are eligible for the guaranteed income supplement but do not know it. If we looked for them perhaps we would find them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943783"> Despite the surplus available to the government; despite its obligation to redistribute that collective wealth, the financial situation of thousands of seniors whose only income is the combined old age security and guaranteed income supplement benefits continues to get worse. As we know, thousands of seniors are eligible for the guaranteed income supplement but do not know it. In fact, they are being deprived of it. Even though the government has made some changes in its procedures, it is not enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943784"> The government must employ the resources necessary to reach these people who could receive the guaranteed income supplement. Service Canada staff should be out on the ground to find these people and help them fill out the forms. This is local work that demands a serious and sustained effort. The staff certainly will not find destitute seniors in curling rinks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943785"> The government must administer public funds prudently and without seeking to advance its political interests. Taxpayers' money should go to those who need it and not to advertising agencies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943786"> When we think of the insufficient benefits, when we know that seniors whose only income is those benefits are living below the poverty line, and that thousands of people who are eligible are not receiving benefits, that kind of waste on advertising is unacceptable and shameful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943787"> Who could serious claim that such advertising is effective? It does not deal in any way with the problems of older people, whom it is exploiting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943788"> From the Auditor General’s report of November 2006, we have learned, and I quote:</ParaText>

Why did the Conservative government not take more effective measures to ensure that it would reach seniors in need?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943791">In the end, the formula is the same from one government to the next: look like it is doing something without actually doing it or intending to achieve results. Not only is that upsetting, it is unacceptable. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="943792">Mr. Speaker, my remarks are going to be very brief because I spoke to this issue just last week during the debate on the hon. member's Motion No. 383. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943793">I want to point out again that the federal government proactively contacts millions of Canadian seniors to inform them of the benefits to which they are entitled. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943794">I have to point out to the member that we have done a lot for seniors. We have given seniors their own secretariat and their own voice at the cabinet table. We have acted very quickly to support seniors issues. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943795">Within months after being elected, we introduced Bill <Document DbId="2521443" Type="3">C-36</Document> which strengthened the CPP and the old age security programs. We simplified that application process. We had many changes. We reduced the number of seniors living in poverty. The government has overseen two increases in the guaranteed income supplement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943796">Effective January 2006, we raised the GIS by 3.5% and raised it again in January 2007. These measures are providing all single recipients of the guaranteed income supplement with an additional $430 per year and $700 per couple. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943797">These increases will raise the total guaranteed income supplement by more than $2.7 billion in the next five years. These increases will benefit 1.6 million guaranteed income supplement recipients. This is more than 50,000 seniors who were not eligible for the program under the previous Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="943798">In closing, I want to thank the hon. member across the way for her question, but I want to assure the member that Canadian seniors have finally found a government that really is interested in their issues and is responding.</ParaText>

The member has sold out his constituents for the agenda of some radical interest groups that would prefer to see the Government of Canada attempt to spend the U.S. out of a potential recession and Canada back into deficit. We cannot go there.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="943821">Here is the short list of what the government has delivered. We cut corporate taxes. These were broad-based tax reductions resulting in $9 billion in tax relief.

We did that for an additional three years, which is an additional $1 billion in tax relief.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="943832">We want Canada's manufacturing sector to enjoy this economic expansion, to make the investments that will help it compete for the long term and we want it to benefit from a knowledge workforce. That is why this government is taking steps and using the steps it already has in place to support the manufacturing sector. This is a sector that will provide jobs and prosperity for many years to come.</ParaText>
