            </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4806309"> moved that Bill <Document DbId="8588471" Type="4">C-322, an act to amend the Railway Safety Act (road crossings)</Document>, be read the second time and referred to a committee.</ParaText>
              <ProceduralText TocType="TPC" id="1">Bill C-322. Second reading</ProceduralText>
              <ParaText id="4806310">She said: Mr. Speaker, my bill is very straightforward. At present, the Minister of Transport has the power to order the closure or modification of a railway crossing, level or otherwise. However, the minister does not have the power to order the construction of a new crossing around rail lines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806311">The people of Laurier—Sainte-Marie are leaders in active transportation. A lot of people use public transit, bike, or walk in order to get around. This is true throughout the island of Montreal. We do have one problem, however: a rail line runs right through the centre of the island and cuts off connecting corridors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806312">Although not used extensively, this rail line is nevertheless extremely important. However, all the infrastructure around it was built to accommodate cars. As I just said, active transportation is very common in my area, which is densely populated and very walkable. In fact, the city grew around the rail line, and this is creating some serious problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806313">I will give an example. I know that I am focusing a lot of my attention on Montreal, but I will talk about other places later. In Montreal there is a place near the offices of corporations such as Ubisoft where people have to take a detour of 800 metres, nearly a kilometre, to get to the metro station on the other side of the tracks. People tend to cross the track where there is no crossing, which is extremely dangerous. In Canada, there are twice as many fatal accidents at illegal crossings compared to safe crossings. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806314">The other day near that location, I saw a mother pushing a stroller across the tracks illegally. This is not uncommon. That is why businesses, municipalities, and citizen groups have long been calling for the construction of crossings at suitable or strategic locations to be given due consideration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806315">I mention Laurier—Sainte-Marie a lot, but in Montreal this problem also affects the people of Outremont, Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie, and Papineau. I hope the people of Papineau will share their concerns about this with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. For 20 years, citizens, municipalities, private companies, and elected officials have been calling for action on this, but to no avail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806316">When I looked at this issue because of what was happening in Montreal, I discovered a few things. I realized that this was a problem not just in Montreal, but also in Toronto and Saskatoon. This problem exists all across the country, and not just in urban areas. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806317">My colleague will probably talk later about a very good example of this problem in British Columbia, where a railway runs along the shore of Kicking Horse River. People, including employees of rafting companies, used to cross the railway to access the river. CP closed people's access, blocking the way to the river, which is one of our natural resources, to the detriment of rafting companies. They are now required to use helicopters, which increases the cost of their operations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806318">In short, this is a very common problem. The systems in place do not work. Since I was talking about British Columbia, I will quote the Minister of Jobs, Tourism, and Skills Training, and Minister Responsible for Labour for the province of British Columbia:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806319">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> From the moment the Province heard about the challenges facing the rafting season, staff have worked to find a way rafters can continue to safely cross the CP tracks in Golden. Staff have been on the ground and at the table in Golden with suggestions and solutions. CP has made it abundantly clear that it is unwilling to be a reasonable partner, despite its earlier commitment to work...to find a solution.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806320">What can the minister do in the face of such obstinacy? Nothing. He is completely powerless, as I said earlier. He has the power to order a closure or modification, but he has no power to order the construction of a new crossing. This bill simply gives the minister that power. The bill does not dictate that a crossing should be built in any particular location. It simply gives the minister the same power to create a crossing as the power to close one. It seems very reasonable to me. The minister and the appropriate bureaucrats could examine each request and each file and then make a decision based on the safety of our citizens. There are places where, some mornings, up to 500 people cross railroad tracks unsafely. The last thing we should do is wait for an accident to happen before taking action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806321">That is why the bill is so important for enhancing safety, including for cyclists and pedestrians. As I was saying, most of the network was built with cars in mind. The bill has received and continues to receive much support. It has the support of Canada Bikes, Citizen for Safe Cycling, in Ontario, Walk Toronto, Cycle Toronto, Ontario By Bike, Glacier Raft Company, Golden, B.C., Greater Victoria Cycling Coalition, BC Healthy Living Alliance, Saskatoon Cycles, Jane's Walk, in Ontario, Vélo Québec, Piétons Québec, Collectif pour les passages à niveau, and the Association of Pedestrians and Cyclists of Outremont, and other municipalities, cities, and businesses. If any of my colleagues are interested, I have a letter from Ubisoft in Montreal calling for the same thing. Again, many people and the City of Montreal have been calling for this for over 20 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806322">Given all this support, I hope we will also have the minister's support. It would be surprising, to say the least, if the minister said he did not want to provide the tools to ensure public safety. We are providing him with a tool. We are giving him a gift on a silver platter. I hope he will graciously accept this gift and use his new powers wisely. This is essentially a matter of ensuring public safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806323">In closing, I would like to read a joint statement issued by Piétons Québec, Vélo Québec, and Collectif pour les passages à niveau, which sums up the situation very well:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4806327">The last quote I read to the House mentions urban areas. However, as I mentioned earlier in my speech, there are also problems in rural areas. A Conservative member told me about the problems in Alberta.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806328">As I was saying, the only thing my bill will do is restore the balance between the minister's ability to close, change, and open grade crossings and provide him with a new tool that he will be able to use, as he sees fit, to improve the safety of Canadians.</ParaText>

Indeed, she has asked the right questions and raised a major issue for the people of her riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806333">As the MP of a riding where there was a railway tragedy, I am very sensitive to the issue of railway safety. Could my colleague elaborate on the potential risks of adding new crossings to the rail system?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806334">I believe this is one of the issues of the bill. We had the opportunity to discuss it together. I will raise this issue again this morning because every new crossing added to Canada's rail system presents risks as well. Therefore, the solution put forward may be creating new risks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806335">I would like to know whether my colleague has thought about this and what she is proposing in that regard, because the current bill does not seem to take such concerns into consideration.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4806336">Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question; perhaps I could have talked about it more in my speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806337">I actually believe the bill will serve to reduce potential risks rather than increasing them. The numbers are very clear about fatal accidents as a result of trespassing, and that is what we are seeing. Every morning, there are several hundred trespassers in one single place in Montreal, and this is not counting all the other places in the country. Fatal accidents as a result of trespassing are twice as high as those at crossings. However, a lot of crossings have been set up across the country in the past 10 to 15 years in Canada, according to the data from the Department of Transport.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806338">It will be up to the minister to do his studies and analyses. If trespassing occurs frequently in some places and it becomes clear that it is not sustainable, the solution to reduce the risks will be to provide safe crossings, which is easy to do.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4806340">I also understand why private companies might be interested in this sort of bill. The member mentioned Ubisoft and gave us a concrete example.

              <ParaText id="4806342">I will again use Montreal as an example, since that is the one I am most familiar with. Many companies like Ubisoft have expressed concerns about the safety of their employees and are asking for crossings. Several companies in the area have joined forces and are working with civil society and local elected officials to come up with a solution to this problem. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806343">Some companies have even adopted temporary solutions. For instance, if I remember correctly, Ubisoft rented a minibus to shuttle its employees between the subway station and the office. Personally, I think that is ridiculous. Small businesses cannot afford such things and are worried.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806344">Another example is the whitewater rafting companies I mentioned. In British Columbia, five rafting companies are threatening to shut down because their access to the river has been blocked.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4806345">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to Bill <Document DbId="8588471" Type="4">C-322</Document>, which would amend the Railway Safety Act and provide the <Affiliation DbId="214333" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> with an authority to order a railway company to construct a road crossing. I will explain the reasons why the government will not support the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806346">The Government of Canada does have a mandate to oversee the safety of federally regulated railway operations in Canada. Dating back to its inception in 1989, the Railway Safety Act, administered by Transport Canada, gives the current <Affiliation DbId="214333" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> direct jurisdiction over railways that fall within the legislative authority of Parliament, as well as the authority to oversee their safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806347">Transport Canada's role is to monitor regulated entities, such as federal railway companies, local railway companies, provincial railways that operate on federally regulated track, and road authorities, which can include municipalities, provinces, and band councils, for compliance with the rules, regulations, and engineering standards under the Railway Safety Act through a robust oversight program. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806348">Transport Canada also monitors for safety and has the authority to act to address threats and immediate threats to safe railway operations through various means, including ordering corrective actions. In fact, the Railway Safety Act provides both the <Affiliation DbId="214333" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> and Transport Canada railway safety inspectors with several authorities to address railway safety issues when there is a risk, threat, or concern caused by a railway operation to the safety of the public, as well as railway personnel, and the protection of property and the environment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806349">In addition, the Grade Crossings Regulations, which came into force in November 2014, contain a number of provisions that set out roles and responsibilities at federally regulated grade crossings, fostering collaboration between railway companies and road authorities toward improving safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806350"> Allow me to describe the existing authorities and mechanisms that are currently in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806351">The Railway Safety Act provides inspectors with direct authority to conduct inspections and audits and to address safety threats. The act provides authority for an inspector to issue a notice to inform a company that a threat to safety has been identified. The notice is provided to the company identifying the threat and the company must provide a response as to how it will address it. Where a threat is deemed immediate by an inspector, the Railway Safety Act also provides authority to include an order in the notice restricting the company's use of railway equipment, infrastructure, or railway operation creating the immediate threat, or allowing that operations can continue but under terms and conditions specified by the inspector until the company mitigates the immediate threat on a more permanent basis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806352">In June 2015, the Safe and Accountable Rail Act was passed, which amended the Railway Safety Act and provided a series of broader authorities for both the <Affiliation DbId="214333" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> and railway safety inspectors to better address rail safety threats, risks, and concerns. These new authorities allow inspectors to issue notices, in the event of a threat to safety, to any person or entity that has responsibility in relation to that threat, including railways, road authorities, and municipalities. Furthermore, in the event of an immediate safety threat, an inspector may issue a notice and order to any person or entity, again including railway companies, road authorities, and municipalities, and order them to take specific corrective actions to remove the immediate threat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806353">These broadened inspector authorities complement a similar authority for the <Affiliation DbId="214333" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation>. If the minister considers it necessary in the interests of safe railway operations, the minister may order the company, road authority, or municipality to stop any activity that might constitute a threat to safe railway operations, or to follow procedures, or to take corrective measures specified in the order, including constructing, altering, operating or maintaining railway work, which includes crossings. Another key consideration, in addition to these existing authorities under the Railway Safety Act, is that a process for opening new road crossings already exists.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4806354"> Whereas Transport Canada is responsible for the safety oversight of railway operations, the Canadian Transportation Agency, an independent quasi-judicial tribunal, sets the ground rules that establish the rights and responsibilities of transportation services providers and users, and resolves disputes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806355"> Rest assured that these responsibilities are complementary to addressing both safety and economic concerns with respect to rail crossings in Canada. Both organizations promote a collaborative approach for road authorities and railway companies to work together to determine whether to open a road crossing. Should discussions be unsuccessful, proponents can access services, such as mediation and adjudication, through the Canadian Transportation Agency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806356">It is important to note that agency decisions made through adjudication are legally binding and can include where crossings should be located, conditions the crossing must meet, and apportionment of the costs. In the exceptional circumstances that the minister orders the construction, alteration, operation, or maintenance of a railway work, the proponent may, if there is another beneficiary of the work, refer the allocation of liability and costs to the Canadian Transportation Agency for a determination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806357"> In either instance, once a road crossing is to be opened, the road authority and railway company are responsible for the safety of the crossing and Transport Canada is responsible for monitoring compliance to the standards and regulations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806358">Moreover, Transport Canada takes appropriate enforcement action when safety concerns or instances of non-compliance to the regulations and standards are identified. In addition to the tools already mentioned, inspectors can use administrative tools, such as letters of concern sent to railways and road authorities, in order to mitigate safety concerns. In the event of non-compliance, Transport Canada's actions may range from a letter of warning to a fine through an administrative monetary penalty to prosecution and finally to the suspension or cancellation of the company's railway operating certificate, essentially shutting down its operations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806359">To be clear, when all other avenues have been exhausted and when there are exceptional threats to safety, the <Affiliation DbId="214333" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> already has the authority, under section 32.01 of the Railway Safety Act, to order a company, road authority or municipality to, among other things, take corrective measures to address a threat to safe railway operations, including constructing a road crossing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806360"> We understand that certain communities living in close proximity to railway operations are struggling to combat willful trespassing on railway property. I believe the intention of the bill is sincere and is a way to address these trespassing issues. While the government fully understands the importance of this issue, the bill looks to amend the Railway Safety Act. However, doing so would duplicate existing authorities already in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806361">As I have mentioned, under the Railway Safety Act, the <Affiliation DbId="214333" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> has the appropriate tools and authorities to respond to safety concerns or threats to safe railway operations. I know the <Affiliation DbId="214333" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> and Transport Canada will not hesitate to exercise these delegated powers when necessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806362">It is for these reasons that the Government of Canada does not support Bill <Document DbId="8588471" Type="4">C-322</Document>.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4806363">Madam Speaker, I would first like to thank the sponsor of the bill, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214113" Type="2">Laurier—Sainte-Marie</Affiliation>, for her work on this file.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806364">I am very sympathetic to the intentions of my NDP colleague. I know that she has worked very hard and has sought the support of several stakeholders. I am convinced that she is acting for the well-being and safety of residents in the greater Montreal area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806365">As I mentioned earlier, as the representative of the municipality of Lac-Mégantic, the location of a great tragedy familiar to everyone, I pay close attention to the issue of rail safety. I am sure that many members of the House share the concerns of the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214113" Type="2">Laurier—Sainte-Marie</Affiliation> regarding the safety of people who have to cross railway tracks to travel between their places of work and their homes, for instance, or other users of the public roadways.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806366">In short, the bill before us proposes to amend the Railway Safety Act to give the <Affiliation DbId="214333" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> the power to order a company to construct a road crossing and to authorize the payment of subsidies in this regard. This bill, as I mentioned, is designed to address a particular problem in Montreal, but there are some weaknesses that I would like to discuss.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806367">The bill does not entirely eliminate the risk of accidents. It seeks to reduce the risk and the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214113" Type="2">Laurier—Sainte-Marie</Affiliation> acknowledged that. It does however give absolute and total power to the minister and imposes no framework on the minister's powers. I have some problems with that. For example, the bill does not propose using overhead rail crossings, which are a much safer solution for those who have to cross the tracks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806368">I wonder whether Bill <Document DbId="8588471" Type="4">C-322</Document>, in its current form, was necessary. Is this the solution to the illegal crossings that my colleague was talking about earlier? The Canada Transportation Act includes some provisions on rail crossings. Section 100 of the act defines crossings as follows: </ParaText>

                    <I>road crossing</I> means the part of a road that passes across, over or under a railway line, and includes a structure supporting or protecting that part of the road or facilitating the crossing.</QuotePara>
                </LegislationQuote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806370">The member for <Affiliation DbId="214113" Type="2">Laurier—Sainte-Marie</Affiliation> says that she wants to increase the safety of those affected, and I believe her approach is sincere in that respect. I do not doubt her commitment either. However, I have some questions about the method she has chosen with this bill in its current form. In my view, when we want to correct at-risk situations, we try not to create new ones.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806371">Clearly, Bill <Document DbId="8588471" Type="4">C-322</Document> first and foremost seeks to solve a serious problem in the Montreal area, but if it is passed, it will be pan-Canadian in scope. If we turn to the current Canada Transportation Act, section 101 of Part III provides instructions to that effect and certain prerogatives to the Canadian Transportation Agency. The act also provides for situations where, like in Montreal, there is no agreement between the parties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806372">In the event of an agreement, the act states:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806373">
                <LegislationQuote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">101(1) An agreement, or an amendment to an agreement, relating to the construction, maintenance or apportionment of the costs of a road crossing or a utility crossing may be filed with the Agency.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806374">We do not talk about what happens when there is an agreement, but what happens when there is no agreement? Subsection 101(3) states the following:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806375">
                <LegislationQuote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">101(3) If a person is unsuccessful in negotiating an agreement or amendment mentioned in subsection (1), the Agency may, on application, authorize the construction of a suitable road crossing, utility crossing or related work, or specifying who shall maintain the crossing.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806376">The act also stipulates that section 16 of the Railway Safety Act applies if the parties do not reach an agreement. Subsection 16(4) states the following:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806377">
                <LegislationQuote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">16(4) Where a matter is referred to the Agency under subsection (1), the Agency shall, having regard to any grant made under section 12 or 13 in respect of that matter, the relative benefits that each person who has, or who might have, referred the matter stands to gain from the work, and to any other factor that it considers relevant, determine the proportion of the liability for construction, alteration, operational and maintenance costs to be borne by each person, and that liability shall be apportioned accordingly.</QuotePara>
                </LegislationQuote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806378">In short, the current legislative framework stipulates that, if a municipality or local entity and a railway company cannot agree, the Canadian Transportation Agency may take over and assume responsibility. It can authorize the construction, and determine how the costs will be shared between the parties, both for construction and maintenance.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4806379">My understanding is that the minister can already help the parties to find common ground through the various existing programs that would mitigate the financial consequences for the stakeholders. As we know, money is often the sticking point in those kinds of negotiations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806380">The member told us about her work with the various stakeholders who support her proposed legislative amendment. I would like to share a contrary opinion that must also be considered, namely the opinion of the Montreal Port Authority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806381">The Montreal Port Authority is against the bill. The rail line affected by the member's initiative serves the port. Setting up new crossings would probably disrupt port operations. Given that a train cannot stop at a grade crossing, the port authority says that the company would have to uncouple and re-couple the trains in order to carry out those daily operations. Those operations could significantly increase the risks for company employees and the general public, not to mention the higher levels of air pollution that those handling operations could generate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806382">The situation in my colleague's riding is quite specific. Since 2013, the City of Montreal has wanted to add six level crossings on a section of the CP rail line located in the northern part of downtown Montreal. Montreal filed an application with the Canadian Transportation Agency, which is authorized to deal with such matters, as I mentioned earlier. The City of Montreal and CP were unable to reach an agreement, and the negotiations broke off a long time ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806383">The <Affiliation DbId="214333" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> might try to call the mayor of Montreal to potentially resolve the situation by trying to find a solution or becoming involved in the matter and thus avoid having to make legislative amendments. This solution is available to the minister. In her speech, the parliamentary secretary mentioned the authorities that allow the minister to intervene at present. Does the minister intend to do so? In my opinion, he already has the authority and the minister could intervene and take action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806384">To go back to Bill <Document DbId="8588471" Type="4">C-322</Document>, we have to look at the basic issue, the safety of Canadians and their families. At the moment, there are certain shortcomings in the bill. Clearly, we encourage people to comply with existing laws and regulations. Pedestrians must not cross railway tracks where they are not allowed to do so, because it is dangerous and puts not only their own lives but those of others at risk. Unfortunately, statistics show that level crossings are not risk free.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806385">I really must provide my colleague with some recommendations. Statistics show that railway and road crossings are equally dangerous for Canadians. At the end of October 2016, data from the Transportation Safety Board of Canada indicated a total of 89 accidents at road crossings, including 16 fatalities and 20 severe injuries. Our colleague talked about the high number of accidents outside road crossings. In other words: Canada's entire railway system. These are not specific locations we are talking about, but about a very large area. It is impossible to put road crossings everywhere and anywhere in Canada where there are railway lines. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806386">We do not see how Bill <Document DbId="8588471" Type="4">C-322</Document> in its current form could help to improve and solve the problem once and for all. In our view, a broader approach to road crossings is needed. I agree that specific measures must be taken to improve the situation in Montreal, and thus the safety of the people crossing railway lines illegally in Canada. We should come up with a framework within which the minister could use this new power to authorize new road crossings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806387">I offer my colleague my cooperation in the coming weeks; let us keep discussing the bill and see whether it is possible to make any improvements that would result in our being able to support it. Unfortunately, at the moment, we cannot support Bill <Document DbId="8588471" Type="4">C-322</Document> in its current form.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="214495" Type="2">Mr. Wayne Stetski (Kootenay—Columbia, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4806388">Madam Speaker, this is an important issue. Canada's railways play an important part in our nation, not only for their value of moving goods and people, but as part of our cultural identity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806389">We all know the story of the last spike and how the government worked with the Canadian Pacific Railway to build our first transcontinental railroad in 1885. That silver spike was driven into the railbed in Craigellachie, just a few kilometres west of my riding of Kootenay—Columbia. At that time, rail was the most efficient way to transport goods and people from one end of the country to the other. That is why the government played an important role in funding and building the railway.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806390">Sir John A. Macdonald's government was brought down due to his accepting bribes from CPR for helping with the railway, and he was re-elected in part due to his promise to complete the railway. After it was completed, it became popular to take the train across the country to see its sights, staying at many of the fantastic hotels that the rail company built to house wealthy guests, including Glacier Hotel in my riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806391">At that time, safety may not have been as important as it is today. It is said that Agnes Macdonald, wife of then Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald, was so thrilled with the sight of the mountains that she road the train's cowcatcher all the way through. That must have been a “mooving” experience, for sure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806392">Today we have a very different situation. The railroads are privately owned, but responsibility for their safety lies with the Government of Canada and the federal Department of Transport. However, that responsibility is currently one way. The government can order a railway to close or alter a crossing, but it cannot order the railway to create one, and that is what this legislation is about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806393">Bill <Document DbId="8588471" Type="4">C-322</Document> would grant the <Affiliation DbId="214333" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> the powers to require the construction of crossings on a rail line. Why is this important? It is important because the situation right now is untenable. Canadians, including individuals and businesses, have demonstrated that they sometimes have legitimate requirements to cross railways at locations other than currently regulated road crossings. However, the rail companies refuse to allow the crossings and they refuse to make them safe. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806394">This is especially true where rail lines run along rivers and lakes. In order to reach the waterway, people are sometimes given the choice between taking an extremely long detour or crossing the tracks illegally and unsafely. In my own riding of Kootenay—Columbia, we have a situation like this. The Kicking Horse River is an offshoot of the mighty Columbia River. It gets its colourful name from an incident in 1858, when Dr. James Hector, a member of the Palliser expedition that was exploring the area, was kicked and knocked out by a horse while trying to lead it across the fast-moving water. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806395">Whitewater rafting in the Kicking Horse River outside of Golden, B.C., is some of the best in the world. Every summer, as many as 40,000 people, assisted by a number of successful companies, load onto rafts to challenge the rapids. The sport brings valuable ecotourism dollars into Golden and provides dozens of jobs, particularly for our youth. To get to the water, rafting companies carefully lead groups across the railway tracks to the lower canyon. They have been doing so for over 40 years without a single accident. Last year, CPR told them that their activity was illegal and stopped rafters from crossing the tracks, citing safety. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806396">I will read to the House a statement from CP issued in early June 2016: “CP cannot support rafters accessing the Kicking Horse River at this location...as it poses a significant risk to their own safety as well as the safety of CP crews and the freight they are transporting.” Subsequently CP put up a metal gate barricading the crossing, and threatened to charge anyone who “trespassed”, their word, to get to the river. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806397">Let me repeat: rafters have been crossing the tracks there for 40 years without a single accident, and now millions of dollars are potentially being lost to this rural seasonal economy because the company has decided not to create a safe crossing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806398">Last summer, two companies began helicoptering people across this newly closed access, adding hundreds of dollars to the cost of family rafting vacations. There was nothing that the federal government or provincial government could do about that, until now. Bill <Document DbId="8588471" Type="4">C-322</Document> would allow the minister to order CP and other railways to create safe crossings in special situations like this. If rail companies are concerned about safety, the solution is not to ban crossings but rather to make them safe.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="45">(1145)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4806399">Now, one may wonder why CP would not create a safe crossing to allow access to the Kicking Horse River. Initially it said it would—but only if the federal or provincial government paid for it. That is right. This company, which earned over $6 billion in 2014 and made a profit of almost $540 million in the first quarter of 2016, said the taxpayers should be on the hook for it to build a crossing over its own tracks. This is unacceptable, and it is worrisome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806400">Level crossings must be built in strategic locations so that pedestrians, cyclists, and even whitewater rafters can move around safely. The improvement of active transportation and the mobility of people are important priorities across Canada. It should be a no-brainer for every member of the House to support this legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806401">Unfortunately, the government is hiding behind obsolete regulations that prevent the minister from ordering the construction of new crossings, while he already has the power to order them closed. The government seems to be unwilling to take on the responsibility to give Canadians freedom of movement, to save Canadian lives, to force some companies to act in a way that favours small communities, to provide safe access to Canada's rivers and lakes across railroad tracks, which surely should be a fundamental right for every Canadian. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806402">I do not want to encourage anyone to illegally cross railway tracks. That is what government inaction would have people do. We want to make sure such crossings are legal and safe where they are needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806403">Across Canada, unregulated crossings cause twice as many accidents and fatalities as regulated crossings, and in some places hundreds of people cross railway tracks every morning. Of course, decades ago, kids in Saskatchewan would walk the railroad tracks to get to school. That may happen to some degree today as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806404">By one count, on May 15, 2012, between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., 289 pedestrians and 81 cyclists crossed the railway right-of-way in Mile End between Saint-Dominique and Henri-Julien streets in Montreal. Every one of these Canadians could have been fined a minimum of $287 under the Railway Safety Act. Under current laws, these were trespassers, and what they were doing is dangerous. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806405">The lack of safe crossings jeopardizes public safety and causes mobility issues in our communities. New Democrats have introduced this bill because we want to improve security for all Canadians, whether they are walking, cycling, driving, whitewater rafting, or just trying to access rivers and lakes near their homes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806406">Who else is supporting this legislation? There have been a number of groups, of course. They include whitewater rafters in British Columbia, the Greater Victoria Cycling Coalition, BC Healthy Living Alliance, Saskatoon Cycles, Canada Bikes, Citizens for Safe Cycling, Walk Toronto, Cycle Toronto, Ontario By Bike, Jane's Walk, Vélo Québec, Piétons Québec, the Outremont Pedestrians and Cyclists Association, and a variety of municipalities, cities, and businesses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806407"> I invite members to join me in supporting this legislation, which simply gives the transport minister powers to create safe crossings where they do not already exist. It is in the interest of communities, in the interest of Canadians, and in the interest of safety.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4806408">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to be here today to speak to issues surrounding Bill <Document DbId="8588471" Type="4">C-322</Document>, an act to amend the Railway Safety Act in relation to road crossings. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806409">While the government recognizes the complexity of railways and municipalities having to coexist, I would like to explain why the government cannot support the bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806410">Essentially, the bill would introduce inconsistencies into the Railway Safety Act, which is the subject of a comprehensive statutory review that has been moved up to start in 2017 rather than 2018. This was announced on November 3, 2016, by the <Affiliation DbId="214333" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation>. It will provide an opportunity for our government and parliamentarians to consider rail safety in a more comprehensive way than through private members' bills designed to address one-off situations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806411">This is very significant. I have the experience in my riding of Nickel Belt. It is very important that these issues related to rail safety be addressed in partnership with communities and all levels of government. Together we have the responsibility to improve rail safety across Canada, and this private member's bill seeks to address only one specific situation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806412">As members of Parliament, we all need to provide leadership in our communities to gather all levels of government to improve rail safety. Round table discussions with various communities—federal, provincial, municipal, and indigenous communities, the private sector, and Transport Canada—are crucial. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806413">The statutory review of the Railway Safety Act that has been moved up by a year to 2017 is a move in the right direction. </ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="4806414">First, in addition to a rigorous and robust rail safety regulatory framework, there are well-established, existing measures and processes in place, which ultimately makes the proposed bill redundant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806415">I will illustrate this redundancy by detailing the existing process for the central issue of the private member’s bill: opening or constructing new grade crossings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806416">To begin, the Grade Crossings Regulations clearly define the responsibilities of the railway company and the road authority with respect to grade crossings. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="4806417">Understandably, with approximately 14,000 public grade crossings along more than 48,000 kilometres of federally regulated railway tracks across Canada, the regulations recognize and entrench the shared responsibility for rail crossings. Railway companies, road authorities, municipalities and band councils in provinces, and private crossing owners are each responsible for managing safety at grade crossings. This is why Transport Canada encourages rail companies and communities to consult with each other to seek solutions through collaborative approaches.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="4806418"> Likewise, the existing process under the Canada Transportation Act encourages road authorities and railway companies to work together to agree whether or not to open a road crossing, where to open a crossing, and how to apportion the costs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806419">When the railway company and the municipality agree, the agreement may be filed with the Canadian Transportation Agency, which is an independent, quasi-judicial tribunal that makes decisions on a wide range of matters involving federally-regulated modes of transportation, including rail.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="4806420">These agreements usually include rates to be charged for work performed and specify which parties are responsible for paying for the work, as well as maintenance and liability. The filed agreement becomes an order of the agency authorizing the parties to construct or maintain the crossings, or to apportion the costs, as provided for in the agreement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806421">If a rail company and a road authority agree on a grade crossing but disagree on who should pay for the work, either party can ask the Canadian Transportation Agency to apportion the costs of that project. When an agreement cannot be reached, the parties have access to mediation services through the Canadian Transportation Agency. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806422">In most cases, the agency first tries to resolve first complaints through facilitation or mediation. Mediators assist the parties in negotiating a mutually satisfactory settlement among themselves. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806423">When mediation is unsuccessful, the next step is for one of the parties to approach the agency in question. Adjudication can take up to 120 days, depending upon the complexity of the case. The agency's ruling under adjudication is legally binding and can include where crossings should be located, how many are required, conditions that the crossing must meet, and apportionment of the costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806424"> Whether through mediation or adjudication, when crossings are required, Transport Canada provides safety-related advice to agencies before making its decision. All new crossings authorized by the agency must comply with the safety requirements of the Railway Safety Act and associated regulations, such as the Grade Crossings Regulations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806425">Under the act, the proponent for a new grade crossing must give 60 days' notice to other parties involved. When all other avenues have been exhausted and where there are exceptional threats to safety, the <Affiliation DbId="214333" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> already has the authority under section 32.01 of the Railway Safety Act to order a company, road authority, or municipality to, among other things, take corrective measures to address a threat to safe railway operations, including construction of a road crossing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806426">As members can understand, the process in place is a rigorous one even before construction of a grade crossing begins. It goes without saying that the next steps in this process are just as rigorous. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806427">The grade crossings standards referenced in the Grade Crossings Regulations set out the safety criteria for the construction, alteration, maintenance, inspection, and testing of grade crossings. These standards uphold safety at federally regulated crossings by promoting consistency and bring all federally regulated crossings in Canada under one common standard. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806428">Transport Canada's role includes monitoring railway companies through audits and inspections to verify that they meet safety standards under the Grade Crossings Regulations. To do so, the department conducts regular monitoring of rail works and operations, informs railways and road authorities of any safety deficiencies, and, if required, takes appropriate action. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806429">In addition, as previously noted, the Railway Safety Act was amended in June 2015 to provide broader ministerial authorities to address safety risks, threats, or concerns. If the minister considers them necessary in the interests of safe railway operations, specific measures may be ordered, such as constructing, altering, operating, or maintaining a railway work, and a crossing would be included.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806430"> While the impetus for Bill <Document DbId="8588471" Type="4">C-322</Document> to make it safer for pedestrians and cyclists to cross railway tracks is certainly worthwhile, road crossing issues are complex and multi-jurisdictional, requiring the involvement and co-operation of multiple players: the federal government, rail companies, road authorities, municipalities, and members of the general public. The relationship between Transport Canada and the Canadian Transportation Agency strikes the required fine balance between road safety and the needs of the communities. Ultimately, the government is confident that the regulations and processes in place have the necessary rigour and flexibility to address the interests of this proposed bill.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4806433">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join with my friend and colleague, the deputy critic for transport, to discuss Bill <Document DbId="8588471" Type="4">C-322</Document>, an act to amend the Railway Safety Act with regard to road crossings. If passed, this legislation would give the <Affiliation DbId="214333" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> the power to order the owner of a rail line to build a grade-level crossing across the track and to authorize the payment of a grant for that purpose.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806434">My understanding is that this legislation is principally designed to address a challenging circumstance in the sponsor's riding, where, according to the sponsor, there are not enough rail crossings, and therefore pedestrians are crossing the rail track at multiple uncontrolled locations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806435">As the issue at hand is a lack of pedestrian crossings along the Canadian Pacific Railway Outremont spur, and as it is common practice by the current Liberal government, one wonders why the <Affiliation DbId="214333" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> has not called his former caucus colleague, who happens to be the mayor of Montreal, to come up with a suitable plan to build grade-separated overpasses and underpasses for pedestrians to cross the track. However, as per another common practice by the government, it is easier to declare that rail safety for the middle class is a priority for the current minister than to do something about it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806436">It need not be said that rail safety is a priority for all Canadians, regardless of their personal financial circumstances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806437">While the intent of Bill <Document DbId="8588471" Type="4">C-322</Document> is to address a local issue, it will be national in its scope and should be judged on that basis. Federal legislation already provides municipalities and local authorities with the ability to get a railroad to the table to get a crossing built. Section 101 of the Canada Transportation Act states that if a municipality or the relevant local authority and a railway are unsuccessful in negotiating an agreement to build a crossing, the Canada Transport Agency may, first, authorize the construction of that crossing; second, determine what percentage of the construction costs each party will be responsible for; and finally, determine who will maintain the crossing. This current process puts the onus on each individual local authority to determine whether a new railway crossing is required; where the crossing can and should be built, taking into consideration its development plans; and how much they are willing to contribute financially to see that crossing built.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806438">Municipalities have the primary responsibility for their infrastructure, so it makes sense for them to be the ones determining if and where a railway crossing should be built. It should not be up to the <Affiliation DbId="214333" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> to determine whether a crossing must be built; it is up to the local government to determine whether it would like to see the rail crossing built. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806439">While Transport Canada does have the ability to close a crossing if it is considered unsafe, this power exists in the interests of safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806440">When people cross the track at an uncontrolled location, they are in effect trespassing on private property. The sponsor of this bill in effect is saying that because people are trespassing and putting themselves at risk, the minister needs to build more level-grade crossings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806441">To be clear, if pedestrians would use existing crossings instead of trespassing on busy railway spurs, the safety of the tracks would not be compromised in this respect. As cities grow around historic railway-owned rights-of-way, the kind of situation we are seeing in Montreal, where there may not be enough grade-separated crossings, will only become more common. Unfortunately, and on too many occasions, pedestrians are cutting holes in fences and taking shortcuts to wherever they need to go rather than walking to existing crossings. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806442">In 2015, accidents between pedestrians and trains resulted in 31 fatalities. The dangers for pedestrians cutting across the track without knowledge of whether a train is coming are obvious, but they are not heeded enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806443">I consider it a heavy burden to place on rail operators to have to contend with trespassers as part of their job, when they are already operating heavy equipment under challenging circumstances. I believe that the mental welfare of train operators should be considered in this debate on how to handle the densification of areas around rail lines in cities.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="00">(1200)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4806444">My issue with the bill is that increasing the number of pedestrian crossings that are not grade separated will only increase the opportunities for trespassing on private lands. This will in turn increase the opportunities for pedestrians to find themselves in fatal accidents or to stumble and fall.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806445"> I will be opposing the bill, because it proposes the wrong solution to the problem in Montreal and other densely populated cities that have rail lines crossing through them. There will never be a crossing at every single location that is most convenient for all pedestrians. The issue here is that pedestrians are trespassing on private property, thus exposing themselves to major danger. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806446">Governments and railroads share a combined responsibility to ensure that pedestrians stay off the tracks to the greatest extent possible and to make that an ongoing priority in infrastructure initiatives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806447">I see that my time is coming to an end, so I will leave it there and resume the debate when the bill is next taken up.</ParaText>

There have been over 17 hours of debate on this legislation. When we look at the number of hours we have to debate important pieces of legislation, 17 hours is more than a reasonable amount of time.

Arthur Porter had access to all state secrets. Under Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> as now drafted, senators and members of Parliament would have even more restrictive access than a civilian who is the head of SIRC.

However, the problem here is that what they did, which was egregious, seems to have normalized a practice that should not be seen as normal at all. In the early part of the 20th century there was a 40-year period in which closure was used exactly seven times. I do appreciate that the Liberal government is using it less, but it should be using it far less so that we could go back not just to a bar set by what Harper did, but to a bar set by normal parliamentary practice when debates did not face so many time allocations.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4806520">The legislation that was sent to the standing committee has now been approved because of the important work the committee did. The government has a responsibility to Canadians and this is a first step and it is a substantial first step. There is a review mechanism in place so that we can revisit this legislation and ensure that we either have it right, that we need to go further, or pull back. Members of Parliament will have the opportunity to do that. </ParaText>

We need to understand that the government has a responsibility not only to have meaningful debate but also to advance legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806523">I look forward to working with the member. She raised this question when I spoke in the House on this legislation, and at that time I offered that I would welcome the opportunity to answer any questions or concerns that she has. </ParaText>

I am wondering if the minister could talk about the amendments that were accepted and the collaboration that did take place in committee with respect to this legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806526">I wonder if she could talk about how we work in committees to make sure that we fix legislation, improve legislation, and review legislation in a collaborative way and not simply pursue legislation as it is presented with no questions, no amendments, and no alterations as it moves forward. Perhaps she could also comment on how that differs from the previous government which never listened to committees whatsoever.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4806527">Madam Speaker, I appreciate that question because it is important to highlight the amendments that were accepted. The committee made substantial changes to improve the bill and I would agree that the committee's work did improve this legislation. During clause-by-clause study on Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document>, amendments were made, including some by the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806528">The Liberals amended the bill to broaden the committee's mandate in clause 8 and this was further amended by the NDP. It was agreed to by all parties and accepted. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806529">The chair's double vote was removed from clause 19, ensuring the chair would only cast a deciding vote in the event of a tie. The committee advanced that amendment and the government accepted it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806530">Clause 21 was amended so that if anything is redacted from the committee's report, the revised version must be clearly identified as revised and must indicate the extent of the revision. The amendment was accepted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806531">A whistle-blower clause that would require the committee to inform the appropriate minister of any activity to discover that may not be conducted in compliance with the law was proposed by the NDP and was accepted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806532">Clause 14 and clause 16 in the original bill included seven automatic exemptions. The committee removed all of them. The government has reinstated those that are needed to protect individual privacy and rights, so the witness protection program and human intelligence sources for the government directly related to the ongoing investigations carried out by law enforcement agencies. The committee removed and the government has agreed to remove ongoing defence activities, the Investment Canada Act, and FINTRAC.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4806552">Madam Speaker, the New Democrats have moved forward a number of amendments. Concern has been expressed with regard to the idea behind Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> and the exemptions provided. Earlier today we heard the government House leader talk about the amendments that were accepted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806553"> It is important to recognize that when it comes to the whole idea of exemptions, Canada's legislation is very robust. In fact, to compare us with other countries of the Five Eyes, I would bring New Zealand's act to the attention of members. It allows the government to inform the committee that certain documents or information cannot be disclosed, because in the opinion of the chief executive of the relevant intelligence and security agency such documents contain sensitive information. This is the difference between exemption in New Zealand, which has had a system in place for years now, compared to what we are putting in place for the first time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806554">Would my colleague not agree that the legislation before us today is one of the most robust pieces of legislation to ensure Canada has one of the best parliamentary oversight committees in the world?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4806560">As a member of the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security, I had the privilege to closely examine the legislation over the course of eight meetings. I also want to note that the committee concurrently undertook a study on Canada's national security framework. Because a significant amount of the expert testimony we heard was so relevant and crossed over to both of those studies, the committee passed a motion to include all that was heard to be included in both studies and ultimately in both final reports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806561"> This is significant. I want to highlight the amount of work and effort that was done to examine the legislation, to hear from numerous expert witnesses, and to ensure the House was best positioned to pass the best possible legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806562">We heard from witnesses who came before the committee in Ottawa and as well from Canadians across our country during our cross country tour. We heard from experts in the morning sessions and we heard from the general public in the evening through public hearings in Vancouver, Calgary, Montreal, Toronto, and Halifax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806563"> We heard from academics, from experts working in the national security and intelligence fields, from Canada's Information and Privacy Commissioner, from Canada's national security agencies, from the existing oversight bodies, and from groups representing different religious and ethnic communities throughout Canada. The overwhelming testimony was conclusive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806564">Experts agreed that while Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> was a good start, it needed several amendments to make the proposed committee truly independent, accountable, and effective. Therefore, when it came time to propose amendments to the bill, most members of the committee listened to experts and attempted to ensure the independent national security and intelligence committee of parliamentarians would have the right tools to do what would be intended and what it would be required to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806565">Several amendments were proposed from committee members of all parties: the Liberals, Conservatives, and the NDP. While not all amendments were agreed to, several were.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806566"> The committee amended the legislation significantly to ensure the proposed oversight committee had subpoena powers for documents and witnesses, would be able to access all necessary information, would not grant the minister discretionary veto powers, and would be able to clearly identify whether the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had requested that a report be revised before submission to Parliament and, if so, why the Prime Minister had requested such revisions. We as the official opposition also attempted to ensure the proposed committee's composition would be non-partisan and that its chair and members would not be appointed by the Prime Minister. However, this amendment was rejected by the Liberals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806567"> All these amendments were aimed at making Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> more effective, more accountable, and more transparent to Canadians. However, the Liberal government had decided to reject the majority of the amendments that were adopted by the committee, therefore gutting Bill C-22, which took it back to its original form.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806568">The Liberals promised Canadians that national security oversight would be transparent and that it would be accountable. However, Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> in its current form proposes an oversight committee that has little review powers, that is not transparent, and is not accountable to Parliament. In short, the Liberals are proposing a committee that is an extension of the Prime Minister's Office.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4806570"> It has now been over a year since his appointment, and we are still debating the legislation. Well, we were debating it until the time allocation today. This is a key example of the Liberal government's unwillingness to be open to any changes or to strengthen the level of transparency and accountability. In spite of what the Liberals may say in this House and to Canadians, the Liberal government has decided to ignore the changes made by the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security, a committee made up of a majority of Liberal MPs I might add, and proceed with a version of the bill that very closely resembles the original one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806571">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> will still appoint the chair of the committee; the minister will still be able to decide what information the proposed committee receives and what it does not; and the committee will continue to have no powers to subpoena information or witnesses, even though this is a privilege currently enjoyed by other parliamentary committees. In short, the committee will continue to be controlled by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="214300" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation>. It will not be transparent, not be accountable, and it will not have the tools necessary to do its job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806572">Furthermore, the Liberal government does not want to discuss or have debate on this issue. Prior to my speech, the House voted on time allocation as put forward by the Liberals to shut down any and all debate on Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document>. This means that not only does the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> not want to have a national security oversight committee that is accountable to Canadians, that is transparent, and that is effective, but now he also wants to make sure that the House has as little time as possible to debate it. The Liberals are shutting down debate on this legislation because they decided over a year ago, when they appointed the chair, that they wanted this committee to be controlled by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="214300" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation>.We need to ensure that an appropriate structure and review process of our national security agencies is in place, and we also need to make sure that it is accountable to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806573">The public safety committee, including the five Liberal members, made significant changes to Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document>. We heard from experts and the general public. We did our job. However, these amendments were not what the Liberal government wanted, because it had already predetermined the outcome of what it wanted in the bill. It is not listening to experts, and it is not listening to the public safety and national security committee. It is insulting the parliamentary process and Canadians by extension.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806574">I urge my colleagues in this House to vote against the changes proposed by the Liberal government, which ignore expert testimony, ignore the committee, and gut the legislation. Independent oversight of Canada's national security agency is critical, and Canadians deserve better from the Liberal government.</ParaText>

There will be nine parliamentarians, which is an increase of nine from the number zero. Why do I say that?

There is nothing in the legislation to require that someone be appointed, for example, from the official opposition.

This is something that has been called for by parliamentarians, academics, other experts, commissions of inquiry, by the Auditor General, and many others, going back for more than a decade.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="4806588">The committee that will be created by this bill is key to our efforts in ensuring that our national security framework keeps us safe while protecting our rights and freedoms.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="4806589">When the initial version of this legislation was introduced last June, experts such as Professor Craig Forcese from the University of Ottawa noted that it would put in place “a stronger body than the UK and Australian equivalents”, and that it would be “a dramatic change for Canadian national security accountability”. Since then, the public safety standing committee of this House has studied the bill extensively and proposed a number of amendments. I thank the committee for its work and support many of its amendments to help ensure that the mandate, authorities, and access of the new national security and intelligence committee of parliamentarians will be extensive, effective, and appropriate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806590">Let me pause here to note that the title of this new entity is quite a mouthful, so during my remarks today, to save time, I may well use the acronym NSICOP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806591">With respect to the amendments that have been proposed by members of Parliament, the government has agreed to add a whistle-blower clause in clause 31 of the bill, requiring the committee to inform the appropriate minister, as well as the attorney general, if it uncovers any activity that may not be in compliance with the law. We also agree on a change that would restrict the chair of the committee to voting only in the event of a tie rather than having the chair vote as a matter of course. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806592">We agree on amendments that would deal with the NSICOP's annual reports. MPs on all sides of the House have concluded that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> should have the authority to redact certain sections of those annual reports if necessary, to safeguard vital national security interests or solicitor-client privilege. However, it would be mandatory for these reports to indicate the extent of and the reason for any such redactions. This is a reasonable and responsible approach, and I thank committee members for putting it forward. In essence, it mirrors the practice in the United Kingdom.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806593">We are also agreed on amendments to the section dealing with NSICOP's mandate. Accordingly, the authority of a minister to determine that an examination would be injurious to national security and therefore fall outside the mandate of the committee would apply only to ongoing operations. What is more, the minister would have to explain that determination to the committee, and would be bound to alert the committee as soon as the determination changes or as soon as the operation is no longer ongoing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806594">We are also supporting several big amendments to clause 14, which is the section that lists the type of information to which the NSICOP would not have access. We have removed from this exclusions list, information about ongoing defence intelligence activities supporting military operations, privileged information under the Investment Canada Act, and information collected by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada. All of these areas would have been excluded from NSICOP under the initial version of the bill. Those three blanket exclusions are now gone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806595">As we can see, the legislative process on Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> has been unfolding in a constructive manner. The government put forward a bill, the bill was studied in committee, amendments were proposed, and the government, after careful reflection, has agreed to accept a majority of what the standing committee requested. However, in all fairness and candour, there are also certain points on which we disagree with the committee, which is why the <Affiliation DbId="224669" Type="4">government House leader</Affiliation> introduced amendments at report stage on Bill C-22.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4806596">For one thing, the government sincerely believes that giving blanket access to information about the personal identity of human intelligence sources and people in witness protection, as well as ongoing police investigations, is wrong. It could put lives at risk. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806597">Certainly I do not expect parliamentarians to be indiscreet with this kind of information, but the risk grows each time we widen the circle of those who know the identity of a protected witness or intelligence source. The NSICOP is certainly able to do its job of scrutinizing the work of security and intelligence agencies without personally identifying individual protected witnesses or sources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806598">With respect to ongoing police investigations, I have two primary concerns. One is the simple importance of avoiding the perception of political interference in criminal investigations, which could appear from having politicians oversee police work in real time. The other is the potentially harmful impact of requiring law enforcement to divert resources from operations on the ground in order to keep parliamentarians apprised of their work while that work is actually happening. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806599">On this point, the CSIS director gave the standing committee the very good example of last year's police operation in Strathroy, Ontario, in which a possible terrorist attack was effectively thwarted. In that kind of fast-paced, resource-intensive situation, requiring resources to be assigned to send information to the committee of parliamentarians “would have been a distraction from the operation in progress” and could have constituted a public safety risk. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806600">We are also proposing to reinsert clause 16, which allows a minister to determine that certain information, narrowly defined, should be withheld from NSICOP on security grounds. I would point out that this is entirely in keeping with the way that these kinds of committees work in other countries, in the U.K., New Zealand, and Australia specifically. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806601">In the U.K., for example, a minister may prevent information from being shared with the committee on the grounds that it is too sensitive and should not be disclosed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806602">In New Zealand, a witness may decline to provide information on the grounds that it is sensitive and that disclosing it would not be in the national interest, and then it is up to the prime minister to overrule the witness and force disclosure. Incidentally, in New Zealand, it is the prime minister who chairs the committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806603">In Australia, ministers can issue certificates preventing witnesses from giving evidence to prevent disclosure of “operationally sensitive information”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806604"> Therefore, as members can see, clause 16, as we have proposed, is very consistent with the best practices of our allies. Their ability to share information with Canada could be jeopardized without clause 16.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806605"> However, in other ways the NSICOP to be created by Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> would go well beyond the scope that exists in other countries. The British committee requires a memorandum of understanding with the prime minister in order to examine anything beyond the work of three specific agencies: MI5, Ml6, and GCHQ. In Australia, the committee is limited to conducting statutory reviews of legislation and examining the administration and expenditures of particular agencies. A parliamentary resolution or ministerial referral is required for the Australian committee to even look at any other issues related to those agencies. The Canadian committee, by contrast, would be able to look at any activity carried out by any government department or agency that relates to national security and intelligence, and it would be able to follow the trail throughout the federal government. That is a far broader scope than exists in most other countries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806606">In other words, the national security and intelligence committee of parliamentarians created by Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> would have more access and more teeth than its counterparts elsewhere in the world. That was true even before the amendments made by the House standing committee, most of which the government is accepting, and it is certainly more true with those amendments now in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806607"> Finally, with the passage of Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> we will fix an anomaly in our security architecture and have a form of parliamentary scrutiny that this country deserves.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4806619">Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> is important, especially for the Liberals, considering it is central to the intellectual backflips they have been doing for three years now to justify their support for Bill <Document DbId="6842344" Type="3">C-51</Document>, passed in the last Parliament under the Stephen Harper government. The Liberal government has been in power for almost a year and a half now and we have barely completed this stage. It is worth mentioning, even if this is an issue for another debate on another day, that there is still no legislative measure on the table to right the wrongs created by Bill <Document DbId="6842344" Type="3">C-51</Document> regarding rights and freedoms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806620">That said, this is still a very important matter. Since Bill <Document DbId="6842344" Type="3">C-51</Document> was passed and, I would venture to say, even before, many commissions of inquiry have been formed after various incidents in connection with the work of national security agencies. There is one very clear finding: Canadians have lost a great deal of confidence in our national security agencies. This issue obviously affects our rights and freedoms, as well as our privacy, given the rapid advances in technology. However, this is also a matter of national security because, after all, if the public has no confidence in its agencies, it is difficult for them to do their work effectively and appropriately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806621">In principle, Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> is a good first step, and I can say that the minister is right about that. It is something that we should have had for a very long time. That said, very serious problems with the bill were raised in committee. A number of amendments would have gone a long way—even though they would not have made the bill perfect—to at least allowing parliamentarians to do their work better and to start off on the right foot.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806622">We can see that, and we have often heard the <Affiliation DbId="214300" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="224669" Type="4">Leader of the Government in the House of Commons</Affiliation> come back to one point. They say that this is new for Canada, that other countries have had more time to learn, and that we have to give ourselves some time. We are already some way ahead compared to other countries, but there is a problem. For example, look at how the chair of the committee is elected. In Great Britain, the committee chair is not only elected, but he is also an opposition member. As justification for not electing the committee chair, we are told that, in Great Britain, the committee has existed for a number of years now and that they decided to make changes only after a certain period of learning and becoming used to it. Here, clearly, as we have just heard, the minister is relying on a legislative review that will take place in five years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806623">However, why not apply now what we learned from our allies? Why relearn the lessons of the past? I have a theory, without wanting to spread conspiracy theories. When this nice job, which comes with a salary on top of an MP's salary, is announced a year in advance, it is difficult for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to break his promise to the Liberal member who had the good fortune to secure this great position. Therefore, I would say that this is why we were not listening to the opposition amendments or the testimony of the chair of the British committee who offered this extremely important point for the credibility of the committee. All the technical issues on the form could be addressed, but credibility is also very important, to get back to the point I made at the outset, which is the public trust in our national security agencies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806624">It is not just me saying this. I want to come back to the column in <I>The Globe and Mail</I>, co-written by professors Wesley Wark, Kent Roach and Craig Forcese, professors the minister likes to quote to talk about the importance of this first step that has been completed. In speaking of the amendments passed in committee, they said:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4806628">When we hear that and with the majority of the amendments having been thrown out and a time allocation motion having been thrown in to boot, it is difficult to see a path forward that would allow the committee to have that credibility and non-partisan environment it so desperately needs. The committee needs that not only to do its work, but also, as I said and it is worth repeating, in order to gain the public's trust so the public can begin trusting the work that is being done by the national security agencies. This is a key element and the government is clearly failing on that front.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="4806629">I want to come back to the two examples I mentioned in the questions I have asked the government since the debate began this morning, specifically regarding the time allocation motion and the bill itself. The issue of ongoing investigations has often been raised. That is one of the restrictions we tried to lift through our amendments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806630">Indeed, the two most striking examples of investigations into human rights violations that are worthy of examination by a body such as the one this bill proposes are the Air India inquiry and the Afghan detainees investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806631">These are still open investigations, so technically, they are still ongoing. Under this bill, however, the committee of parliamentarians will not have the authority or the power to gather intelligence or conduct investigations. Thus, various pieces of information revealed in the media recently and many questions raised in the House for many years now could never have been raised. That is problematic, because it undermines the committee's mandate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806632">Once again, this brings us to the public's confidence in the committee and its work, and by extension, in the work of our national security agencies. That is the theme of my speech, as members will soon see.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="4806633">When the government talks about some of the other issues that we raised in committee, it is important to note that for us, one point that has been clear is the restriction on access to information and the obvious solution is to limit it to cabinet confidence. With respect to everything else, we have to trust these parliamentarians, and the minister alluded to that issue. These parliamentarians will be sworn to secrecy and could potentially face jail time if any of this information is leaked. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806634">The government's approach seems to be one of not trusting the parliamentarians who will sit on this committee and who will literally never be able to talk about any national security issues in the public space. When the <Affiliation DbId="224672" Type="96">government House leader</Affiliation> or the <Affiliation DbId="214300" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> stand and tell us not to worry because the committee can use the bully pulpit if ever it feels it is unable to do its work behind closed doors, that is just not true. It is critical for Canadians to understand that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806635">Moreover, we talk about compromise and the importance of this being a non-partisan process. We hear the government say, “Well, the NDP proposed 13 amendments. The Liberals proposed 16. The Bloc proposed nine. The Green Party proposed two. We adopted two of those amendments so we are in the clear and everything is all right.” It is critical that the government look at the broader picture and the public trust.</ParaText>

While some choose to worship for spiritual reasons, others have fun, loudly, through music, song, and dance. On that day, they forget their worries and pursue forgiveness.

NWT has the highest rate of hepatitis C in Canada. About 250,000 people are infected with the virus in Canada, but most are unaware that they are infected. Many patients do not experience any symptoms until their liver becomes so damaged that they develop cirrhosis, liver cancer, or liver failure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806691">I encourage the development of a national hepatitis C strategy that includes voluntary testing for everyone born between 1945 and 1965, who make up the majority of cases in Canada, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Like many diseases, if caught early, there are much better outcomes for patients. If we work together, we can limit the impact of this virus and protect the health of all Canadians.</ParaText>

Important evidence, such as the effects of violence, pornography and the normalization of violence, the models of e-safety in Canada and elsewhere, as well as strong sentencing for perpetrators of sexual assault were things we did not find, which were needed for the recommendations. They were not sought, and we did not have enough information on those, so we have put that in this. </ParaText>

            <ResponseContent>
              <ParaText id="4806938">Mr. Speaker, with regard to (a), governments in Canada cannot address all of the country’s infrastructure needs alone. Low interest rates mean that governments have a unique opportunity to significantly enhance their investments in infrastructure. Additionally, there is opportunity to leverage investments in infrastructure by bringing private capital to multiply the level of investment. Large institutional investors, such as Canada’s public pension funds, have a large pool of capital that the Canada Infrastructure Bank, the CIB, can help attract and leverage to meet the country’s infrastructure requirements. The Canada Infrastructure Bank will work with provinces, territories, and municipalities to further the reach of government funding in infrastructure.  </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806939">With regard to (b), the CIB will be one tool in the Government of Canada’s long-term infrastructure plan to conclude and execute complex infrastructure deals using a wide breadth of financial instruments at its disposal, including loans, loan guarantees, and equity investments. The objective of the Canada Infrastructure Bank’s participation will be to structure its financial support in order to attract private sector capital and conclude project deals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806940">With regard to (c) and (d), the CIB will play a complementary role in developing innovative infrastructure financing specifically for projects that will have a revenue stream. Without the CIB, these projects may otherwise not be possible. As a result, the overall total investment in infrastructure can increase. 

</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806941">With regard to (f), the CIB will make investments in revenue-generating infrastructure projects and plans that contribute to the long-term sustainability of infrastructure across the country. It will be mandated to work with project sponsors to structure, negotiate, and deliver federal support for infrastructure projects with revenue-generating potential. The Government of Canada will leverage its investments in infrastructure by bringing in private capital to the table to multiply the level of investment. 

</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806942">With regard to (g) and (h), the CIB will be responsible for investing at least $35 billion on a cash basis from the federal government into large infrastructure projects that contribute to economic growth through loans, loan guarantees,  and equity investments. Part of this amount—$15 billion—will be sourced from the funding announced in the fall economic statement 2016. An additional $20 billion in capital will be available to the Canada Infrastructure Bank for investments that will result in the bank holding assets in the form of equity or debt. This $20 billion will therefore not result in a fiscal impact for the government.

</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806943">With regard to (e) and (i), additional details pertaining to how the CIB will operationalize its mandate are still under development and are not yet available. A fundamental principle in this structure will be to ensure taxpayers’ dollars are protected.
</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806944">Regarding the corporate structure of the Canada Infrastructure Bank, it will be accountable to and partner with government, but will operate at greater arm’s length than a department, working with provincial, territorial, municipal, Indigenous and investment partners to transform the way infrastructure is planned, funded, and delivered in Canada.

              <ParaText id="4806946">Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada’s top priorities are safety and security. Transport Canada’s primary mission is to serve the public interest by promoting a transportation system in Canada that is safe, secure, efficient, and environmentally responsible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806947">The minister does not approve projects. Rather he will, according to subsection 4.31(1) of the Aeronautics Act, make an order prohibiting the development or expansion of a given aerodrome or any change to the operation of a given aerodrome, if, in the minister’s opinion, the proposed development, expansion, or change is likely to adversely affect aviation safety or is not in the public interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806948">Transport Canada is aware of the concerns that can arise in relation to the development of new aerodromes across Canada, including the project that is currently being developed within the municipalities of Mascouche and Terrebonne.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806949">This is what notably motivated the Minister of Transport’s decision on March 4, 2016, to issue a ministerial order under the Aeronautics Act to prohibit the development of all new aerodromes in the cities of Mascouche and Terrebonne and to require the Corporation de l’aéroport de Mascouche, the Corporation,  to hold a full public consultation on the project. The Corporation complied with the requirements of the order and sent Transport Canada all of the comments and documents—including the ones from the Cities of Mascouche and Terrebonne—that were submitted as part of the formal consultation process. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806950">The department thoroughly examined all of the documentation and arguments submitted with regard to the project, both positive and negative, as well as the mitigation measures proposed by the Corporation, in order to address the population’s concerns. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806951">A number of factors were considered in the project’s overall evaluation, including compliance with regulatory requirements, aviation safety, the project’s economic impact, environmental protection, and public and private interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806952">The department conducted on-site verifications, reviewed the preliminary plans and the report on the public consultation held by the proponent, as well as the obstacles, all in accordance with TP312, Aerodrome Standards and Recommended Practices, and TP1247, Land Use in the Vicinity of Aerodromes in effect. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806953">This thorough review of the project allowed Transport Canada to ensure that flight operations will be conducted safely, while having a significant economic impact on the region. To illustrate this last point, the former Mascouche airport’s flying schools employed over 50 people and trained some 185 students in 2016. Over the past two years alone, Transport Canada has issued 116 private pilot licences and 63 commercial pilot licences to candidates from these schools. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806954">There are no public funds involved in this project. The department’s work related to the matter has not incurred any additional costs beyond those for regular operations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806955">It should be noted that part III of the Canadian Aviation Regulations, subpart 7(307), on consultations for aerodrome work, came into effect on January 1, 2017. Therefore, under these regulations, aerodrome proponents must now consult the interested parties and the communities before developing a new aerodrome or before making major physical changes to an existing aerodrome. No amendments to these regulations or to the department’s evaluation process are currently planned. </ParaText>

            <ResponseContent>
              <ParaText id="4806985"> Mr. Speaker, in processing parliamentary returns, the government applies the Privacy Act and respects the principles set out in the Access to Information Act. In responding to questions relating to the harmonized sales tax, HST, it also respects its commitments under the comprehensive integrated tax coordination agreements, CITCAs, with HST provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806986">With regard to the harmonized sales tax, it is a value-added sales tax imposed under federal legislation and administered by the Canada Revenue Agency, CRA, and the Canada Border Services Agency, CBSA. The tax has a federal portion that is equivalent to the goods and services tax, GST, with a rate of 5 percent, and a provincial portion, with a rate that varies by province. Currently, the combined federal-provincial rates are 13 percent in Ontario and 15 percent in Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island. The tax base of the HST, i.e., what is subject to the tax, is essentially that of the GST. The operation of the HST is governed by CITCAs between Canada and each HST province. Under the CITCAs, provinces are provided with certain flexibilities. Specifically, provinces are allowed to increase or decrease the rate of the provincial portion of the HST; provide provincial rebates to consumers at the point of sale, subject to an overall limit of 5 percent of the estimated GST base in a province and certain other conditions; set the rates applicable to the provincial component of the HST for rebates provided to public service bodies; and set the rate and thresholds of provincial new housing rebates, based on the general structure of the federal rebate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806987">Under the HST, businesses deal with only one tax administration and remit HST using the same return that they use for the GST. When filing their returns, businesses are not required to track the HST by the province in which transactions occur or to differentiate the provincial portion from the federal portion of the tax. All GST and HST is remitted as a single amount. In lieu of collecting such detailed information from businesses, the revenues attributable to the provincial portion of the HST are paid to provinces using a revenue-estimation formula known as the revenue allocation framework, RAF. That framework is set out in annex A of the CITCAs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806988">With regard to the revenue allocation framework, the RAF makes use of economic data from Statistics Canada and administrative data from the CRA and the CBSA to determine taxable consumption in Canada and the share of that consumption attributable to each participant in the RAF, i.e., the HST provinces and the federal government. More specifically, taxable consumption is estimated through five bases: consumer expenditure, approximately 63%; public sector bodies, approximately 12%; housing, approximately 17%; business, approximately 2%; and financial institutions, approximately 6%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806989">There are two fundamental components in the determination of the amount of sales tax revenue that each HST province will receive: the size of the GST/HST revenue pool and the provincial shares. The GST/HST revenue pool is the sum of all GST/HST assessed by the CRA and the CBSA nationally, net of input tax credits and applicable rebates. The provincial shares are determined by measuring the revenue potential of the total of the five bases in each jurisdiction, relative to the total revenue potential of the GST/HST.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806990">The GST/HST revenue pool is currently on the order of $71 billion per year.  </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4806991">With regard to the revenue estimation process, annual provincial revenue entitlements are the product of the assessed GST/HST, meaning the revenue pool, and each province’s share of the common tax base. Payments for a given entitlement year are first estimated in December prior to the start of the entitlement year. They are recalculated each December for five years, i.e., those five years are open. In the June that follows the fifth year, i.e., five and half years after the end of the calendar year in question, provincial payments are finalized and cannot be re-estimated. For example, in December 2016, the first estimate for 2017 was provided; in June of 2023, the final estimate for 2017 will be calculated and the year will close. Because revenue entitlements are estimated and since data comes in over several years, the amount of revenue to which an HST province is entitled for a particular year can change. As a result, a province may receive more revenue or may be required to repay revenue that it has already received, as revenue entitlements for open years are recalculated each December. In the event that a total repayment associated with prior years is greater than 7% of the estimated current entitlement, e.g., the 2017 entitlement year currently, provinces have the option of repaying the entire amount over three years.  </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4807053">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to once again rise in the House to discuss Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document>, an act to establish the national security and intelligence committee of parliamentarians and to make consequential amendments to certain acts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807054">We on this side of the House pride ourselves in avoiding easy absolutes and rejecting simple binaries and false dichotomies. The question before us today is not, as some would have us believe, whether we need to prioritize our security on the one hand, or our cherished values on the other hand. Rather, the question before us is quite simple: Is our national security regime working effectively and in a manner that is consistent with Canadian law and values?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807055">Simultaneously balancing these twin objectives, keeping Canadians safe while also respecting and safeguarding our rights and freedoms, are among the most fundamental duties that a government can perform. However, currently that duty does not contain an element of committee oversight, a glaring weakness which puts Canada at odds with accepted international best practices. To that end, in this legislation, we are confident that we have developed a model for robust and comprehensive parliamentary reviews, one that will help build the trust of Canadians in our national security and intelligence activities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807056">The establishment of the national security and intelligence committee represents the realization of a key 2015 campaign promise. However, I want to stress that it is by no means the only action we are taking to strengthen Canada's national security framework. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807057">First and foremost, we recognize that when it comes to an issue that is fundamental to who we are as a country, it is important that the will of Canadians is reflected as much as possible. As a result, our government has engaged in an unprecedented series of consultations with experts, stakeholders, parliamentarians of all parties, and individual Canadians on issues of national security and civil liberties. These consultations remain ongoing, and as such ensure that our approach to national security remains rooted in meaningful conversation and dialogue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807058">Second, our government remains committed to addressing the more problematic elements of Bill <Document DbId="6842344" Type="3">C-51</Document>, as introduced by the former government. Specifically, and largely as a result of the aforementioned public consultations, we remain committed to amending Bill C-51 so as to better protect the right to advocate and protest, and to better define rules regarding terrorist propaganda.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807059">Third, the ever-evolving nature of security threats, as well as the clear need to remain vigilant in defending civil liberties, require that any national security framework not be set in stone. As such, our government has committed to mandating statutory review of national security legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807060">Fourth, our government remains committed to fighting violent extremism in all forms. The recent rise in domestic hate speech and hate crimes, for example, has served as a poignant reminder of the need for vigilance and community outreach to combat domestic violence. The goal here is to coordinate the efforts being undertaken at multiple levels to further enhance our capacity to prevent radicalization and violence, and ultimately make Canada a global leader in this field.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807061">Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> fits within this pattern of strengthening and modernizing our national security laws and policies. As members have already heard, this bill would establish the national security and intelligence committee, a body comprised of parliamentarians from across parties, to scrutinize all of the national security and intelligence operations of the Government of Canada. Given that there are more than 20 departments and agencies within the Government of Canada that carry out national security-related functions, it cannot be overstated how important this initiative actually is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807062">The current system of security oversight, such as it currently exists, remains highly fragmented, with non-partisan review bodies, judicial oversight, and ministerial discretion all playing vital oversight roles. While these existing mechanisms will remain independent, untouched, and in place, the creation of a permanent committee will allow for a more comprehensive and reactive security oversight framework. As such, the committee's mandate will be necessarily wide ranging. It will look at not only the legislative, regulatory, administrative, and financial aspects of national security and intelligence, but also the operations and activities that departments and agencies of the federal government undertake in the name of national security.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="30">(1530)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4807063">To carry out this vital role, committee members would be given broad access to classified information with appropriate safeguards and exceptions, as well as leeway to examine matters they deem worthy of examination. Importantly, Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> would allow the committee to analyze and study laws, policies, and operations in real time, increasing the discipline, responsiveness, and accountability of our security framework. With the establishment of this committee, we would close what has amounted to an important accountability gap, one that has existed in Canada for far too long. It would also allow Canada to at long last count itself among its Five Eyes partners and other western countries that have long had parliamentary review of national security and intelligence activities. Clearly, this represents an extraordinary responsibility, and as a result would require checks and balances. I believe that the safeguards embedded in Bill C-22 strike this balance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807064">Furthermore, I believe that an already strong piece of legislation has been generally strengthened by the exemplary work done at the committee stage. It is important to reiterate that the government has accepted the vast majority of amendments put forward by the public safety committee. In particular, members will recall that the second reading version of the bill said that the new committee could not have access to information about ongoing defence intelligence activities, privileged information under the Investment Canada Act, and certain information collected by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada. The public safety committee, wisely in my opinion, recommended amendments giving the new committee access to this information. The bill is stronger as a result, and I would like to thank the committee members and expert witnesses for all their hard work. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807065">I also believe that this legislation has been strengthened by the additional report stage amendments introduced by the <Affiliation DbId="224669" Type="4">government House leader</Affiliation>. In particular, by further amending clause 14 of the bill, the government has reinstalled important safeguards designed to protect vulnerable intelligence sources and reduce the risk of political interference in security operations. Finally, the restoration of clause 16 of Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> would realign Canada's security framework with similar provisions in place among our Five Eyes allies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807066">Let me end my remarks by getting back to where I started. It is vital that this esteemed institution has a clearer view into the national security and intelligence functions of the federal government. By establishing the national security and intelligence committee of parliamentarians, we would finally open that window, and we would do it responsibly. This initiative would serve Canadians and our democracy well. I therefore call on all members for their support tonight.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807084">Once again, what we are seeing today is completely the opposite. Those are the very words of the minister who is sponsoring Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807085">Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> was introduced in the House of Commons last June 16, in order to establish the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians. Let us recall that the establishment of a parliamentary oversight committee was a promise made by the Liberals. Clearly, it is important to make sure that our national security bodies are properly examined. We must absolutely ensure that this committee has the tools it needs to do its work. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807086">However, we know that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has already appointed a member of his caucus, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214297" Type="2">Ottawa South</Affiliation>, as chair of that committee, even though the legislation has not yet passed. A gag was used today. A committee chair was appointed. There is no legislation in place, but we already know the name of the chair of a committee that does not exist.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807087">The government is breaking a well-established tradition of our parliamentary system by imposing a chair the way it did. Committee chairs have always been elected by the committees themselves, not imposed by the Prime Minister's Office. The Liberals promised Canadians during the election campaign that they would form a committee of parliamentarians on national security. They said, promised and repeated that this committee would be non-partisan. Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> does not create a committee of parliamentarians. It is not neutral nor is it non-partisan. It is controlled by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="214300" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807088">We have to realize that the Liberal government is much better at making speeches and symbolic gestures than it is at taking real action. However, in finest federal Liberal tradition, they promise one thing in a campaign and do the opposite once ensconced on the government benches. This is called being partisan. It reeks of partisanship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807089">Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> imposes many barriers on the committee's ability to access information or call witnesses. This, also, is unlike similar committees that operate effectively in allied countries, such as the United Kingdom. The official opposition presented motions to amend Bill C-22 to the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security in December.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807090">On the issue of a non-partisan committee, we would expect some of the opposition's recommendations to be accepted, but all of the official opposition's proposed amendments were rejected. We only wanted to ensure that the composition of the committee is not partisan and that its chair and its members are not appointed by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807091">Clearly, as we now know, that recommendation was not accepted. The committee should be established by Parliament and be accountable to Parliament, not just to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="214300" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation>. However, the Liberal government is not listening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807092">We also wanted to remove the many blocking mechanisms in Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> that limit the committee's access to information and power to call witnesses. Once again, the Liberal government has said no. We wanted to ensure the committee's annual reporting process to Parliament will be more transparent. The Liberal government has decided otherwise. This is what sunny ways look like. This government is becoming a master in the art breaking promises.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807093">The Liberals promised a modest deficit. If we were to give them a report card today, they would get a failing grade. The same goes for electoral reform. The <Affiliation DbId="214300" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> even talks about this in the fascinating piece I just read from. I quoted a few passages, but I will refrain from quoting it any further. I will have other opportunities to do so. The issue of electoral reform was a monumental failure, even though the Liberals spent hundreds of thousands of dollars consulting Canadians. They ignored the results of those consultations. They simply went ahead and did what they wanted anyway.</ParaText>

A piece of the answer that we have seen in other jurisdictions and that has been talked about in many of the recommendations I spoke to earlier is the need to have a parliamentary committee made up of members of the House that would be able to follow information no matter where it goes. There may be a single incident involving intelligence that moves from the RCMP to the Canada Border Services Agency and that is also involved with immigration and many other agencies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807125">This new committee would have the power to look into all corners of security and intelligence. From the government's perspective, it was incredibly important to bring it in early and set it up. I am very encouraged that the bill is before the House, and I am anxious for this new committee to get to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807126">Even before the committee saw this, experts rang in on the efficacy of what was proposed. Of course, we improved it, but it is a good idea to take a look at what some experts were saying about the state of the bill in its improvement, the leap forward that we made even prior to the amendments made at committee stage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807127">Craig Forcese, a professor of law at the University of Ottawa and a renowned expert in this area, said, “this will be a stronger body than the U.K. and Australian equivalents, and a dramatic change for Canadian national-security accountability”. He went on to call it “a good bill” and gave it “a high pass”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807128">His colleague Wesley Wark said, “I fully support Bill C-22”. He noted some improvements, but he basically issued a warning not to let perfect be the enemy of the good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807129">The Canadian Civil Liberties Association supported the bill, saying, “This new accountability mechanism is crucial”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807130">In the media, there were many positive comments. The <I>Toronto Star</I> said that this is “an important first step toward accountability” and that it “would provide an essential check” on the security establishment. That was before the committee made its recommendations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807131">In the Commonwealth, we have gone much further. This is particularly noteworthy given the fact that the testimony the committee heard from the United Kingdom, for example, was to go slowly at the beginning because the committee, as it establishes itself and its work, needs to earn the trust of both the Canadian public and the institutions it is reviewing.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4807132">Notwithstanding that, we thought we would start aggressively, start ahead of everyone else in the Commonwealth, because we recognize, particularly with the dearth of action over the last decade, that there is an imperative nature to get these oversight mechanisms that had been ignored in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807133">In the course of testimony, the committee did what it should do. It reviewed the material, heard from expert witnesses, and made a number of recommendations. The government was happy to get behind and support a number of those recommendations which are reflected in the bill that is before the House today. I will run through some of those quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807134">There is a whistle-blower clause requiring the committee to alert the appropriate minister and Attorney General if it uncovers something that may be illegal. There is a requirement that the annual report indicate where redactions have been made and why. The chair only votes to break ties; in other words, the chair does not have a double vote. It limits a minister's authority to determine that an examination would be injurious to national security and therefore outside the committee's mandate to ongoing operations, and requires the minister to alert the committee when the operation is no longer ongoing or when examining it would no longer pose a national security problem. Finally, it allows the committee access to information about ongoing defence intelligence activities in support of military operations, privileged information under the Investment Canada Act, and information collected by FINTRAC. That is all in the amendment to clause 14.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807135">It can be seen that a great number of recommendations that were made by the committee were accepted by the government and are reflected in the bill. I think they are important improvements. They certainly go well beyond the standard that we see in any other Commonwealth country. I will come to an examination of those in a minute, but let us take a look quickly at some of the clauses that were rejected. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807136">Reinserting in clause 14 giving information about human intelligence sources and witness protection was rejected, and I think for very sensible grounds. If somebody is in a witness protection program, as an example, we do not want to be sharing that name any more than is absolutely necessary. Even for the agencies that are sharing that information, not everybody in those agencies has access to it. We want to limit how much those names go out. That just makes prudent and good sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807137">There is also restriction around information on ongoing law enforcement investigations. This is to avoid perceptions of political interference in an ongoing criminal investigation. This does not mean after the investigation that they cannot look into what has transpired to ensure that everything was as it should be, but when that matter is ongoing and current, certainly there is cause for concern around whether or not that would constitute interference and whether or not police would have to divert resources, to pull it off a case in order to work with the committee, so retrospectively instead of while it is ongoing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807138">Briefly I want to talk about some of the differences, because they are important, about Canada and some of our Commonwealth comparators. If we look at Britain, for example, in order to look beyond MI6, MI5, or GCHC, a memorandum of understanding is actually required between the committee and the Prime Minister. In Australia there is a limit strictly to statutory reviews of legislation and administration and expenses of particular agencies. It would actually be a parliamentary resolution or a ministerial referral to look at any other issue. It would require that level of depth, but that is not the case here. There are no such restrictions. There is the ability for the committee to look in every corner. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807139">With respect to access to information, every single one of the Commonwealth partners, and I will not list them all but I can say the U.K., New Zealand, Australia and so forth, all put in restrictions around information sharing that deal with operational sensitivity and things that pose a threat to national security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807140">Much has been made of this, but the fact remains, obviously, that there needs to be the ability for the minister to protect national security when it is appropriate, and if there is a disagreement between the committee and the minister, then there is the ability for the committee to file a report of all the accumulated instances where they feel the government has not provided that information, and that could be aired publicly. Of course, that committee would have a very strong pulpit from which to speak.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807141">The bottom line is that the bill is the beginning, an incredibly important first step on a journey ensuring we have appropriate oversight for our security intelligence framework. I look forward to this bill passing and for the work to come that we committed to in the platform.</ParaText>

I certainly hope that his experience as parliamentary secretary for public safety will not be as frustrating as it was to be parliamentary secretary for democratic institutions. I highly doubt that the government plans to pull the plug on this legislation in the next 24 hours, so it is bound to be a bit more rewarding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807143">All levity aside, I support this bill. It is an important piece of legislation. It is absolutely the case that when Mr. Justice O'Connor and others testified in hearings on Bill <Document DbId="6842344" Type="3">C-51</Document> in the 41st Parliament, the failure of Canadian governments over time to have parliamentary oversight of security operations and security entities was drawn to our attention numerous times. He quoted Craig Forcese, who is one of Canada's leading experts, as is Kent Roach. They would prefer to see additional improvements to this bill, as would I, but I appreciate that important amendments were accepted at committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807144"> Would the parliamentary secretary be able to give us an update on what is being done to remedy the egregious multiple affronts to security and safety in Canada that came forward in Bill <Document DbId="6842344" Type="3">C-51</Document>? I opposed Bill C-51, not primarily because it offended Canadian civil liberties, although it does, but because it created silos in the views of people like Mr. Justice O'Connor, where CSIS would have information and have no obligation to share it with the RCMP and no obligation to share it with CSEC. Really, Bill C-51 makes us less safe, and the faster we can get rid of all of its various elements, potentially other than part 2, the better off we will all be.</ParaText>

It is important to note that there would be a five-year mandatory review. While we are ahead of the Commonwealth and while we think, after the committee's recommendations and the listening that we did across the country, that we have a very good bill, there is a mandatory review process to make sure we could look at how effective this committee is being and how we could improve it. We do not hold this out as perfection, but we do feel that this is the right place to start.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807146">On the issue of changes and when we can expect them, the committee at this very moment is considering a report on the security and intelligence framework. We want to hear from that committee. It has done incredibly important work. It has heard from witnesses across the country. That committee report is going to be a very important input into the minister's overall process on responding. We have very clear platform commitments on what we feel needs to be changed and improved to get right that simultaneous work that needs to be done to protect Canadians and also to ensure that their rights are also protected. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807153">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to rise today in support of Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document>, an act to establish a national security and intelligence committee of parliamentarians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807154"> After second reading consideration and committee scrutiny, we now have the opportunity to review the bill at report stage. The robust parliamentarian process has served us well. The bill has been carefully studied by members on all sides of the House. Advice has been heard from expert witnesses and the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security has proposed amendments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807155">As the legislation stands today, it will move our country toward a more accountable and effective national security system. As many have said today and prior to today, the legislation is long overdue. We have heard stakeholders call it “crucial” and affirm that it will establish a committee in Canada that is stronger than its international counterparts. It will fill a significant gap that has existed in Canada for far too long. It will enable us to achieve our twin objectives of ensuring that our national security agencies are working effectively to keep Canadians safe and that the rights and freedoms of Canadians are protected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807156">Creating a new national security and intelligence committee of parliamentarians honours a major commitment of the government to Canadians. The committee will be an enormously important addition to our parliamentary landscape. It will have: extraordinary access to classified information in order to closely examine intelligence and security operations; enhanced scrutiny of national security and intelligence activities; a broader mandate than counterparts in other modern democracies; the ability to set its own agenda fully independent of government; the responsibility to report annually to Canadians through Parliament; and the power to examine activities government-wide, including ongoing operations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807157">As the legislation stands now, the committee will meet the dual objectives we set long ago, which is to ensure our national security apparatus is working to keep Canadians safe and secure, while protecting the rights and freedoms of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807158"> When the bill was first introduced, it proposed a stronger committee than those that existed with many of our international allies. With amendments, the scope, authorities, and access we are proposing for the committee will be broadened even further. The government has indicated that it will accept most of these amendments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807159">With respect to scope, for example, we agreed with the committee that the committee must be empowered to review national security and intelligence operations. As amended, that will include the operation of crown corporations. Further, as amended, if the minister determines that the examination will be against national security, his or her power to delay it will be limited to the period of time during which the operation is under way. Afterward, the committee can review the operation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807160">Another important amendment is whistle-blower protection that will require the committee to inform a minister and the attorney general about any national security or intelligence activity undertaken by a department that may not comply with the law. Like my colleagues, I was pleased that this amendment was widely endorsed. I also agree that the chair of the committee should be given a vote only in the case of a tie. I also agree with many of the changes regarding access to information exemptions for the bill initially proposed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807161">With the recent amendments, for example, the committee will now be able to receive information about ongoing defence intelligence activities that support military operations. It will also have access to relevant information collected by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada and to privileged information under the Investment Canada Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807162"> The government has also agreed to amend the legislation so that reasons must be given for any redaction. Indeed, the government has been open to reasonable amendments throughout the parliamentary process. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807163">We have not only conducted a careful examination of this crucial legislation, but we have also benefited from many years of consideration in creating this committee and from long collaboration with our international partners. Every other member of the Five Eyes alliance, including Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, has a legislative body with access to classified information to oversee security and intelligence matters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807164">Canada has tried to create a committee for over a decade now. It is time we give Canadians and parliamentarians the mandate to review these activities that we all want and need. Today, we are all taking one step closer to bringing this important new body into existence. We are closer to a system in which parliamentarians are better able to hold the government to account. We are closer to ensuring that concrete actions are taken when deficiencies and problems with our security framework and operations are identified.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807165">Having learned from some of the best practices of our allies, we are closer to a truly developing a Canadian approach to national security accountability.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4807182">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to join this very important debate about the structures we have in place for oversight of our intelligence and law enforcement activities. Unfortunately, we are doing so again under the gun of closure. This is at a time when the government is contemplating changes to our parliamentary rules that it would like to move forward without even working with other parties. It would in effect make closure automatic on bills that it brings forward. This is some of the context in which we see a limiting of discussion here today. At the same time, this is an important discussion that I am very glad to be able to participate in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807183">In general, when we think about the oversight mechanisms that exist for our intelligence agencies, we can have expert oversight, oversight by externally appointed experts who have specific knowledge in this area, and parliamentary oversight, which is oversight by elected officials. There are pros and cons to both of these options, and certainly they can exist in tandem with one another.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807184">For a long time in Canada, we have had a strong system of expert oversight. What the government is doing with the legislation is bringing in something that Liberals are calling parliamentary oversight. However, in effect, and I will get into the details, this is not meaningful parliamentary oversight. It does not achieve many of the advantages of expert oversight, but it also does not achieve the advantages that might be associated with a more genuine parliamentary oversight model. This is the objection that I have to the legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807185">If we were going to bring in a more genuine parliamentary oversight structure similar to some of the private members' bills that Liberal MPs, such as the member for <Affiliation DbId="213979" Type="2">Malpeque</Affiliation>, have at different times proposed, we would find our caucus more sympathetic to those kinds of arguments. However, we are seeing something that does not at all capitalize on those advantages, because it leaves control in the hands of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. At the same time, it does not entail some of the advantages that exist in the structure of an executive oversight system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807186">Would it not be perverse if in a bill that was supposed to be about strengthening Parliament, we actually saw a bill that created all the tools for strengthening and deepening the grasp of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> over the direction of Parliament? That is exactly what we see here. It is legislation that tightens the control and the power of the Prime Minister's Office, nominally about parliamentary oversight, but that actually has many of the opposite effects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807187">Let us review what was committed to by the party in government. The Liberals' election commitment was, “We will create an all-party committee to monitor and oversee the operations of every government department and agency with national security responsibilities.” What we had in this election commitment was the implication of all-party inclusion, meaningful review of past operations, and oversight of present operations. It would be ongoing oversight as well as a review of past operations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807188">What we have, though, is nothing in the legislation to guarantee that all parties would be represented, because we do not have a committee that takes on the traditional form of a parliamentary committee. The way our committees normally function is that the leaders of parties nominate members of their parties to be members of those committees, and the committee is laid out in proportion to representation in the House. Since we are talking about a joint committee, it is probably in proportion to representation in this and the other place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807189">In fact what we have is the government creating a committee where the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> gets to choose all of the members. Yes, it says that only a certain number can be members of the government, but it does not prescribe the distribution of opposition members. It does not say that the distribution should be reflective of the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807190">It is conceivable that the government could appoint independents who have recently departed from the Liberal caucus to this committee. I do not know how likely that is, but there are no protections in the legislation to ensure there is meaningful representation of all party perspectives. Even when members of opposition parties are appointed, again, those appointments are fundamentally at the pleasure of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who designates the chair. In fact, long before this legislation has been passed, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1"> Prime Minister </Affiliation> had already publicly designated the person he is going to select as chair, which I think shows a great lack of respect for this institution.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4807191">In terms of the appointment process, in terms of the distribution process, in terms of the lack of formal consultation requirement for the Senate or any clear definition of what consultation with other parties would look like in the process of those appointments, we see legislation that is about strengthening the power of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1"> Prime Minister </Affiliation> over the process of intelligence review. That is not at all in keeping with what many would have thought was the spirit of that Liberal election commitment. It is, in many ways, moving in the opposite direction of what it purports to be doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807192">There are not only limitations that ensure the control of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1"> Prime Minister </Affiliation> in the process of appointing members of the committee, but there are also significant problems with the way in which the information is handled. Ministers, as per one of the amendments that is going to be reintroduced, as well as the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1"> Prime Minister</Affiliation>, can choose to exclude certain information on a variety of different bases. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807193">What jumped out at me when I read the legislation initially, and members can look at it, is subclause 21(5), which states:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807194">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">If, after consulting the Chair of the Committee, the Prime Minister is of the opinion that information in an annual or special report is information the disclosure of which would be injurious to national security, national defence or international relations or is information that is protected by litigation privilege or solicitor-client privilege or, in civil law, by immunity from disclosure or the professional secrecy of advocates and notaries, the Prime Minister may direct the Committee to submit to the Prime Minister a revised version of the annual or special report that does not contain that information.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807195">In principle, I think members would be supportive of the idea that information which would be injurious for national security should be excluded from public release. However, when the section is so general as to include the possible exclusion for information that would be injurious to international relations, I would submit that almost anything that would come out of this committee could potentially be injurious to international relations. However, the adjudication of that process is not independent. It is not subject to the knowledge and expertise of the committee. It is simply up to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1"> Prime Minister </Affiliation>. If he says he does not want that section included because it could be injurious to international relations, perhaps this might be more an issue of “injurious to the reputation of the government”, and that would be a motivating basis for excluding that information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807196">I posed this question to the <Affiliation DbId="224669" Type="4">House leader</Affiliation> when we initially debated the bill at second reading. The House leader asserted at the time that the committee report would be provided to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1"> Prime Minister </Affiliation> for the sole purpose of ensuring that it does not contain classified information. In reality, though, the subclause is very clear, in black and white, that it allows exclusions on the basis of international relations as well as a range of other criteria, and that the determination of what would be included and excluded is solely at the discretion of the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807197">We had a concern raised today about disclosing certain information to the committee. It was raised by the <Affiliation DbId="214300" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation>, who effectively said that there is more risk of this information leaking out if more people have access to this information, and that is why certain information should be excluded from being shown to the committee. At the same time as saying that, there is nothing in this legislation that requires the individuals appointed to the committee, or even the individual who is appointed chair, to have experience handling and dealing with classified information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807198">This comes back to the central point, which is that we have a choice between expert oversight or parliamentary oversight, or some combination thereof. However, effectively this bill would not provide the advantages of either. It would not require that those appointed to the committee have some experience with the handling of classified information, which would build some expertise and experience into the question of the handling of that classified information. It would not give the committee the level of independence that it should have by leaving aspects of the appointments as well as the management of information to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1"> Prime Minister</Affiliation>. Effectively, it would tighten the control of the Prime Minister's Office over what really should be a parliamentary function.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4807199">It is for these reasons that I will be disagreeing with the government on amendments coming forward, and likely, unless we see what we want in the amendments, voting against the bill.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807200">Mr. Speaker, I have found that the Conservatives are trying to find a reason to justify their vote on this particular piece of legislation. It really does not make much sense when we listen to one member versus another member. At the core, the Conservatives appear to be in opposition of having a parliamentary oversight committee. I think the Canadian public would be best served if the Conservatives would be straightforward as to whether they support a parliamentary oversight committee today, because we know that yesterday they did not. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807201">The second issue that I take some exception with is that the member makes reference to the fact that we could be doing more. He used the example of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> making appointments. In New Zealand, which is one of the Five Eyes countries, the prime minister is actually on the committee. If we look at the committee that we are talking about today in this legislation, the number of Liberal MPs that would sit on the committee would be a minority of the overall membership of the committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807202">Therefore, I ask the member this. Do the Conservatives support parliamentary oversight today? Also, what other amendments would they like to see that would make it more robust?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807203">Mr. Speaker, I am happy to go through the points that the member made. He said that it was about the overall principle of parliamentary oversight. We are at report stage. We are not just talking about the principle of the bill, we have to get into the details. I think it is important for members to analyze, think about, and understand some of the problems with the details. It is not good enough that in principle the government has said that it wants to move in a certain direction, because, as I have argued, the details point in a very different direction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807204">With respect to parliamentary oversight, as I said clearly during my speech, I see advantages to the expert oversight model and advantages to the parliamentary oversight model. However, the legislation we have in front of us does not create a genuine system of parliamentary oversight because the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> still holds all the cards. We are not talking about a parliamentary committee, we are talking about a committee of parliamentarians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807205">On the member's point about Liberal MPs forming a minority, I think that is clear sleight of hand, because the government appoints all the members and it gets to appoint some senators. Therefore, if it appoints quasi-independent senators, who we all know are perhaps not as independent as the claim might be, we are obviously still in a position of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> holding the cards. If there were advice sought from the Senate about how to appoint if Senate caucuses had input, if Senate appointments were reflective of the distribution of the Senate, then we would not have that problem. However, this is not a typically structured joint committee of the two Houses. It is a committee of parliamentarians chosen entirely by the Prime Minister and serving at the pleasure of the Prime Minister. I think we need to dig into those details and discuss those details.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807206">In terms of amendments, we have amendments coming forward tonight. I think some of the amendments that we are proposing are very good, and some of the government House leader's amendments are not so good. Therefore, if the member wants to know what we are proposing, I would encourage him to vote with us this evening.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4807211">Mr. Speaker, as I have outlined, we have concerns about the legislative framework that has been set up here. It does not provide the committee with the effective tools to do its job, and that comes in many different forms. I have spoken principally about this issue of the independence of the committee and the control the Prime Minister would have over the flow of information in and out, as well as who sits on the committee. It may well be sensible and there may well be an argument for excluding certain information from the purview of the committee, but for all of the power in terms of the control of that flow of information to be in the hands of the government does not create the kind of independence one would expect to see in oversight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807212">Again, if there are concerns about information leaking out, we have made the suggestion that we have an expectation that those on the committee would have experience in handling classified information, but that was not a suggestion that was accepted by the government. We have a number of these problems because the government is unwilling to accept the constructive feedback we have provided. It speaks to the underlying reality that the government does not want to hand over control. It just wants to make it look like it is. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807213">Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to speak to Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document>, which is legislation that would establish a committee of parliamentarians to review our national security and intelligence activities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807214">This bill engages two areas of extraordinary importance to all Canadians: freedom and security. My constituents in Mississauga East—Cooksville, like all Canadians, are vitally concerned about their liberties and freedoms. They are also very conscious of the need for their security and the security of their fellow Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807215">The debate in these areas is often set out in terms of a zero-sum game. Supposedly, increasing security means less freedom, or that as security decreases, freedom increases. Simply put, this is not true. While on some few occasions a trade-off or balance may be necessary, in reality, most of the time, freedom and security are entirely complementary ideals. There is no real long-term freedom without security. There is no real stable security without freedom. Freedom without security is a charade. Such freedom in a security vacuum is an empty concept. It is life inside a compound or a gated community living in constant fear. Likewise, security without freedom is life in a real or virtual prison cell. This is one of the reasons that I support this bill. It advances the mutually reinforcing goals of liberty and safety. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807216">The need for review in the areas of national security and intelligence is now broadly recognized. Sadly, one can see many examples of failures to provide security and failure to protect liberties both abroad and in Canada. Such reviews involving classified information are particularly challenging. The U.S. 9/11 Commission found, “Secrecy stifles oversight, accountability, and information sharing”. Challenging or not, effective reviews must be done. Literally, it is a matter of life and death. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807217">Accepting the need for such reviews, the real and productive debate is about the appropriate mechanisms for review. When we consider the appropriate mechanisms, we must recognize that this is a marked departure from our parliamentary system of government. National security and intelligence have traditionally been the exclusive preserve of the executive branch. A review system that works within our parliamentary form of government is required. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807218">The first matter in this regard that one must consider is the very real problem of who is best placed to oversee these intelligence and security matters. It is the classic dilemma of who watches the watchers. Should the reviewers be experts? They have the experience and knowledge in such matters. Should the reviewers be independent outsiders, like parliamentarians? There are arguments supporting both positions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807219">Certainly, experts are used in Canada's other review bodies, being the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the RCMP, the Communications Security Establishment commissioner, and the Security Intelligence Review Committee. Parliamentarians are obviously independent. They do not necessarily start with the required expertise. However, if one uses experts, particularly in this somewhat closed subject area, one tends to get those who, through long association, might be considered too close to the agencies under review. This closeness can develop in complete good faith and despite genuine efforts to resist it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807220">I believe it is right to use parliamentarians in this regard. As to their lack of expertise, members of Parliament are expected to act in many areas outside their common knowledge base. They deal with economics in their consideration of budgets and other financial legislation. They deal with health policy in legislation. They deal with moral issues in matters like the assisted dying law. They deal with scientific policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807221"> Parliamentary oversight of security and intelligence matters is based upon the very foundations of representational democracy. Our whole democratic system assumes a faith in the people's representatives' abilities. However, many parliamentarians will start their duties in this regard without any background knowledge. This makes the support of the secretariat set out in clauses 24 and 25 essential. It is critical that non-expert parliamentarians be supported by staff with the necessary long-term expertise and corporate memory.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4807222"> I further note with approval that the secretariat could contract for independent legal advice. This is not restricted to the Department of Justice for legal advice. While that advice is admirably professional, the Department of Justice advises virtually all other actors in these areas simultaneously. Independent legal advice can enhance the independence and thus the effectiveness of the secretariat. Effectively, parliamentary review and oversight simply will not work without secretariat assistance. Therefore, I urge the government to give the secretariat the necessary priority and resources. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807223">I note the review committee's mandate is not limited to simply protecting rights and ensuring legal compliance. The committee would be free to consider all matters, including those of effectiveness of subject organizations and even value for money, i.e., are we getting the security that we need commensurate with the resources we are expending. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807224">I strongly support the composition of the committee as set out in clause 5. It nicely balances the interests of all major parties within this House and within the Senate. The inclusion of senators would provide for the possibility of some beneficial continuity for the committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807225">This legislation in clause 8 would restrict the committee from reviewing ongoing matters if the relevant minister determines the review would be injurious to national security. This is an appropriate restriction recognizing the established responsibilities of the executive branch in our parliamentary form of democratic government. It is not hard to imagine the impracticalities and problems associated with such a review in the midst of an ongoing sensitive matter. The interference, distraction, and diversion of limited resources are only some of those potential problems. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807226">Some members might note that the provisions make clear that committee members must honour their commitment to confidentiality. These matters are dealt with in clauses 10 through 12. Sadly, parliamentarians have not been above the breach of these rules. In this regard, I remind the House that one of our colleagues, Fred Rose, a former member for Montreal—Cartier, was convicted in 1946 for conspiracy to pass on official secrets to a foreign power,<?bk?> i.e.,<?ek?> the Soviet Union. He was sentenced to six years in prison.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807227"> This legislation in clause 9 recognizes that there are other review bodies, albeit non-parliamentary, engaged in potentially related matters. Co-operation and de-conflicting are mandated and only sensible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807228"> This bill would provide the committee the broadest powers. Clause 13 says that the committee is “entitled to send for persons, papers and records, and to have access to any information”. Please note the words “any information”. The only information excluded is cabinet documents being confidences of the Queen's Privy Council. This slight restriction is entirely consistent with our parliamentary system of government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807229">We must recognize that this legislation is a novel approach for Canada. National security and intelligence have traditionally been matters strictly of the purview of the executive, of the cabinet. The proposed review committee would be the legislative branch's first foray into these two sensitive areas. This lack of precedent is not a reason not to proceed, but a reason to recognize the limits of what we can sensibly do, predict, and provide for. This is another reason to tread carefully. Most important, to provide a mechanism to make sure that we have acted appropriately, that mechanism is the five-year review mandated by clause 34.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807230">In conclusion, I am proud to support this bill because it introduces necessary outside review in matters of vital concern to Canadians. These matters heavily implicate both our freedom and our security. I also support it because this review is to be in the hands of the most appropriate persons, those persons being Canadian parliamentarians. The review committee would be appropriately composed and represented with a broad mandate and strong powers. This vital committee would be supported by a secretariat and executive director, whose support, I repeat, is absolutely essential. This would allow us to ensure that we are balancing our liberties and freedoms with our security.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807231">Mr. Speaker, it is loud and clear that my hon. colleague is very confident in how this committee is going to proceed. However, Canadians watching are very disappointed in how the government supported Bill <Document DbId="6842344" Type="3">C-51</Document>. They were promised during the election campaign that the amendments were going to be addressed. However, the bill that has come forward to address this has such shortcomings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807232">It was mentioned that some experts validated this committee. I want to point out that the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Canada, the Security and Intelligence Review Committee, and the Canadian Bar Association all testified that the oversight committee must not be restricted in its ability to access necessary information. It is really confounding that this committee will move forward and that has been rejected up until now.</ParaText>

However, this is at the same time the government has again invoked closure on a bill to which many parliamentarians wish to speak. When one says that 40 members have spoken on this bill fast enough, it sounds like a lot of people, but that is just barely 10% of the people who were elected to the House and who wish to address issues in the House on behalf of their constituents.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807243">The national security and intelligence committee of parliamentarians being created is incredibly important. We just have to look at what is happening right now south of the border, where congressional committees are overseeing and questioning what is happening in the FBI, the CIA and other intelligence services, to recognize that without oversight, we might well have a very unfortunate situation with power concentrated only in the executive branch.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807244">Up until today, the Canadian Parliament has been the only parliament among our Five Eyes partners that does not have a committee comprised of parliamentarians and legislators to oversee our intelligence department and agencies and to ensure that fairness, justice and rule of law values are imposed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807245">As such, I strongly agree, as I said when I campaigned in the last election, that such a committee is needed and would be much appreciated by Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807246">I also want to congratulate the committee that studied the bill. The public safety and national security committee had extensive debates on the bill, which I had the pleasure of reading over the last couple of days. The debate that went on in committee was very interesting and it shed a lot of light on the amendments brought forward and the improvements that were made to the bill. The committee heard from over 40 witnesses. Members of the committee did not necessarily agree with other members of those parties. I congratulate the committee on a thoughtful review of the bill. It stands as an excellent example of how colleagues in the House can work together to make a bill better. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807247">Let me outline a few of the amendments at committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807248"> In clause 2 and again in clause 15, the amendments made at committee will clarify that the mandate of the committee of parliamentarians includes crown corporations. This broadens the mandate of the NSICOP, and is in keeping with the intent to give that committee a government-wide review capacity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807249">In clause 5, a time frame of 60 days following the general election has been recommended for the appointment of NSICOP members, and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> will be required to consult with the leaders of caucuses and recognized groups in order to name members to the committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807250">Amendments to clause 8 to deal with the NSICOP's authority to investigate ongoing activities were made. The minister has authority to determine that an examination of ongoing activities could be injurious to national security. However, with the amendments before us, the time during which the minister can invoke this authority will be limited to the period during which the ongoing operation is injurious security. Once the review is no longer injurious to national security and once it is no longer an ongoing operation, the minister will be required to inform the committee of parliamentarians. That is an improvement to the original bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807251">The amendments to clause 14 involve exemptions to the authority to review in certain instances. The amendments would cancel those exemptions. I agree with the standing committee that the exemptions concerning ongoing defence intelligence activities in support of military operations, privileged information under the Investment Canada Act and information collected by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada should be withdrawn.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807252">There are, however, certain exemptions that I believe should remain in the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807253"> On the one hand, there are exemptions to individuals who are protected through the witness protection program and to individuals who are confidential sources. I do not think the committee of parliamentarians needs to know the identities of these individual in order to oversee security and intelligence. There is potentially the risk of harm to them if their identities become more widely known. Also, the committee of parliamentarians risks the perception of political interference in police matters should the exemption for ongoing police investigations be removed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807254"> In addition, the committee recommended that clause 16 be deleted. I do not generally support that recommendation. Clause 16 would authorize a minister to prevent disclosure of special operating information as defined by the Security of Information Act when it could be injurious to national security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807255">There will be situations in which a minister will need to avail him or herself of this prerogative in the interests of national security, but the bill also places checks and balances on this authority. The proposed amendment will require the minister to explain in writing their reasons why the authority is being invoked. This will effectively make public the minister's decision and the minister will have to contemplate the public's reaction before making use of this provision.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="55">(1655)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4807256">The equivalent committees in the other Westminster Five Eyes partners face similar and indeed generally more extensive restrictions on their access to information. In fact, the access provided to the NSICOP will broadly exceed the access afforded to the committees of our international partners. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807257">To repeat a point made earlier, under Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document>, operational reviews may only be stopped for national security reasons during the period that the operation in question is ongoing, and only if the conduct of the review will be disruptive to that ongoing operation. Once the operation is complete, the committee of parliamentarians may begin or resume its review. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807258">When the committee of parliamentarians tables its annual report to Parliament, it will be able to cite any instances where this authority has been used. In this way, we assure a degree of transparency that will enable Parliament and the Canadian public to hold the minister and the government to account. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807259">One important aspect of the proposed committee of parliamentarians would be that the government would not have a majority of members on the committee. Indeed, as now agreed and amended, the chair would have a vote only in the case of a tie. By limiting the voting powers of the chair, we further ensure that the committee's work and findings will not be controlled by the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807260">The amendments to clause 21 provide a further example of how the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security has ensured greater accountability in the legislation. Should the prime minister redact information contained in NSICOP's report, the new version of the report must be clearly identified as a revised version. On top of that, the extent of the revisions must be indicated, as well as the reasons for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807261">A new clause 31 requires NSICOP to inform the appropriate minister or the attorney general if, in its opinion, it finds any activity related to national security or intelligence carried out by a department that may not be in compliance with the law. This whistle-blower provision is a significant addition to the bill before us. I congratulate the standing committee for championing this provision. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807262">During committee stage, a wide range of witnesses shared the benefit of their experience and advice. The amendments before us today demonstrate that the committee listened to them and that the government also listened to the committee. Committee witnesses included leading professionals and academic experts, human rights advocates, and the heads of our existing national security and intelligence agencies. I thank them for their input.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807263">There has been a consensus, I believe, that the bill would improve the accountability and effectiveness of Canada's national security and intelligence system. I urge all members to join me in supporting the bill. I am pleased that the government is supporting a majority of amendments that have come back from the standing committee.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807274">Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak to Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document>, an act to establish parliamentary oversight of our security and intelligence services. Bill C-22 aims to plug a gap by giving a unique committee of nine security-cleared and secrecy-sworn MPs and senators substantial but not complete access to classified information and a whole-of-government mandate to review security and intelligence operations, policy, legislation, and administration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807275">Canada has not seen any progress toward security accountability in decades. In 1977, the government created the McDonald Commission to investigate the security services activities of the RCMP. The commission resulted in two key recommendations in its final report in 1981. The first was to separate security services from the RCMP, a recommendation that was fully implemented in 1984 with the establishment of CSIS. The other key recommendation, to create a special oversight committee of parliamentarians, was ignored and has gone ignored for decades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807276">Time after time, governments have resisted the call to create a body for parliamentary oversight of security and intelligence services. They have ignored experts in this country and around the world who have insisted that parliamentary oversight is crucial to bridging the gap between ordinary Canadians and the women and men of our intelligence services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807277">In 2005, a Liberal government bill was introduced that was almost a carbon copy of Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> in its original form. An interim committee of parliamentarians on national security, when studying that bill, actually toured allied nations and met with their oversight bodies. It too came to the conclusion that an oversight committee must be provided with complete access to classified information. Unsurprisingly, the Liberals rejected that provision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807278">Without oversight, Canada has been left behind. All of our closest allies, including those with parliamentary governments similar to ours, have adopted legislative oversight to ensure that national security efforts are being executed in the best interests of all citizens. In fact, Canada is the only member of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance with the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand that does not have any parliamentary oversight of its security and intelligence services. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807279">It is not good enough to simply look at past mistakes and attempt to evaluate where we went wrong. We need proactive, ongoing parliamentary oversight to ensure not only that everything is operating properly but to stop activities that we believe are not in the best interests of Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807280">Canadians expect a watchdog with teeth. This committee must have full access to classified information, adequate resources, independence, and, subject only to justifiable limits, the power to share its findings with Canadians in an informative and transparent manner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807281">Without adequate access to information, the committee would not be able to do its job. This work is far too important to do half-heartedly or ineffectively. We will not support creating a committee that simply wastes time and erodes Canadians' trust.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807282"> While the Liberals insisted on watering down Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> to strip parliamentarians' access to crucial information, we believe that committee members must have full access in order to provide full and thorough oversight. When law professor Craig Forcese, from the University of Ottawa, testified at committee, he remarked that "Unless the committee can access information allowing it to follow trails, it will give the appearance of accountability without the substance''. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807283">This is exactly what the Liberal government has become known for: all talk and very little action, no real commitment, just smoke and mirrors, just as we have seen with Bill <Document DbId="6842344" Type="3">C-51</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807284">If the government truly believes that there should be a committee of parliamentary oversight of security and intelligence issues, it must stop trying to strip the committee of the ability to do its job effectively.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807285">Since Bill <Document DbId="6842344" Type="3">C-51</Document> was introduced in 2015, there has been a true awakening about the balance we expect the government to uphold between our privacy rights and national security objectives. This awakening did not happen overnight. In February 2015, 82% of Canadians supported Bill C-51, but by April, the level of support was down to 33%.

The language in this bill is so broad that the definition of terrorist was watered down to individuals who practise their legal right to dissent. Under this legislation, police forces have the power to detain people they suspect of planning to break the law. The Canadian Security Intelligence Service will have new powers to arrest. These are only some of the examples of what the NDP stood against, whereas the Liberals in opposition were decidedly unreliable. They flip-flopped, ultimately deciding to amend the bill when they got into power. The problem is that they have not. The government is still playing lip service to its campaign promise.

Based on expert testimony and study, the public safety committee presented evidence-based amendments to the bill. These amendments aimed to give the committee the powers and access to information it would need to do its job effectively.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807292">Furthermore, the bill aimed to limit the power of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to censor committee reports.

Despite this, we were happy with Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> when it was amended. The amended bill fulfilled a crucial campaign promise by both the NDP and the Liberals and ensured that the committee would be both independent and well informed.

              <ParaText id="4807300"> Mr. Speaker, I want to mention again about the great integrity I felt as a candidate in my riding when people would come to talk to me about the real concerns they had about Bill <Document DbId="6842344" Type="3">C-51</Document>. It opened up the doors for people to have their ability to protest, their ability to speak out, vastly limited. A lot of indigenous leaders came to me and talked about their very serious concerns around what their rights would mean and how they were going to fight for their indigenous rights in their province and in their country. I think it is important that we remember that sometimes we have to stand up and speak up against these things, because they really silence people. We could do better. That is what we stood on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807301">As for this issue, I think it is important to remember that if this committee does not have the tools it needs to get the job done, it will be a waste of time and money for the taxpayer. Canadians in this country want to see something that works well. When we have a committee that works together, that comes together and has good discussions, and comes with amendments, and then suddenly it is changed again by the governing party, we have to ask these questions. That is why we are here. We are here to ask those questions and make sure that when a parliamentary committee is put together around a very important issue, that it is done well, that it is done meaningfully, and that it is done in a way that there are actual teeth to it. I think Canadians want to know that they are being protected and that the oversight is there. It is very unfortunate that the government has seen fit to water down this important bill.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807307">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise during this report stage to continue our review of Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document>, which would create a committee of parliamentarians on national security matters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807308"> I am pleased to see that today this bill has not only been through committee scrutiny, but thanks to all of that work, the advice of experts, many stakeholders, and the voices of Canadians, we have landed on a version that balances all those concerns. We have agreed to an expanded mandate. We have agreed to remove certain exclusions to the unprecedented level of classified information that this committee will be able to access, and we have balanced concerns about ministerial powers of redaction and national security limitations with reasonable compromises. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807309">As we have moved this significant legislation forward, much has been made about how Canada's committee will compare with counterparts in other Five Eyes countries. Indeed, Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> would have favourably compared to them as initially introduced. However, this amended version will make it even stronger. If we look closely at another country with a Westminster system comparable to Canada's, for example, the United Kingdom, we see very interesting comparisons with parliamentary review of national security and intelligence. There, in particular, the balance between access to highly sensitive information and protection of national security is reflected in the U.K. Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807310">In the U.K. model, ministers may choose to withhold certain types of sensitive information, as long as the disclosure would be counter to the interests of national security. Specifically in the U.K., its Justice and Security Act states that if asked to disclose information, the government can withhold the information because it is “sensitive information” and that “in the interests of national security, should not be disclosed..”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807311">If we look to the Australian model, similarly, the government cannot be compelled to provide operationally sensitive information, including intelligence sources, operational methods, or foreign intelligence, if that information is deemed injurious to either national security or foreign relations. All international partners agree that access to information must be balanced with the need for safety of sources and the integrity of the national security framework, and that ongoing investigations should be free of political interference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807312">Under Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document>, Canada's committee would have a statutory right to access highly classified information in any department, any agency, and now, thanks to an amendment adopted by the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security, any crown corporation, making our committee an international leader in terms of information access. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807313">To continue with comparisons, Canada's committee would also be in line administratively with other Westminster systems, for example, on security clearances. However, Canada's committee would go further still in the scope of its mandate, as its jurisdiction would not be limited to the main national security agencies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807314">Also, unique to Canada, the committee would be able to engage and collaborate with existing expert review bodies, including the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the RCMP, the Security Intelligence Review Committee for CSIS, and the Communications Security Establishment Commissioner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807315">What is more, Canada's committee would have a unique membership. We are now proposing a body with up to eleven members, including up to three senators, and with a limit of five MPs from the governing party. Certainly this will be reflective of Canada's diversity in advice and expertise, in experience, and in opinion. It will ensure that the government does not control the committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807316">I also want to emphasize that this is a made-in-Canada approach. We have taken the best of what we have learned from our allies and applied it to our own system and reality, establishing a body that is unprecedented in Canadian history. It has been lacking for a long time. This goes further than what the government under Prime Minister Paul Martin envisioned in 2005, and it goes further than what many of our allies actually have. What is more, I want to remind hon. members about the checks and balances we have in place to ensure that the committee can evolve and become stronger in the future. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4807317">As with any new institution, there will be early experiences that can lead to subsequent improvements. There will also need to be a confidence-building process with the security and intelligence community, as well as with the Canadian public, and with us as parliamentarians. In fact, when Dominic Grieve, the chair of the British committee, visited Ottawa last year, his advice was to start small, build trust, and enhance the committee over time. With Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document>, we will actually be starting rather large, with a committee that would have more access and more teeth than many of its international counterparts, including the United Kingdom. A mandatory five-year review included as part of this bill would ensure that the committee's effectiveness and experiences could be studied and lessons applied, so that this new institution in the Canadian national security landscape could become as effective as possible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807318">I see no reason at this stage of this bill's journey to hold back this truly collaborative and long-overdue legislation. It reflects values that we have long agreed upon, and the final version will incorporate, with the government's agreement, a significant number of amendments proposed by the public safety committee. I commend all members for their valued input, and I applaud the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security for its review. We are at an important juncture in the history of our country's security framework, and this bill gets to the root of the dual objectives that Canadians have told us they want achieved: keeping our country safe while protecting our values, rights, and freedoms. I urge all members to support this bill.</ParaText>

It would be much less partisan, by virtue of what is at stake. It is a made-in-Canada solution, and I believe that is absolutely essential.

              <ParaText id="4807328">Mr. Speaker, I am glad to be here this afternoon. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807329">I am not sure I have seen a bill more emblematic of the Liberals than this bill. As I sit here and listen today, I see there is all kinds of enthusiasm over there, but no assurance of any kind of effectiveness. There is all kinds of work being planned here, but it is likely to have no results. There are all kinds of appointments in the mix, but it does not look as though there would be any balance either. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807330">The Liberals made a promise in the campaign. Their promise was that they were going to set up a non-partisan parliamentary national security oversight committee. Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> is another broken promise from a government that is becoming famous for breaking them. I will talk about how it has broken that promise, but certainly there is no opportunity for this to be non-partisan or to be a real parliamentary committee, and it certainly is not going to have the oversight it should have. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807331">There are several ways to set committees up around here. The one we thought the Liberals were promising was a non-partisan parliamentary committee. I assume that if we put that in place, we would be talking about equal numbers such that the opposition would be able to contribute on an equal basis and the power on that committee would be shared, perhaps through dual chairs or sharing the chairmanship. It would have the powers of a parliamentary committee. If it was a security committee, it would probably have to deal with some sort of secrecy issues around the content of what it is looking at. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807332">There is a second opportunity, which is to set up a regular parliamentary committee that has parliamentary powers. All of us in the House sit on those types of committees. They always pretty much favour the government, because the numbers on the committee are set by the numbers we have in the House. Those committees are under the control of the government, and we recognize that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807333">There are also advisory committees of parliamentarians that can be set up, and then there is an advisory committee to the prime minister. We know the specialization that the Liberals across the way have on consultation, but typically those committees are appointed by the prime minister himself. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807334">It is interesting that we saw the Liberals promise number one, a non-partisan parliamentary committee. What they are actually trying to deliver today is number four, which is that advisory committee to the prime minister, a committee that can consult with him and that he can talk to about these issues, but one which has very little power. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807335">I want to take a bit of a look at some of the other countries involved in these committees. One of my colleagues across the way in the government a while ago talked about the United States intelligence committee structure and was actually trying to compare this structure to that. He talked about how there needs to be fairness and justice and that the rule of law must be guaranteed and protected by the bill. Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> does not do that. It does not compare in any way to the structure that is set up in the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807336">The previous speaker talked about the United Kingdom model being similar too. I am going to go through that a bit as well. I think we will find out that this committee does not have much similarity to the authority and power that the United Kingdom committees have either. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807337">There are a number of other Commonwealth countries that do have oversight committees. New Zealand, for example, has a committee, but it basically is to examine issues of efficacy and efficiencies for budgetary matters, policy settings, and those kinds of things. It really does not have much to do directly with intelligence oversight. The members of that committee are the prime minister, two members of parliament nominated by him, the leader of the opposition, and one member nominated by the leader of the opposition. We can see in that situation that the Government of New Zealand would control that committee at all times. It is basically focused on budget oversight, not intelligence gathering. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807338">The Australian model is a little bit different. It has a committee that is administrative. Its main functions are to do expenditure review and oversight there as well. It can also review matters that relate to some of the agencies that are referred to it, but it does not review intelligence gathering or operational procedures or priorities, and it does not conduct inquiries. Again, we see it is an oversight committee, but it is not what the Liberal government has promised to set up as a committee for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807339">The United Kingdom has a little stronger committee. It has a committee of parliament with greater powers. It was actually set up in 1994 as more of a monitoring committee, and in 2013 it was restructured or reformed to give it more powers and increase its strength. It now includes oversight of operational activity and the wider intelligence and security activities of government.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="30">(1730)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4807340">When people were thinking about this committee that the Liberals were promising during the campaign, they really thought that is what was going to be brought in, and it certainly is not, as we see when we look at the legislation, what the Liberals are doing to the legislation, and the work the committee did.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807341">Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> is called the “national security and intelligence committee of parliamentarians act”. Usually a committee is named for what it really is, and if that is the case here, it probably should be called “the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s advisory committee”, because while the bill may establish a committee, it clearly fails to meet either the election promise or to establish a real and true intelligence oversight committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807342">It is a bit of an embarrassment, I think, for the government to find itself having to completely change its direction from what it promised. It is unfortunate that it is using time allocation this afternoon to cover what I would call its incompetence on this issue. It is unfortunate that we find ourselves once more in the situation of the government wanting to limit debate on a bill that is clearly not going to meet the priorities and needs of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807343">We have a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who seems to love running around and appearing on stages more than he likes to do this kind of hard work, so it is not surprising to see legislation, time after time, that is written in ways that the government itself is unable to support. It has to reject the work of the committees, reject the amendments made by members from all parties in this Parliament, and basically turn its back on the promises it made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807344">The bill to set up this committee was introduced in June of 2016. The interesting thing is that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> actually appointed a chair to this committee months before the legislation was even presented and long before it was even debated. I understand the member has been travelling around the world. I guess he thinks he is doing some work on this in his committee, but it is probably a pretty good gig to be appointed before the parliamentary committee is even set up and have the government pay to travel around to examine some of these issues. At least there is one person getting something out of this, if the rest of Canadians are not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807345">As I said, forming an effective non-partisan committee was a Liberal campaign promise. Every one of us in the House would like to ensure that there is an appropriate review of our national security agencies. Conservatives believe that is important and would like the committee, when it is set up, to have the capacity and the tools to be able to do what is required. I think we would all be glad to support a committee that would properly supervise and provide oversight to our national security and intelligence organizations, but the way it is being done in the House this afternoon is a clear demonstration that this whole project is far more about optics than it is about effectiveness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807346">If this committee is put in place, we need to make sure that it has the tools to do what is required, and that clearly has not happened. I just mentioned that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> appointed a chair of the committee long before the legislation was written, or certainly before it was presented and long before it was debated. The person appointed, from my understanding, has very little expertise and does not have a history in these issues. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807347">One of the issues here is that committees usually elect their own chairs and do not have ones imposed by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807348">The Liberals promised they were going to form this committee. It is not a parliamentary committee. It is controlled by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="214300" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness</Affiliation>. I do not know how anyone in the House could possibly see a committee set up like that to be non-partisan. What does it mean when the Prime Minister has the authority to appoint the members of the committee? Again, as I mentioned earlier, if Liberals really wanted to treat this matter seriously, why would we not be talking about co-chairs and an equal number of party representatives in the House? Without that, we really have nothing useful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807349">This is just one more broken promise. The budget is being presented this week, and we will be reminded again of how many promises the government has broken. This is one more of those broken promises. This will not be a non-partisan committee. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> will be controlling it. It will not be a parliamentary committee. It will not have the powers of a parliamentary committee. What the committee gave the legislation in its work the government is now taking away. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807350">The point is that if it were going to be effective, it would not be under the control of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="214300" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness</Affiliation>. It would be under the control of the members of Parliament who sit on that committee. If there were equal numbers of members and a sharing of the chairmanship, Conservatives could see how this committee might work effectively, but the government has made a decision that it is not going to do things that way, and that is unfortunate. It is unfortunate that the government finds itself in a situation like this today, but it is even more unfortunate that Canadians will end up paying for another mistake that has been made by the Liberal government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807371">Mr. Speaker, I have the great pleasure and honour to speak today to Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807372"> This bill will give Canada its first national security and intelligence committee of parliamentarians. By enacting legislation to create this new committee, our government is fulfilling its commitment to protecting national security while ensuring the utmost respect for rights and freedoms. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807373"> I would also note that the government has made it a priority to make Parliament more useful by consolidating its institutions and mobilizing parliamentarians. The national security and intelligence committee of parliamentarians that will be created by Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> is intended to be a forum where national security agencies will be able to exchange highly classified intelligence with parliamentarians who have received the proper security clearance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807374"> The public wants national security and intelligence activities to be carried out in a responsible way. They are entitled to know that this important work is being done in accordance with the rule of law and in full recognition of individual rights, including the right to privacy. Because our government knows this is possible, it is committed to consolidating the national security framework in order to protect Canadians without compromising their values, rights and freedoms or the openness and inclusivity that this country represents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807375"> Within the strong framework laid down by Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document>, the government will be able to disclose highly classified information to a committee that will include members of both Chambers and all parties. The parliamentarians who sit on the committee will have a broad mandate, defined in the bill, that consists of verifying whether the government’s work in the realm of national security and intelligence meets high standards and is carried out rigorously and responsibly. For that reason, I would like to focus on two fundamental aspects of this bill: accountability and transparency. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807376"> People expect that we, as parliamentarians, will be able to hold the government to account concerning the work done by national security and intelligence agencies. My esteemed colleagues know that SIRC, the Security Intelligence Review Committee that oversees CSIS, the Office of the Communications Security Establishment Commissioner, for the CSE, and the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the RCMP are well established entities that were created many years ago to ensure the transparency and accountability that people expect of the corresponding agencies in their mandatory annual reports. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807377"> Each of these entities oversees a national security or intelligence agency to ensure that it adheres to the rule of law and the directives given by its minister, namely the Minister of Public Safety for SIRC and the CRCC and the Minister of National Defence for the CSE.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807378"> To date, however, Canada has not been able to address national security and intelligence issues from a government-wide perspective, that is, to cast a wider net than any of the three entities we just spoke about do, wider even than the three of them together. That is what we want to remedy with Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document>. I would like to commend the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security for the fine work it did in its examination of this important bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807379"> At this stage, the government is proposing to reinstate several important provisions of Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document>. More specifically, the government wants to reintroduce three mandatory exemptions relating to the committee’s access to classified information: first, protection of information respecting ongoing law enforcement operations; second, protection of the identity of informants and sources; and third, protection of persons in the witness protection program. This is because it is essential to guarantee the independence of police investigations and the safety and security of individuals who work in national security and intelligence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807380"> The government has also proposed an amendment that reinstates clause 16, so that ministers have the necessary discretion not to disclose certain special operational information, but only if providing the information might be injurious to national security, for example, where operations or the safety of the individuals involved are in issue. As an additional safety measure, the bill provides that a minister who exercises his or her discretion in this regard must do so on a case-by-case basis. Moreover, the minister must, under the bill, inform the committee and provide the reasons why he or she has done so. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="50">(1750)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4807381"> I congratulate the government for responding to the concerns of the standing committee while at the same time preserving the necessary protection measures and guarantees specified in the bill. I support the amendments proposed by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807382"> I also want to point out that parliamentarians must review the bill every five years, starting from the date on which it comes into force. This is an important provision, because it establishes a legislative basis that gives the committee the ability to make changes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807383"> As parliamentarians, we introduce, debate, and promulgate legislation dealing with matters of national security. The committees of the House and the Senate consider matters of national security policy and carry out studies of the government’s national security and intelligence activities and of the associated laws.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807384"> To date, however, Canadians have not had the benefit of an entity that gives parliamentarians a mandate to examine the government’s overall national security and intelligence infrastructure. That is what we are seeking to accomplish with the bill we are proposing, Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document>, an act to establish the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians and to make consequential amendments to certain acts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807385"> By creating the committee of parliamentarians proposed in Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> and holding a debate on the amendments proposed by the government at this stage of the report, we are showing Canadians that the government is resolutely taking a stance as protector of their individual rights, their freedoms, and their values, while at the same time focusing on their security and their safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807386"> That is why I intend to vote for the bill, and I encourage all my colleagues to do the same.</ParaText>

Let us have a real parliamentary committee that will really have its say, and not a committee managed by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>’s Office.

              <ParaText id="4807401">Mr. Speaker, it is a great honour to rise today to take part in this very important debate on Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807402">I feel honoured to give voice to the serious concerns that many of my constituents have in the great riding of Cowichan—Malahat—Langford. I also want to note that this debate is taking place under the yoke of time allocation. In other words, the ability of parliamentarians to provide oversight on a bill dealing with oversight has now been curtailed by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807403">Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> cannot be debated without being properly placed in the context of Bill <Document DbId="6842344" Type="3">C-51</Document> from the 41st Parliament. Bill <Document DbId="6842344" Type="3">C-51</Document> was one of the most draconian pieces of security legislation to emanate from the previous Conservative government. Indeed, more than 100 of Canada's brightest legal experts from institutions across the country sent an open letter to all members of Parliament at the time, expressing their deep concern about Bill <Document DbId="6842344" Type="3">C-51</Document>. They called that bill a dangerous piece of legislation, in terms of the potential impacts on the rule of law, on constitutionally and internationally protected rights, and on the health of Canada's democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807404">We had former prime ministers, former justices of the Supreme Court of Canada, and all sorts of experts who gave close scrutiny to Bill <Document DbId="6842344" Type="3">C-51</Document> and were convinced it was unconstitutional. Many of my constituents were very vocally opposed to Bill <Document DbId="6842344" Type="3">C-51</Document>, and indeed many of them took part in the protests that erupted across Canada during that time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807405">It was a sad day in Parliament when the Liberals joined with the Conservatives to pass that bill. I think, and many of my colleagues will agree with me, that on Bill <Document DbId="6842344" Type="3">C-51</Document>, the Liberals were indecisive, unreliable, and plain wrong to support it at the time. I do not think they realized how much of a serious misjudgement they had made with the Canadian public on the mood of Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807406">Then, when we edged closer to the 2015 election, we suddenly saw a commitment in the Liberal campaign platform to introduce new legislation that would balance collective security with our rights and freedoms. Part of that promise was to establish an all-party national oversight committee, which we see today in Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807407">In our system today, we have a history of having opposition chairs in oversight committees. Committees on ethics, public accounts, status of women, and government operations all have elected opposition chairs to ensure proper accountability and oversight. It is most unfortunate that the government, through clause 6 of the bill, has provided for the Governor in Council to designate the chair of the committee. In fact, the government has not even bothered to wait for the passage of this bill, because, as we all know, it has been widely reported that the member for <Affiliation DbId="214297" Type="2">Ottawa South</Affiliation> is to be the chair. The government has also rejected attempts at the committee stage to allow for the committee to elect its chair, something which I think is unfortunate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807408">If I could deliver one message today, it is that Canadians expect to have a watchdog and oversight committee that has real teeth. I think this committee must have full access to classified information, have adequate resources, and, most importantly, it must have independence subject only to justifiable limits and the power to share its findings with Canadians in an informative and transparent manner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807409">Without adequate access to information, the committee will not be able to do its job effectively. I think this work is far too important to do half-heartedly or ineffectively. I will not support creating a committee that cannot properly provide oversight in accordance with what Canadians expect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807410">One of the government's proposals is to allow cabinet ministers to withhold information from the oversight committee. This is evident in Motion No. 5, which the government has presented, which seeks to reinstate clause 16. It is worded in a way that allows a minister to withhold information if he or she feels that it is special operational information or that the provision of the information would be injurious to national security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807411">If injurious to national security is not a blanket statement to cover any kind of reason, I do not know what is. I have heard Liberal MPs say that there is a proper accountability in oversight because the minister simply has to inform the committee of his or her decision and the reasons for it, as if that somehow makes everything okay.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="00">(1800)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4807412">I cannot support such a reinstatement of that clause. The public safety committee and the experts who were heard made it very clear that the the executive branch having this kind of power over an oversight committee simply will not fly. It would make the committee completely ineffective anytime that a minister wanted to withhold information. With regard to the way that the government wants to write the bill, the minister could claim that a confidential inquiry somehow jeopardizes the country's national security. I think that giving the government the ability to shut down any kind of investigation into its actions is too dangerous for a functioning and accountable democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807413">The other thing is that we need to build Canadians' trust in our security and intelligence community, and the way to do that is to create meaningful parliamentary oversight. We need to have a fully briefed parliamentary oversight committee that can issue authoritative reports to Canadians. Without full access and full trust from the agencies, the oversight committee cannot help those agencies earn the trust of Canadians. It is very disappointing and frustrating that the Liberals are not living up to the commitments they made trying to fix Bill <Document DbId="6842344" Type="3">C-51</Document>. To rebuild this trust, the committee must be strong, independent, and effective. The Liberals must fulfill their promise to “repeal the problematic elements of Bill C-51”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807414">I find it very troubling that the government cannot seem to place its trust in a select group of parliamentarians who will be security cleared, sworn to secrecy, and who will have waived all immunity based on parliamentary privilege. To underline how ridiculous this premise is, I would like to point out that there are members of the Conservative Party in opposition who were once members of cabinet in the previous Parliament. At that time, they had access to all kinds of sensitive information and are still bound by secrecy. Why the government will not now trust this committee to have full access and provide proper oversight remains an elusive mystery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807415">All parties worked hard during the committee process to improve Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document>. The final product, as was reported back to this House, was praised by four of Canada's leading authorities on intelligence and oversight issues. They wrote a joint op-ed in <I>The Globe and Mail</I>, calling on the government to accept the improvements and pass the bill. The last-minute changes that the government is now trying to make are unsupported by evidence heard at the committee, and they would undermine the effectiveness of the committee and the trust of Canadians. The Information Commissioner and the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, Kent Roach and Craig Forcese, the first chair of the Security Intelligence Review Committee, and a representative of the Canadian Bar Association, all testified that the oversight committee should not be restricted in its access to necessary information. I do not understand why the government is attempting to reject that expert evidence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807416">There are three core agencies responsible for security and intelligence work in Canada: CSIS, CSE, and the RCMP. They have a combined budget of approaching $4 billion, and they employ close to 34,000 people. Clearly such a vast network needs to have the accountability and oversight of Parliament in order to regain Canadians' trust. The role of Parliament is to scrutinize the government, represent the Canadian people, and bring forth good laws to govern our people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807417"> I call on the Liberal MPs sitting in the back rows to go back to that special day on March 8 during the vote on Bill <Document DbId="8063160" Type="4">S-201</Document>, when they had the courage to stand up and assert their power as legislators in the face of the opposition from cabinet. As they did then, those Liberal MPs should reject the government's 11th-hour amendments to this bill, and instead listen to the evidence that was so clearly presented to the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security. I ask all MPs in this House to remember that the government is accountable to Parliament, not the other way around.</ParaText>

I was there when there was a great deal of opposition to Bill <Document DbId="6842344" Type="3">C-51</Document>. The Liberal Party was different from the NDP back then. We believed there was a need to see Bill C-51 passed because of a wide variety of reasons. The security of Canadians was the predominant reason. We also made the commitment back then that we would bring in the parliamentary oversight. This bill would do just that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807419">My question for the member is this. I have been a parliamentarian now for about 25 years. I know how committees work. At the end of the day, I believe in the integrity of the members who would make up that committee. A majority of that committee would not be held by government members of Parliament. The government members of Parliament would be in a minority. It would take others to be onside in order to get something passed. Does that not provide any reassurances whatsoever for members across the way?</ParaText>

However, if the member had correctly listened to my speech, I do not really care about that particular section. My main concern is with clause 16 of this bill, which still allows a minister, with this blanket provision, to keep information from that committee. No matter what the membership of the committee is, the problem is not solved if we still have a clause allowing a minister to withhold information. We need proper oversight. We need proper accountability. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807421">I do not know what the government's problem is when we have parliamentarians who are sworn to secrecy, have received security clearance, and basically have waived their right to parliamentary privilege so they will be accountable and fully subject to the law if they break that secrecy. I am not sure why the government cannot trust those parliamentarians when there are members in this House who used to be members of the previous Conservative government who are still maintaining that oath of secrecy.</ParaText>

I am still examining her proposed deletion of clause 12, because I think that in our system of checks and balances, in order to afford parliamentarians that privilege of accessing this information, there do need to be some checks. However, I do not think that the government would accept that in any case. Therefore, one of the important amendments that my colleague from Victoria has moved is the deletion of clause 31. If the government rejects everything else, we hope at least that by deleting clause 31 in this bill we can allow that accountability to a Federal Court, because we know that certain federal judges are sworn to secrecy. They deal with very sensitive information on an ongoing operational basis, and sometimes they have to issue warrants with very sensitive information. We hope that, at the very least, by eliminating clause 31, we have that recourse for the courts to actually enforce some of the things the committee is trying to do.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807427">Canadians want and need to be assured that our national security and intelligence community's activities are conducted responsibly.

              <ParaText id="4807428">Canadians also expect that we as parliamentarians are in a position to hold the government accountable as to the conduct of these activities so that both Canada's national security and Canadians' rights and freedoms are assured.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807429">Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> provides a well-designed framework within which the government would be able to share highly classified information with a statutory committee of members of the House of Commons and the Senate to be selected on a multi-partisan basis according to the provisions set out in this legislation. As members of this committee, they would be able to review the government's national security and intelligence activities to ensure this highly sensitive work is conducted responsibly and thoroughly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807430">Such a bill is long overdue. Once it is enacted and when the committee of parliamentarians becomes operational, the committee would be independent of the government for the purposes of its mandate. This would include the ability of the committee to decide which matters to review, in what priority and to what depth, while ensuring that the appropriate safeguards are firmly in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807431">Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> enables the committee to review any federal department or agency that performs national security or intelligence activities. For example, activities at the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, CSIS, the Communications Security Establishment, the Canada Border Services Agency, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and a number of other organizations would be part of the committee's responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807432">The national security and intelligence committee of parliamentarians would be unique in Canada in that it would have a government-wide mandate that sets it apart from other bodies established to review a specific agency, for example, either the Security Intelligence Review Committee, the commissioner of the Communications Security Establishment, or the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the RCMP. In this way, NSICOP represents the biggest change to the national security review structure in a generation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807433">The proposed committee of parliamentarians would review the legal, policy, and administrative frameworks that underpin national security operations. It would also be able to scrutinize the operational aspects of security and intelligence work. To do this, Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> grants the committee the powers to access the information it would need, including highly classified information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807434">It is important that hon. members appreciate that Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> has been carefully crafted to avoid unnecessary duplications of efforts within the broader national security community. This means that relevant information, such as reports, findings, and opinions, may be shared between the committee of parliamentarians and the other review bodies during the conduct of their respective work. This represents an important way of leveraging the good work of these organizations to help NSICOP get up to speed on issues and to fulfill its role in ensuring that national security and intelligence activities are in Canada's best interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807435">To ensure accountability and transparency, the national security and intelligence committee of parliamentarians would be required to report annually on its work, including its findings and recommendations, as appropriate, and these reports would be tabled in Parliament. The committee would also be able to independently issue special reports as necessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807436">Although the bill requires that reports would be submitted to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> before tabling for the sole purpose of ensuring that classified information is not contained in the reports, I want to reassure hon. members that the bill does not provide the Prime Minister with the power to change the committee's findings or recommendations. To reiterate, the intent of this provision is to ensure, in the final stages before a report becomes public, that classified information is not inadvertently included. This is in everyone's interest.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807437">It should also be noted that Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> enables the committee to provide classified reports to a minister or ministers at its own discretion. In doing so, however, the committee would still be required to include an unclassified summary of any such report in its annual report. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807438">While it is vital to involve more parliamentarians in examining how federal national security entities and agencies carry out their national security responsibilities individually or collectively, there must also be some boundaries to ensure that ministers remain fully responsible and accountable for their department's activities. Every department and agency of the security and intelligence community reports to the minister, who is ultimately responsible for its conduct. This minister is accountable to Parliament, and ultimately to Canadians, for ensuring that the organization under her or his charge carries out its duties to keep us safe, while respecting our fundamental rights and freedoms and the rule of law. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807439">With respect to access to information for the committee of parliamentarians, I believe that the amendments proposed by the government at report stage represent a balanced, reasonable approach to some of the changes proposed by the standing committee. Notably, the proposal by the government to reintroduce some of the mandatory exceptions to the committee's access in clause 14 is intended to ensure that certain categories of sensitive, highly restricted information are protected from any inadvertent release that may cause harm to individuals and/or to national security related operations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807440">The government's proposed reinstatement of clause 16, as it appeared when the bill was tabled, would further provide ministers with a mechanism to ensure that special operational information can be protected, but only where necessary to protect national security. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807441">Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document>, with the amendments proposed by the government, provides the necessary checks and balances, and I encourage hon. members to join me in supporting it. For example, if a minister determines it to be necessary to withhold information from the committee at a specific point in time to ensure the integrity of a national security operation, the minister would be required to explain the request to the committee. If disputed by the committee, the committee would have the ability to report this matter to Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807442">I can assure hon. members that Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document>, with the proposed amendments, would give the committee of parliamentarians the ability to hold the government accountable as to its national security and intelligence activities. Also, the committee would be able to play a key role in ensuring that ministers take the necessary action to address problems and to fix deficiencies within their own areas of responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807443"> I want to emphasize that the bill would provide the national security and intelligence committee of parliamentarians significant powers with which to conduct its important work. However, it is also important to add that the bill also provides support for the committee by creating a professionally staffed secretariat.</ParaText>

It is arguably some of the best legislation, even in comparison to other Five Eyes countries that have parliamentary oversight legislation. Perhaps she could provide her thoughts on the significance and importance of providing that oversight for Canadians. </ParaText>

Oftentimes that duty comes with oversight. For something as important as national security and our intelligence agencies, it is members of the House who ultimately must ensure that the rule of law and human rights, that all of these things are always being upheld. In my opinion, it is for that reason that this oversight committee is long overdue. I think it is what Canadians expect of us and expect of a reasonable government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807450">The member talks about how great the bill is, but we know that the proposed changes by the opposition in committee were not accepted by the Liberals. We know the Liberals are trying to withhold information from this new security and intelligence committee to do its job. There is censorship. The PMO has oversight over the ability of the non-partisan, all-party committee to get down to the heart of whether our Charter of Rights and Freedoms and privacy are being protected, whether our national security agencies, such as CSIS, CSEC, the RCMP, the National Security Agency or an investigation agency within national defence, are performing their duties and responsibilities in a way that not only protects Canadians, but also protects our privacy rights and our Charter rights.</ParaText>

Frankly, I do not take many lessons from the members of the Conservative Party who, in the previous government, decided never to consult with Canadians on matters like this and instead decided to impose their will and their opinions. This balance is what Canadians expect of us.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807454">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to speak today in support of Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document>, an act to establish the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians and to make consequential amendments to certain acts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807455">After considering this bill at second reading and reviewing it in committee, we now have the opportunity to examine it at report stage. The sound parliamentary process has served us well. The bill was carefully reviewed by members from all parties in the House, who listened to advice from expert witnesses, and the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security proposed amendments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807456">As currently worded, the bill will move our country towards a more accountable and effective national security system. The creation of a new national security and intelligence committee of parliamentarians will allow the government to keep one of its major promises to Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807457">This committee will be a very important addition to our parliamentary landscape and will allow the following: extraordinary access to classified information in order to closely examine intelligence and security operations; increased scrutiny of national security and intelligence activities; a broader mandate than that of corresponding committees in other modern democracies; the ability to develop its own agenda completely independent from government; the duty to be accountable to Canadians by reporting annually to Parliament; and the power to examine activities across the entire federal government, including ongoing operations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807458">Under the current version of this legislation, the committee must meet the dual objectives we set in that regard at the outset: ensuring that our national security apparatus works properly in order to keep Canadians safe, while also protecting Canadians' rights and freedoms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807459">When this bill was first introduced, it proposed a more robust committee than those of many of our international allies. The amendments would further broaden the scope, powers, and access we are proposing for the committee, and the government indicated that it would accept most of those amendments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807460">With respect to the scope, for example, we all agree that the committee must have the authority to examine all operations related to national security and intelligence. As amended, this would now include the activities of crown corporations. Furthermore, according to the amendments, if the minister were to determine that a study would be injurious to national security, his power to delay would be limited to the time during which the activity is underway. The committee could examine the activity afterwards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807461">The provision concerning whistleblowers is another important amendment that would require the committee to inform a minister and the attorney general of any activity related to national security or intelligence undertaken by a department that may not be in accordance with the law. Like my colleagues, I am pleased to see that this amendment received broad support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807462">I also agree that the committee chair should have a vote in the event of a tie. I also agree with the many changes regarding exemptions to access to information that the bill initially proposed. The recent amendments, for example, will allow the committee to receive information about activities under way, related to defence intelligence, in support of military activities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807463">The Committee will also have access to pertinent information collected by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada and the information protected by the Investment Canada Act. The government also agreed to amend the bill so that the reason for any redaction is provided.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807464">The government was open to reasonable amendments throughout the parliamentary process. Not only did we carry out a careful study of this vital bill, but we also benefited from many years of reflection on the creation of a committee, and a long collaboration with international partners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807465">Each member of the Five Eyes alliance, including Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, has a legislative body with access to classified information in order to monitor national security issues.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807467"> Today, we are taking one more step toward implementing this important new body. We are getting closer to a system in which parliamentarians are in a better position to hold the government accountable. We can have greater assurance that concrete measures are taken when we target the flaws and problems associated with our security framework and operations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807468"> We have learned lessons from some of our allies’ best practices. We are getting closer to a genuinely Canadian approach to accountability when it comes to national security. This is a major step forward for Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807480">However, I want to speak to a very important issue as the last speaker in this debate. What is interesting to me is to see the level of control that is going on within the Liberal government and within the Prime Minister's Office. In the election campaign the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> talked about doing things differently, holding his hand over his heart saying that for Canada things will be better, yet here we are, dealing with a time allocation situation. There have not been that many speakers, quite frankly, to speak to this very important issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807481">The reality is that this was a campaign promise that was made by the Liberal government, and it is effectively fast-tracking it through Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807482">As I prepared to speak to this issue in the short time that I had, I saw that a Google search on Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> shows us the level of concern that exists among Canadians, and certainly it has been been editorialized as well that we have to make sure we get this right. Getting it right is important. That means giving oversight of this committee to this body, to Parliament, not having it consolidated through the PMO. It means making sure that information is accessible to this committee. That is extremely important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807483">I know that the NSICOP would report to the Prime Minister's Office when it should be reporting to Parliament. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> campaigned on a reduced role for the Prime Minister's Office, but again his actions do not speak to and certainly do not follow those words. There were several amendments that were proposed at the public safety committee to make this security committee much more effective. Some of those proposals and amendments would have provided truly effective scrutiny for members of Parliament on this oversight committee, yet they were rejected. As a result, the committee will not have the power it needs in order to have true oversight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807484">A lot of discussion has gone on about our Five Eyes allies. What the government has done is it has not used some of the examples from the United Kingdom with respect to a very similar parliamentary committee that the U.K. has. The new committee does need the powers to ensure that it has this democratic oversight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807485">One of the issues that is concerning all of us is that this bill, Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document>, was tabled in the final hours of the last session of Parliament to ensure there would be virtually no debate. That is effectively what is happening here. The government is shutting down debate on this issue. My colleagues and I on this side do not think that needs to be done. However, it is a systemic pattern of the current government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807486"> I go back to the campaign. I know the government can criticize the time allocations brought by the previous government all it wants, but when we go back to the throne speech, when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s words were delivered by the Governor General in the Senate, it said that every voice in this chamber would be heard. In the throne speech it said that every member who represents Canadians will have their say, yet so far, not many voices in this chamber have been heard. Those voices were even echoed at committee, yet the Liberals, through the committee, decided that they would not accept any of the amendments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807487">I am pleased to say that there are a couple of amendments that we will be voting on this evening. One is from the member for <Affiliation DbId="214382" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation>. This motion was moved to remove the provision of the bill that states that the national security and intelligence committee of parliamentarians is not protected by parliamentary privilege. This is an amendment that is easily supportable, because the committee proposed by the legislation would make any type of disclosure or whistle-blowing from the proposed committee liable to prosecution under the Security of Information Act. That is a critical element.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="40">(1840)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4807488">The member for <Affiliation DbId="214060" Type="2">Beloeil—Chambly</Affiliation> is also proposing an amendment to the motion, and this amendment to the motion is due for consideration because it would partially stifle the Liberal attempt to remove powers of the proposed committee. That really is the basis of concern with respect to this piece of legislation. Just what powers will the committee have, and how much of that power will be controlled by the Prime Minister's Office? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807489">The other area of concern, and it has been mentioned several times, is that the committee chair has already been appointed. The committee chair was known a year ago, even before this legislation came to Parliament. Do we know the qualifications of the chair? Is this just a partisan play, in saying to a member that the member will not be in cabinet but will be put in charge of this important committee? It is not a committee of Parliament but effectively is turning out to be a committee of the Prime Minister's Office. Will it be a political arm of the Prime Minister's Office? A fair question for Canadians to ask is, what are the qualifications of the members who are going to be on this committee?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807490">We on this side of the aisle understand how important it is for government to look after the safety and security of its citizens. Many times in the history of this Parliament it has been argued, and I would argue the same thing, that this is the number one priority of government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807491">The committee will view a lot of information, but unfortunately the truth is that it is not going to get to see all the information that it needs. In order for the committee to be effective, in order for it to achieve its objective as a true national security committee of Parliament, it needs as much information as it can get. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807492">Furthermore, the committee should report to Parliament. Parliament represents Canadians. We are the ones that the committee should report to.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807610">Mr. Chair, I want to thank this House for the opportunity to lead this important debate on the extension of Operation Unifier, a critical part of our assistance to support Ukraine sovereignty, security, and stability. I am confident that all hon. members will support Canada's ongoing efforts to support the people of Ukraine and to help them defend their territory.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807611">Earlier this month, the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> and I were pleased to announce the extension of Unifier until March 2019. The extension means that Canada will continue to support the professional development of the Ukrainian armed forces, an institution that is essential for the sustainable stabilization and development of Ukraine. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807612">Canada is deploying approximately 200 Canadian Armed Forces personnel to Ukraine until the end of March 2019. Canadian Armed Forces members will come from all parts of Canada, bringing with them their unique skills and capacities in support of Unifier training programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807613">Last summer, together with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, I had the honour of visiting our troops and seeing them in action, in Yavoriv, working with their Ukrainian partners. I was proud and I was impressed. We are privileged to have them represent us in Ukraine. On behalf of this House, on behalf of the government, I would like to say to all of our troops in Ukraine, we thank them very much. <I>Dyakuyu</I>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807614">Many members in this House know that the people of Ukraine have very close ties with the people of Canada. Diversity is our strength. In fact, our countries have enjoyed a close relationship going back more than 125 years. The first two Ukrainian settlers, and members can imagine how brave they were, arrived in Montreal on board the steamship SS <I>Oregon</I> in 1891. This marked the beginning of many waves of Ukrainian immigration to Canada, waves that would help build some of the most vibrant and caring communities across our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807615">Ukrainian immigrants played a particularly important role in settling the Canadian prairies, where I, and many members of this House, grew up. Our Ukrainian-Canadian community played a central role in creating what I considered to be one of Canada's greatest political ideas and accomplishments: multiculturalism. There are now over 1.2 million Canadians of Ukrainian descent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807616">However, Canada's support for Ukraine goes beyond the strong and long-standing human ties between our countries. We support Ukraine because of our values. We support Ukraine because we support democracy. We support Ukraine because we support the sanctity of borders. We support Ukraine because we support the international rule of law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807617">Today Canada stands alongside Ukraine in defending its borders and sovereignty against illegal acts of aggression. Canada has led its G7 partners in condemning Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and the invasion of Crimea. We continue to take action to help the people of Ukraine defend their country and to stabilize and rebuild their economy. Canada has imposed sanctions against Russian and Ukrainian individuals and entities and has announced more than $700 million in assistance to Ukraine and more than $240 million in development assistance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807618"> As Canadians have heard from the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> and from me, the extension of Operation Unifier will support the professional development of the Ukrainian armed forces, who are essential in deterring aggression and creating a safe space for the sustainable social and economic development the people of Ukraine need and deserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807619">Last summer I was honoured to sign, in Kiev, in the presence of our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko, the Canada-Ukraine Free Trade Agreement. I am delighted and grateful that it was unanimously supported by all members of this House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807620">These measures, taken with strong cross-party support and with strong support across our country, are working. The Ukrainian economy has overcome the shock of this ongoing conflict and has actually been growing for the past year. Foreign investment, including by such Canadian flagships as Fairfax Financial, is resuming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807621"> Decentralization, supported by our local economic development programs, is putting resources into the hands of grassroots communities, resulting in modernized hospitals and social services. An honest and trusted new police force, with a significant female presence, is on the streets of the country's 32 biggest cities, thanks in part to the great work of committed Canadians, like Montreal's Natalia Shuster, who I was pleased to meet in Ukraine last summer.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="25">(2025)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4807622">Canada's support for Ukraine has only grown stronger in the face of unprecedented challenges to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity stemming from Russia's illegal invasion and annexation of Crimea in March 2014 and its ongoing support to the separatists in eastern Ukraine. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807623">We were in opposition at the time, but I and my party were pleased to support the government of the day when Canada joined the international community in immediately condemning Russia's occupation of Crimea, and we supported United Nations General Assembly resolution 68-262, which affirmed the General Assembly's commitment to the territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807624">Canada has also imposed sanctions against key officials involved in the annexation. Additional sanctions related specifically to Crimea were subsequently introduced. Most recently, in November 2016, our government imposed sanctions against an additional 15 individuals, including six who were elected to the Russian State Duma from the illegally annexed territory of Crimea. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807625">Let me be very clear: Canada does not and will not recognize Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="4807626">We have also been clear that we will continue to strongly condemn Russia's continued support for the separatist insurrection in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine. The sharp rise in violence in and around Avdiivka earlier this year reminds us that the civilian population in the conflict zone pays a heavy price. An estimated 20,000 people had to go without electricity, potable water, or heating when temperatures threatened to drop to -20 degrees Celsius. That is why it was possible for Ukrainians to come to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807627">We will continue to pressure Russia, including through the current sanctions, to fully implement the commitments it made under the Minsk agreements and use its influence on the separatists to meet its obligations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807628">The ultimate goal of our support is to promote the security, stability, and prosperity of Ukraine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807629">We will continue to build on the solid foundation that we have established with Ukraine and we will continue to engage in a rich and mutually beneficial partnership based on common values and a commitment to regional and international security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807630">When I was Minister of International Trade, I had the honour of attending the signing of the Canada-Ukraine Free Trade Agreement. Now, as Minister of Foreign Affairs, I look forward to exploring opportunities to further strengthen our close and mutually beneficial relationship with Ukraine.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807632">This really is Ukraine's great testing moment. I think the people of Ukraine are showing themselves to be ready and I am proud that the people of Canada are showing themselves ready to support the people of Ukraine. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807633">In this House we often disagree. Indeed, one of the reasons we are here is to highlight for Canadians the differences between our parties. However, when it comes to the issue of Ukraine and the issue of the values we are standing for in supporting Ukraine, all of us are united. This is truly not a partisan issue, and I am glad to be here to speak up for Ukraine and for Canada's support for Ukraine. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807635">I was in Ukraine, as the hon. minister knows, from February 28 to March 3, on a humanitarian mission with One Free World International. There are over one million displaced persons in Ukraine right now. They have been displaced by the horrific war that is still going on. It is not a cold war, but a hot war in the Donbass region. I visited the military hospital. Many Canadian doctors are there, working overnight shifts because there are young men who need their help after being in the war zone. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807636">I also met with a number of Ukrainian officials. They worried about the corruption in their society still and how Canada could help them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807637"> I have a three-part question for the hon. minister. I know we have Operation Unifier, which is amazing and should be continued, but how can we help combat corruption? How can we help make sure Ukrainian soldiers can better defend their homeland? How can we help the displaced persons who need our help?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807638">Mr. Chair, I would like to thank the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214103" Type="2">Parry Sound—Muskoka</Affiliation> for his very strong and long-standing support for Ukraine and for taking a position on this issue in particular which does rise above partisanship. I am pleased to acknowledge that here, and it shows how the House can be a really great and strong place in support not only of Ukrainian democracy but Canadian democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807639">On the issues that the member opposite raised, I would like to join with him in highlighting the very important work that many Canadian members of civil society are doing in supporting the people of Ukraine, particularly on the medical side. We all have people in our constituencies who are providing humanitarian aid and doctors who are working there. I was in touch with one woman in my constituency yesterday who is involved in such an effort, and we should salute those private efforts of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807640"> Definitely our government is engaged in humanitarian support for the people of Ukraine. As the hon. member mentioned, that includes medical support, but we need to think about what we can do for those displaced people. It really is a crisis. I spoke about Ukraine's economic performance. It is important for us, as we consider what the Ukrainian government is able to do, to appreciate that this is happening against the backdrop of an ongoing hot military conflict and a backdrop of a huge internal displaced persons crisis. That makes what the government has managed to do really all that much more impressive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807641">To the point the member raises about corruption, like him, I have heard concerns about corruption from many Ukrainians. Perhaps as Ukraine's strongest friends in the international community, we need to support both Ukraine civil society and the Ukrainian government in fighting against that corruption. At the end of the day, important though we all know Operation Unifier to be, I ultimately think Ukraine's sovereignty is going to be secured on the economic battlefield. If Ukraine is able to reform its economy, to reform its political institutions, to end corruption, then Ukraine will be strong enough to remain independent. There is a lot of work that Canada is able to do to help Ukraine in that effort.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807643">I am glad that the minister raised the issue about civil society. I had the privilege a number of years back to travel with the foreign affairs committee to Ukraine, before the government changed, to look into the erosion of rule of law and the erosion of democracy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807644">I met with representatives of the media, representatives of families who had been jailed, representatives of families who had been kicked out of the country. I heard concerns from human rights organizations. It is great that we now have a trade agreement with Ukraine. The problem is that we need to give more support to civil society to make sure that all Ukrainians benefit from economic development. As members in this place have mentioned, there is continuing corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807645">Does the minister agree that the government should be increasing its support to civil society? Young Ukrainians like the ones who have come here to intern have gone back to Ukraine and want to work with the government toward their direct engagement in the future of their country—not just in the development of the economy, but in creating better courts and a better judicial system.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807647">The member referred to the Canada-Ukraine Free Trade Agreement. I know that my colleagues in the New Democratic Party are not always wildly enthusiastic about trade agreements, so I was particularly pleased that the NDP supported, together with the rest of the House, the Canada-Ukraine Free Trade Agreement. That says a lot about the cross-party support in this House for Ukraine and a lot about the understanding we all have that supporting Ukraine economically is such a central part of the support we can give that country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807648">As I said earlier, I share with the member opposite a real admiration for and belief in the power of Ukrainian civil society. That is probably the strongest element of Ukraine right now. It is what Ukraine really has going for it: an active, engaged, often querulous, courageous, unafraid-to-criticize-the-government civil society, particularly with very engaged young people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807649">Canada's government and Canadian civil society are very closely engaged with Ukrainian civil society. We are already working hard to support them. However, I would agree with the member opposite that this is a group of people we should be working closely with and supporting. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807650">The member opposite referred to the parliamentary internship program. A lot of us have worked with Ukrainian parliamentary interns. It has been a pleasure for me to go to Ukraine and discover how many members of this new democratic government of Ukraine cut their teeth learning about democracy in this House. I certainly join with the member opposite in strongly supporting that effort.</ParaText>

I will quickly say that one reason I had no problem voting for the Canada-Ukraine Free Trade Agreement was that it did not include an investor state provision that had been brought in separately in advance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807654">I appreciate that it is a badge of honour for the minister personally to have been singled out by Vladimir Putin for sanctions, but on the other hand, the situation in the region is one in which we do not want to let things devolve into black and white. Crimea is clearly culturally different and it is Russian in its makeup. Solzhenitsyn, even as the USSR was falling apart, asked what would be done for Russian nationals who had been distributed through all of these other states. There is a complexity here that I do not want us to lose so that we can play a diplomatic role. </ParaText>

That is why the world community has been united in opposing them, and that is why our government is proud to oppose them clearly and unambiguously.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807660">Mr. Chair, it is indeed an honour to speak about Operation Unifier. I want to thank the minister for her comments, and I want to thank the Liberal government for extending the Conservative Party's original Operation Unifier. It is the same in size and scope, and has the same ideal, which is to provide the training that so many military in Ukraine need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807661">We have to remember that when this battle broke out, when Russia invaded and illegally occupied and illegally annexed Crimea, Ukraine's military had been somewhat decimated under the leadership of President Yanukovych. Yanukovych had taken away their ability to train and their ability to fight. He had sold the Ukraine military equipment and machine behind it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807662">To hear the member for <Affiliation DbId="214382" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation> talk about a coup, she is completely discrediting the students, the citizens of Kiev, the citizens of Lviv, the citizens right across Ukraine who took to the streets to protest against the corrupt government of Viktor Yanukovych and everything that he stood for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807663">He turned his back, after negotiating a comprehensive economic free trade agreement and co-operation agreement with Europe that actually was the catalyst for the people of Ukraine, especially the youth, tired of being lied to by Viktor Yanukovych and his regime. He was there, propped up by Vladimir Putin, propped up by illegal money coming in from the Russian mafia, funnelled through Donbass, especially through Donetsk. That individual robbed the treasury of the people of Ukraine. He took all of the gold reserves, all of the cash reserves, and fled to Rostov-on-Don in Russia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807664">That was not a coup. It was not orchestrated by anyone in the west. This was a citizens' revolution of dignity on the Euromaidan that took place in Kiev and across Ukraine. We must never, ever forget that. For anyone to come in here with fake news from RT television, Russia Today television, I can say upsets me, as members can tell, to no extent of my better judgment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807665">I have to say that as Conservatives, although we are happy that the government has extended Operation Unifier, we did present the government a couple of weeks ago with our own Ukrainian defence and aid package, because there is so much to be done. There is so much that Ukraine has asked for. There is so much that the Ukrainian community has called upon the Government of Canada to continue to do. The Ukrainian Canadian Congress sent out a great briefing to all members of Parliament for tonight's debate talking about what needs to happen, what the background is for those members who are not familiar with everything that has taken place in Ukraine, of the interference that is coming from Vladimir Putin and the regime in the Kremlin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807666">I have to share my sentiments with the <Affiliation DbId="229209" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation>. I know she is sincere. She is as passionate as I am about Ukraine and everything that Ukraine stands for. As prairie farm kids of Ukrainian heritage, she and I share that ideal and connection to the homeland of our baba and gido and want to make sure that our families' roots of the old country, as we always called it out in the Prairies, are never forgotten, and that we stand with the people of Ukraine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807667">As is being demonstrated tonight in the debate here, we are in solidarity with the people of Ukraine. We stand with them in their support of democracy. We stand with them as they want to have reform of their judicial system, of their economy. As the minister alluded to, the negotiation of the Canada-Ukraine free trade agreement started under the previous Conservative government of Stephen Harper and was finalized by the minister herself. I thank her for carrying the ball over the goal line and making sure that this deal happened to ensure that Ukraine has that opportunity for economic prosperity. That will be the telling tale at the end of the day, that Ukraine has succeeded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807668">On top of expanding and continuing Operation Unifier, I have to thank the brave men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces. Even though the government just announced a week and a half ago that it was extending the mission for another two years, fresh troops, fresh trainers out of the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry stationed in Edmonton were deployed more than three weeks ago. They are on the ground doing the training. They have taken over from the troops that are returning to Canada. I thank all members of the Canadian Armed Forces who are over there helping Ukraine. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807669">As a former parliamentary secretary to the minister of defence I had the opportunity to accompany our delivery of non-kinetic defensive equipment for the military of Ukraine. I am talking 70,000 pairs of boots, winter coats, jackets, night vision goggles, and also the supply of RADARSAT imagery which is so important. Unfortunately, last year the government cancelled that program. I still call upon the Liberals to reinstate RADARSAT 2 imagery. It was saving lives. When he visited here two years ago, President Poroshenko said in the House that RADARSAT 2 imagery was saving lives. We shared that data so Ukraine knew what the Russian-backed rebels were doing in Donbass. When it could see the movement of troops and heavy artillery across the Russian border into Ukraine, Ukraine's troops were able to reposition themselves accordingly. Without those radar images from RADARSAT 2, we are putting those troops in danger.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807670">As we have witnessed since the end of 2016, the Minsk agreements are not at all being enforced. They are not being respected by Russia. They are definitely not being respected by the Russian-backed rebels in Donetsk and Luhansk, and Ukraine is paying the price.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807671">It is contingent upon us, especially the Government of Canada, to resupply Ukraine's military with RADARSAT images so it knows what the Russians are up to and what equipment they are providing and it does not just rely on intel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807672">We called on the government to add Ukraine to the automatic firearms country control list so that officials could come to Canada and buy Canadian-made weapons. They have to be able to defend themselves. If we could supply them with sniper rifles, Javelin missiles, anti-tank missiles, if we could provide them with the equipment to take out any short-range mortar attacks and defend their sovereignty, defend their troops, defend civilians in Ukraine, they would be better off. Canada would be better off and all of NATO would be better off if Ukraine was better able to defend itself. If the Ukrainian military had the equipment it needs to stop the advancement of Russia and its imperialistic advancement into eastern Ukraine, and who knows how far it is willing to go, Ukraine would be able to slow down the progress and prevent us some point down the line from having to put our troops in harm's way to stop this war in Ukraine. We definitely do not want to see it spread to other NATO members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807673">I do appreciate that Canadian troops are going to Latvia as part of Operation Reassurance, that our CF-18s are going to be redeployed in NATO, as the Conservative government did, to do Baltic air policing and air policing in Romania, Iceland, and other countries. I also appreciate that our frigate from the Royal Canadian Navy is always in the Mediterranean, in the Black Sea and in the Baltic Sea.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807674">In the past, the <Affiliation DbId="229209" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> has called for Magnitsky-style legislation. I tabled a bill in the House. Our colleague Conservative senator Raynell Andreychuk has Bill <Document DbId="8232682" Type="4">S-226</Document> in the Senate, which is at third reading stage. I call upon the government to support that bill when it comes to the House of Commons so that we can have Magnitsky-style legislation to put in place the proper sanctions for corrupt foreign officials and stop the abuse that is happening at the hands of the people of Ukraine and the people of Russia and other countries around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807675">I just wish the minister would put in place the sanctions that she herself had called for. When she was in the opposition as a member of the third party, she used to call repeatedly for the government to sanction Igor Sechin and Vladimir Yakunin and still they are not sanctioned. The minister will have to explain that one herself. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807678">Mr. Chair, I, along with the member, was privileged to be part of the defence committee delegation that was in Washington, D.C., two weeks ago. What was most striking to me was the assurances we received no matter whom we met with. People felt that Putin would challenge President Trump, that he was certain to challenge him. From almost everyone who was asked more specifically from where that challenge would come, the answer was Ukraine. Therefore, I am glad we are having this debate tonight. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807680">Mr. Chair, I want to thank my colleague, the NDP critic for defence, for the great work that he does on the defence committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807681"> I share his view that there is definitely a concern in Washington, as there is here, that Russia is no longer a trusted partner in the geopolitics not only of eastern Europe and Ukraine but also with respect to the aggression it is showing around the world, and its complete dismissive attitude toward other world leaders and the rule of law from an international standpoint. What it did in Crimea is a case in point on how it is prepared to redraw international boundaries without any respect or apprehension at all for how the world may react. We do have to continue isolating Vladimir Putin on the world stage. We have to continue the sanctions until Russia and the people of Russia realize that the path they are on is not acceptable to the world as a whole.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807682">There is a concern from the lessons learned on how Vladimir Putin thinks. The member is correct in pointing out that Vladimir Putin will test President Trump. He tested President Obama early on in his presidency when President Obama made the decision that he was going to draw a red line on whether or not he was going to bring military action against Syria for the use of chemical weapons and then did nothing. That was the signal for Vladimir Putin to actually invade Ukraine. When he sees someone waffling, he takes it as a weakness and an opportunity to advance his own imperialistic aspirations to expand the Russian Federation. Although Vladimir Putin is KGB trained, has been the President of Russia for a very long time, and is probably the richest man in the world, we have to also realize that this individual has an imperialistic view of a return of the old days, not of the Soviet Union but of the Russian empire itself.</ParaText>

Perhaps the hon. member can describe in more detail the legal framework that was based on the fact that the major powers guaranteed the sovereignty and the borders of Ukraine at the time it gave up its nuclear arsenal at the breakup of the Soviet Union.

              <ParaText id="4807684"> Mr. Chair, I want to thank our public safety critic. He knows all too well that the Budapest memorandum was signed in 1991 by the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Ukraine, and Russia, five partners, who all said that they would honour the sovereign territory of Ukraine if they gave up their nuclear warheads. It was the second-largest arsenal in the world, even ahead of the United States at that time. They gave it all up. Where did most of those nuclear warheads go? They ended up back in Russia to be dismantled, to be disposed of. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807685">How were they paid back? Just over 20 years later, they were invaded by Russia itself. Mother Russia came back to claim what they consider to be Russian territory.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807686">We have to remember that Ukraine existed before Russia did. We have to remember that the Crimean Tatars, the indigenous people of Crimea, have said no to this invasion and illegal occupation and now are being banned of their human rights. They are no longer allowed to worship in their mosques. They are no longer allowed to meet and associate together in their parliamentary assembly, the Mejlis. They are no longer allowed to produce their papers or have their radio stations or television stations. Freedom of speech and freedom of the press have been completely removed by the Russian occupier in Crimea. The Kremlin illegally annexed it, they fixed the referendum, and the world did not honour the Budapest memorandum.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807687">What do these legal treaties and world laws mean if nobody is going to enforce them? The least that we can do, as Canada, is to continue to isolate Vladimir Putin and the regime in the Kremlin from carrying out their aspirations on the world stage, ignore them in international organizations, and work through other groups like NATO to force them back to the table and out of Ukraine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807688">Crimea is Ukraine, Donbass is Ukraine, and Canada will always stand with the people of Ukraine.</ParaText>

I accompanied some of those equipment deliveries in 2014 and 2015. At that point, we had just signed the second Minsk agreement. That agreement was holding. It was working. We were participating in the co-operation training agreement with the United Kingdom and the United States in training up Ukrainian forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807693">However, in the last six months, the Minsk agreements are no longer holding. The violations are rising on a daily basis. Troops are killed and injured every single day. There have been 10,000 Ukrainians who have been killed because of the situation. The military in Ukraine have been trained up by Canadian, British, and American forces to provide them with the equipment to properly defend themselves, such as sniper rifles, anti-tank missiles, anti-ballistic missiles, ways of dealing with mortar attacks, and also blocking radar from Russian sources. Things like proper radio equipment and night vision goggles are needed now. Those things are always needed and are something that we should be supplying without any hesitation. However, the lethal weapons are required for Ukraine to protect their citizens, first and foremost, and to make sure that this war in Donbass does not spread to the rest of Europe.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807695">I am pleased to rise in the debate tonight to support Canada's recent decision to extend Operation Unifier for the next two years. This is a very welcome commitment to the promotion of stability, not just in Ukraine, but in the wider scope of eastern Europe. It is also an important commitment to the preservation of international law in the face of Russian aggression.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807696">Ukraine represents a strategic opportunity for NATO member countries at this time to display a strong and unified front against Russian aggression, both by providing military support to Ukraine and by keeping up the diplomatic pressure on Russia over its role in the occupation of Crimea and its role in eastern Ukraine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807697">In addition to Canada's military involvement, though, there is an important role for us to play in supporting Ukraine's democratic development. In the former soviet state, if we are to have long-term stability, Canada needs to be a partner in supporting Ukraine's civil society organizations, in helping to build good governance and economic stability, as well as in providing the military training support and non-lethal military aid that we are providing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807698">The deep corruption in Ukraine is also a threat to its own stability, as much as I would say are the Russian-backed fighters in eastern Ukraine. Therefore, Canada's role in Ukraine must include assistance in addressing this corruption for the long-term positive progress of Ukraine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807699">In the limited time I have tonight, I do not want to forget to thank the Canadian troops who are doing the training in Ukraine. One of the things we heard in Washington when I was there two weeks ago with the defence committee was the recognition from the Americans that there are two things they can count on from Canadian troops: one is their high skill levels, and two is their professionalism. As much as the training is about skills, I think it is also very important that the professionalism of the Canadian military become an example for those in Ukraine, where too often corruption has played a major role.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807700">In the storm of everyday events around the world, and I suppose I would say the storm of tweets from the U.S. President, it can be too easy to forget that the situation is quite fragile in eastern Ukraine. The United Nations estimates that more than 10,000 civilian deaths have occurred since the beginning of this conflict. Now there is an estimate that 3.8 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance and that 1.7 million of those people have been displaced by this conflict. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807701">We often pay attention, as we should, to the number of displaced and internally displaced people in the Middle East, but we should not at the same time forget that the same situation is of crisis proportions in eastern Ukraine. We understand that the humanitarian situation, as of the end of January, early February, began to deteriorate even faster in the Donetsk region, amid the outbursts of violence and the disruption of the supposed ceasefire. According to UNICEF, at least one million children are now in need of humanitarian assistance. Again, the daily violations of the ceasefires that are taking place put the children's physical safety and psychological well-being at risk as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807702">At the same time, we have to remind ourselves that the human rights situation on both sides of this conflict is often not very good. The reports on civilians in detention, both on the Russian side of the line and in Ukraine, are subject to serious human rights abuses. Certainly we have more influence over what happens in Ukraine. This is an example where Canada needs to work with the authorities to better train police, to better train prison officials, and to give them that example of Canadian professionalism that is of such a high standard here in our country. However, we will also have to keep up diplomatic pressure on Ukraine to do better in the human rights and democracy area. There is no better way, no more secure way, to defeat what Russia intends to do in eastern Ukraine than by promoting democracy in Ukraine itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807703">The NDP remains concerned by the ongoing Russian-backed violence in Ukraine and the continued violation of ceasefire agreements. That is why we support the training mission, and that is why we support continuing to provide non-lethal military assistance to Ukraine. </ParaText>

There are over 20 Ukrainian citizens who have been kidnapped from Ukrainian territory into Russia, and they are currently incarcerated within Russia. It is well documented by international human rights organizations that they have often been severely tortured, and they have undergone show trials in some cases. Considering this, would the NDP support efforts, first, to sanction those individuals who have been involved in the kidnapping, and, second, in the prosecution and show trials of Ukrainian citizens who have been kidnapped from Ukraine and are incarcerated in Russia at this time?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807707">Madam Chair, we have all along argued that sanctions against individuals in Russia who are responsible for human rights abuses should be stepped up and that people we know are involved in both corruption and human rights abuses should be placed on those lists. We have been disappointed that the government has been slow to move on some of those additions to the lists for sanctions. We would, of course, support that at any time. However, it is also true that we have to keep up the pressure on Russia on so many fronts at the same time. If Canada does not play this role, for instance, by leading the mission in Latvia, and does not continue this assistance to Ukraine, Russia would only be emboldened with regard to further territorial ambitions and also further human rights abuses.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807708">Madam Chair, I want to ask my friend from the NDP from Esquimalt about the experience he has had. Russia is trying to position itself in Ukraine, in eastern Europe. Why does he believe that Vladimir Putin and the regime he has at the Kremlin have been so disruptive in supporting any semblance of democracy, of human rights, of respecting the rule of law? How does the member feel that Canada could do better in addressing those concerns, whether from the standpoint of increasing sanctions or of trying to open dialogue with the rebels themselves? Do we need to continue on this path of supporting Ukraine to ensure that Ukrainians have the ability to, one, defend their sovereignty; two, protect their citizens; and, three, ensure that their rule of law is respected as they try to reform themselves economically through democracy and through their judiciary?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807709">Madam Chair, it is a pretty broad question and tonight's time is very limited. What I would say, as I was trying to conclude in my remarks earlier, is that Canada has a role to play in NATO and all other multilateral organizations that we belong to, in making sure that questions of Russian activity in terms of violation of international law and violations of human rights are raised in all the forums possible, and that we speak with a united voice to Putin and his oligarchs. It will not be tolerated, and there will be consequences for them if they continue down this path. It is through that united voice in institutions like NATO and other multilateral institutions that I think we will have the greatest success in putting up resistance to what the Russian agenda appears to be. </ParaText>

I guess I would throw that question to perhaps our next speaker and ask where the government stands on acceding to the small Arms Trade Treaty.

              <ParaText id="4807712">Madam Chair, it is my privilege to stand to speak to this take-note debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807713"> First, I want to speak about the Edmonton Ukrainian Canadian community and how stalwart it has been across the country in standing up and giving support to their families overseas. It is absolutely incredible and it keeps pressure on us, getting us to speak out. I particularly want to mention Daria Luciw who is the former past president of the Edmonton UCC. She has been incredible in reaching out to me and telling me the views of the Edmonton UCC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807714">It is absolutely important that everyone in this place and across Canada takes the time and the opportunity available through the Ukrainian Canadian community to inform us about historic travesties that have gone on in Ukraine. I have had the privilege of participating in the Holodomor commemorations each year. There is a Holodomor travelling exposition, but there is also the <I>Bitter Harvest</I> film. I encourage people see it in the theatres. It talks about the crisis that Ukraine suffered in the past and continues to suffer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807715">A new play has been produced in Alberta, with the support of St. John's Institute, called <I>Blood of our Soil</I>. It is the most powerful presentation that I have seen of the long history of travesties that the people of Ukraine have suffered from the time of Stalin through Hitler and now under Putin. I hope the play will come to Ottawa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807716">As the <Affiliation DbId="229209" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> has advised, Ukrainians were early settlers to our Prairies and many of them descended from the train in Edmonton Strathcona, becoming tillers of the soil, and now holding places in all the governments of our country. It is to their credit. As a number of speakers here have said, it is important for us all to stand up for Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty, and speak out in support of Ukraine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807717">My colleagues and I support Operation Unifier continuing. Many have been waiting for this decision to be made and finally it has been. My guess is that two years probably will not be enough unless Mr. Putin backs off and takes away the support of what is going on in eastern Ukraine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807718">We celebrate and honour the commitment of Canadian troops, some of which include the Princess Patricia from Edmonton. I am very proud they have gone overseas again to share their skills and professionalism with the Ukrainian troops, many of which are completely untrained. I have met many of the young men and women who head off to the eastern edge of Ukraine with absolutely no training, putting their own lives at risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807719">However, as has been mentioned in the House, it is equally important not only that we give this direct assistance to build the army and the troops of Ukraine, but that we give increased support to the development of a democracy and restoration of the rule of law in the country. I spent a good deal of time over the four or five times I have visited in meeting with human rights advocates and with independent media that are struggling to be a voice for ordinary Canadians. Governments in the local area need our assistance in teaching them how they can work effectively with civil society. There are many young Ukrainians who are desperate to work hand in glove with the Ukrainian government in teaching them how to be more democratic. It is absolutely critical that we build that democracy if it is to have any hope of getting the confidence of the people in eastern Ukraine, that they can have confidence in their government to represent them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807720">I also want to mention a number of specific actions that could be taken. Disappointingly, the previous Conservative government gave short shrift to the imposition of sanctions. My colleagues in this place have continued to push to extend the sanctions so they are on par with the sanctions imposed by the U.S. and the EU, particularly Igor Sechin and Vladimir Yakunin, and to get rid of the various existing loopholes that allow Canadians to work with these discreditable entities in Russia, which help to foment and support this war.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807721">Again, we want to give thanks to the troops that are there and to let the people of Ukraine know we are here to support them and that we will hold the Liberal government accountable for delivering on the many promises that it makes.</ParaText>

Let me give a few examples. Would it not be wonderful if the government of the day stepped up and said that it would put the funds in to return Ukrainian interns to the country. That would be one specific thing that could be done that our friendship association would really appreciate. I cannot understate the value of that exercise. I had up to six interns that came to work with me in my office. They have all gone back and are contributing, working hand in glove with the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807725">Second, we need to give support to the independent media. We need to give a lot more support through CIDA to civil society.

I am also happy that we are debating this issue tonight, because I had the immense privilege of having seen our outstanding soldiers in action, working alongside our allies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807734">Support for Ukraine is important to Canadians and in particular the Ukrainian Canadian community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807735"> On Thursday and Friday of last week, I took part in town hall meeting with the Ukrainian Canadian communities in Regina and in Winnipeg, hosted by the Ukrainian Canadian Congress. Leaving Ottawa to meet and speak with Ukrainian Canadians was very important to me. They follow and feel more than anyone else in our country the horrible conflict to which Ukraine is being subjected. During these community meetings, I spoke at length about Operation Unifier and Canada's unwavering support for Ukraine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807736">I also had the opportunity to respond to a wide range of questions, and one point I made clear was that this was not a partisan issue. All parties in the House agree that Canada will always stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807737"> I heard first hand the gratitude that Ukrainian Canadians felt for the tremendous work of our troops on Operation Unifier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807738"> This time last year, I spent several days with our troops serving on Operation Unifier. I observed first hand the skills and determination our soldiers brought to this mission. I was extremely impressed with the level of training they were providing the Ukrainian armed forces. I was equally heartened by the passion the Ukrainian soldiers demonstrated in their training, and their appreciation for the experience and expertise our military trainers provided. All Canadians can be extremely proud of the work of our soldiers to defend our allies to help secure Ukraine, protect its sovereignty, and contribute to global stability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807739">Since the summer of 2015, 200 Canadian women and men stationed in Ukraine have trained more than 3,200 Ukrainian soldiers. The Canadian Armed Forces delivered over 90 training programs in that time. Their courses have covered everything from infantry to small team training to more specialized capabilities, such as explosive ordinance disposal, military policing, medical training, and modernized logistics. This invaluable training is building a knowledge base within the Ukrainian military, knowledge that is enabling the Ukrainian soldiers to take on greater responsibility for their country's sovereignty, security, and stability. The critical skills they have gained are strengthening the Ukrainian armed forces and reinforcing the strong bond that unites our countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807740">I conveyed the pride of Canadians in these achievements to our service members during a town hall while I was in Ukraine last year. I thanked them for their professionalism and determination to advance democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. That appreciation was echoed by the Ukrainian leaders I met during my visit, the mayor and governor of Lviv as well as the Ukrainian defence minister, General Poltorak.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807741">General Poltorak told the media, “It is common knowledge that true friendship is tested during hard times. Therefore are truly thankful to Canada for its support of our military from the very beginning of the conflict.” He continued by saying, “Canada has provided enormous assistance in training Ukrainian military and supplying equipment to strengthen our technical capacity...I am certain that advisory support which has been and continues to be provided by Canada is the best way to ensure that reforms will be successful.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807742">Everyone we met expressed their gratitude for Canada's help in training Ukrainian troops and building their country's capacity to defend its borders. Most of all, they thanked us for demonstrating unwavering support for Ukraine. Protecting Ukraine's sovereignty is fundamental, and it is vital to its identity, economic growth, and social stability. This sentiment has been repeated in this country by the Ukrainian ambassador to Canada, Mr. Shevchenko. He recently told the media, “Every day when your men and women train our officers and soldiers, it means saved lives.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807743">Our soldiers know better than anyone that sustaining this support is essential, especially now as Ukraine faces increased provocation from Russia.</ParaText>

Again, it is made up mostly of the members of the 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group, based in Edmonton, Alberta, many of whom I have personally served with, and their commanding officers as well. These highly skilled soldiers will carry on Canada's efforts to increase Ukraine's ability to maintain its sovereignty, security, and stability. In practical terms, this means a continuation of tactical soldier training. This involves individual weapons training, marksmanship, tactical movement, explosive threat recognition, communication, combat survival, and ethics training. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807748">We will continue to train Ukrainian soldiers on explosive ordnance and improvised explosive device disposal.

              <ParaText id="4807750">Canada's assistance to Ukraine includes the purchase and shipment of non-lethal military equipment. We have already delivered equipment such as tactical communications systems, a mobile field hospital, explosive ordnance disposal equipment, tactical medical kits, and night-vision goggles. Our next shipment will include first aid kits, military police training materials, and more explosive ordnance disposal equipment. This is vital equipment that will enhance the capability of the Ukrainian armed forces while at the same time reducing the financial burden on the Ukrainian government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807751">March 2017 marks three years since the Russian Federation's annexation of Crimea, an act condemned by countries the world over. Since 2014, the conflict has killed close to 10,000 people. Canada did not stand idly by when duty called. We joined Ukraine, the United States, and the United Kingdom under the Multinational Joint Commission. We demonstrated our reliability as a partner to our allies and our firm commitment to European security. Through Operation Unifier, we sent a clear signal of deterrence to Russia, and we also sent a strong message of solidarity and support to Ukraine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807752">Canada was the first country to recognize Ukraine's independence in 1991. All these years later, we continue to demonstrate global leadership by helping to address ongoing global threats. </ParaText>

Canada will remain at the forefront of the international community's response to Russian aggression in Ukraine, and I, for one, could not be prouder.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807754">Operation Unifier is just part of what we have done, and are doing, to support our allies and partners in eastern Europe.

              <ParaText id="4807759">I know that the minister visited the troops last year. He invited me to accompany him, but unfortunately, I was ill and was not able to be there. It is something I hope he and I can do again in the near future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807760">As everyone in this House always recognizes, our troops are second to none. Their skills and abilities, as the minister knows first hand, are easily transferrable, and our Canadian Armed Forces are always up to the job of helping those who want to better themselves and defend themselves, and in the case of Ukraine, who want to train to NATO standards. I thank the minister for extending this mission for the next two years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807761">Ukraine has been asking the minister, as well as the government, to sign the Canada-Ukraine defence co-operation agreement so that we can take this relationship even beyond what it is in Operation Unifier by expanding exchanges of officers and bringing their trainers here so they can get even more involved in the Canadian institution and the military culture we have here, which really is, in my opinion, the leader in the NATO nations. Something Ukraine, of course, aspires to is having NATO membership at some point in the future. Of course, they have to train to the standard. They have to make sure that they have that ability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807762">Will the minister commit to signing that agreement? Will he also take a serious look at providing lethal weapons to the Ukrainian military to defend Ukrainian territory, as the government has done with the Kurdish Peshmerga in fighting ISIS?</ParaText>

In fact, we were actually able to move ahead, but there were a few questions on the Ukrainian government side, which we were waiting for. They have been resolved. Regrettably, it is now just a matter of getting the timing right, with my counterparts, to move ahead with the defence co-operation agreement. It is just a matter of time before we do that. </ParaText>

The requests that come to the government come from the joint commission.</ParaText>

A lot of work needs to be done, we have to admit, but we are committed to doing it.</ParaText>

However, when I was honoured to visit with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and then again in September, one of the interesting things I heard over and over from Canadian officers was, number one, how highly motivated these Ukrainian soldiers were. Most were volunteers, but not volunteers in the sense that we imagine, as novices not familiar with the front. They were coming back from a front, where there was trench warfare and deadly artillery barrages. I heard from our Canadian officers that they were not just training; they were learning.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807777">Madam Chair, the relationship our men and women are building with the Ukrainian armed forces is unique. In fact, when I witnessed the training, I even asked if we needed to provide these small arms to have the training. When I was driving through the ranges, they were doing such realistic training. It was quite impressive. In fact, it actually brought me some déjà vu moments from my time in Afghanistan. However, it was the relationships that were being built.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807778">It was the troops on the ground that actually identified the lessons learned from the front, and one of them, in particular, was the need for first aid training. It is essential, when we look at the fighting on the ground. Those types of skills sometimes get left out. When that was identified by the Canadian troops, our Canadian leadership was able to set it up. I witnessed one of the teams that had finished training, the final scenario, the how-to, when someone is injured and goes to a casualty collection point. For their graduation they actually got the medical kits we provided.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807779">It also goes to show how deep the training on the ground actually evolves. The explosive ordnance training was truly impressive as well.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807787">Time is short in this take-note debate and we have heard the appropriate exchanges of compliments back and forth between members of all parties in the House who know through either service or experience exactly what is at stake in Ukraine, but I will cut to the chase.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807788">We in the opposition have long been worried that the Liberal government's commitment to the defence of Ukraine was half-hearted and fading. That would apply to not all Liberal MPs, as I have just said, but to the actions and attitudes of the government as a whole. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807789">Our concerns were realized two weeks ago, when the government, after ignoring appeals from Ukraine since last summer, finally announced an eleventh-hour bare-bones extension of Operation Unifier. This extension does not speak to the brutal new realities, the recent deadly surge in the Russian-backed war on Ukraine. The extension does not respond to Ukraine's request for an expansion of the Operation Unifier training mission. The extension does not answer the outgunned Ukrainians' appeal for defensive weapons and the restoration of satellite battlefield imagery. The extension does not address the long-overdue signing and implementation of the Canada-Ukraine defence co-operation agreement. The extension did not mention Ukraine's request for additional support for the widely recommended expansion of the OSCE monitor teams to report on violations of the Minsk agreement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807790">The Liberals have not spoken a word of increased humanitarian assistance to the thousands of newly displaced eastern Ukrainian civilians driven from their homes by the recent Russian-directed surge, adding to the more than a million and a half internally displaced men, women, and children and the three-year death toll of 10,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807791">Canada's commitment to the defence of Ukraine might not rate high on the Liberals' list of public opinion poll-driven priorities, but the Liberals, and in fact all Canadians, need to remember why Russia illegally invaded and still occupies the Ukrainian autonomous Republic of Crimea, why Russia invaded and still supports the euphemistically described rebellion in eastern Ukraine, and why the toll of death, displacement, and destruction continues there. It all comes down to democratic choice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807792">After the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, the people of Ukraine, along with the populations of many of the former oppressed Soviet republics, chose democracy and chose the west. The western democracies stepped up after Russia's bellicose response to Ukraine's revolution of dignity, the Russian invasion and occupation of Crimea, and Russia's invasion and arming of rebel separatists in eastern Ukraine. Western governments, including Canada's, imposed a range of sanctions on Russia, and in December 2014, Canada committed with the United States and other countries to provide coordinated training assistance through Joint Task Force Ukraine, with the Canadian element known as Operation Unifier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807793">As we have heard tonight, since deployment in the summer of 2015, the joint task force has trained more than 3,200 Ukrainian soldiers through more than 90 courses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807794">The Liberals claim their commitment remains strong, but these words often ring hollow. For example, just last December, we saw amazingly blatant duplicity when, on the same day that the Liberals sported traditional Ukrainian embroidered shirts, vyshyvankas, to brag in debate about Liberal support for Ukraine in the form of the free trade agreement negotiated by both our Conservative and Liberal governments, these same Liberals had the temerity to vote against Ukraine in a whipped vote against recognition of the historical deadly Surgunlik—the Soviet Tatar genocide—and Russia's current abuse and deportation of ethnic Tatars from the illegally occupied Ukrainian autonomous Republic of Crimea.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807795">That is why we in the official opposition are so disappointed in what I referred to earlier as the Liberals' eleventh-hour bare-bones extension of Operation Unifier. It falls short of our Conservative government's original commitment to Ukraine. It falls short of what Ukraine has requested and in fact appealed for. It falls short of Canada standing up strongly for a democratic Ukraine.</ParaText>

In fact it is true, and had I had more time I would have mentioned that the mistakes of one government with regard to names left off the list of sanctioned individuals should not be used as an excuse by the current government to continue to keep those names off the list. Igor Sechin is a prime example. As the brutal left-hand man of Vladimir Putin and the head of Russia's oil company, he has in fact, just in the last couple of months, managed to sell 20% of that company, despite U.S. and other sanctions, through a very dark series of negotiated deals. That is exactly why I would suggest that the names of Vladimir Yakunin and Igor Sechin be considered by the government today to be added to the list of those sanctioned Russian individuals.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807803">Madam Chair, I am pleased to rise this evening to debate this important issue. We are talking about Operation Unifier, but what exactly is that?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807804">Basically, this operation is a demonstration of strength and commitment, made to demonstrate Canada's commitment to Ukraine, an ally, in response to Russian aggression against Ukraine's territory. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807805">Following a coup d'état, Russia took control of Crimea. Putin's Russia continues to support troops fighting the Ukrainian government, in eastern Ukraine. Russia is supporting the chaos for its own personal gains. That is troubling. It is even more troubling to see the recent escalation of conflict in the region despite the Minsk agreement, signed in 2016. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, or OSCE, has identified over 3,099 violations of the agreement since it was signed. We cannot say that the situation is stable or is improving in any way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807806">When we were in power, Stephen Harper made a point of sending a clear message to the entire world regarding Canada's position on the Russian-backed rebel actions in Ukraine. The members will recall the G20 summit in Brisbane, Australia, in 2014 when Mr. Harper called on Mr. Putin to withdraw his troops from Ukraine. Mr. Harper never missed an opportunity to raise this issue with the Russian leader.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807807">The Ukrainian government had Canada's full support for ensuring the integrity of its territory. That is why we sent troops to help train the Ukrainian army in its fight against Russian-backed forces. We also collaborated on other levels. We sent materiel that the Ukrainian army needed in its fight: helmets, flak jackets, winter clothing, and night goggles. It is very important to remember that we also shared with the Ukrainian government geostrategic information gathered by our satelites. Through this surveillance we are able to see the trains delivering military equipment, ammunition, and fuel to the Donbass region where anti-government forces are operating.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807808">This evening, this take-note debate gives us the opportunity to discuss everyone's expectations of Operation Unifier. Since the Liberals came to power things have changed, and not always for the best, unfortunately. The Liberals announced that the operation would be extended, but they did so quietly, as though they were afraid to upset their Russian friends, as though they were ashamed to stand by Ukraine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807809">The Liberals and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> go around saying that Canada is back. Yes, Canada is back, but where? We are back to buddy-buddy relations with Putin's Russia, the aggressor in the current situation, and we should not forget that. The Liberals normalized relations with Russia without asking for anything in return that would bring to an end the despicable acts committed in Ukraine or other eastern European countries. <I /></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807810">Canada has also gone back to political window dressing. In announcing the extension of Operation Unifier, the Liberals eliminated an important element. In fact, on May 6, 2016, the Liberals stopped sharing information collected by our RADARSAT satellites. However, this information is crucial to the operations of the Ukrainian army. This type of information has saved the lives of many Ukrainians. Nevertheless, giving an ally the resources needed to control the advance of Russian-backed forces on its territory is not important for the Liberals, or at least it does not seem to be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807811">The Liberals are also refusing to sign a defence co-operation agreement with Ukraine, as the United Kingdom did. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807812">We must also be able to read Putin's game. He takes advantage of the instability all over the world for personal gain. While everyone is fighting against ISIS, the Russians continue to throw their weight around in Ukraine to increase their influence in the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807813">Considering the situation, we must help our ally, Ukraine, and ensure it has the means to fight foreign aggression. If aggression is on the rise, as it is now, our support must increase accordingly. We should regard an attack on the sovereignty of one of our allies as an attack on Canadian sovereignty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807814"> With this in mind, and this is the goal of tonight's debate, we call on the Liberals to do the following: first, immediately restore the practice of sharing intelligence gathered using our RADARSAT satellite with Ukrainian authorities; second, add Ukraine to the automatic firearms country control list and supply Ukrainian military forces with lethal defensive equipment; third, sign and implement the Canada-Ukraine defence co-operation agreement; fourth, increase the number of OSCE monitors to report on violations of the Minsk agreement; fifth, provide additional humanitarian assistance to support the 1.6 million internally displaced people in Ukraine, urge Russia to respect Ukraine’s sovereign territory and abide by all aspects of the Minsk agreement; and lastly, strengthen sanctions to hold corrupt foreign officials to account by implementing our Magnitsky legislation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807827">Tonight we have heard in detail about Operation Unifier in support of our ally Ukraine. However, in my limited time, I would like to provide an historical and geopolitical context as to how this effort is the hard military front line of a global hybrid war against liberal democracy launched by President Putin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807828">Over 25 years ago, the Soviet totalitarian empire collapsed, and leading political thinkers declared that liberal democracy and free markets had won the Cold War. They pronounced the end of history and a great peace dividend to come. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807829">Meanwhile, in East Germany, KGB officer Vladimir Putin watched the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the expulsion of the Soviet army and KGB bases from East Germany and the Warsaw Pact countries with personal fury. Later, President Putin called the collapse of the Soviet Union the greatest calamity of the 20th century, not the Holocaust, the Holodomor, nor the two world wars, which cost 100 million lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807830"> Inside the KGB mind of Putin, World War II was a great victory, with the Kremlin's armies stationed on East German borders less than 600 kilometres from France. For agent Putin, the loss of this empire was an historic humiliation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807831">During the February 23, 2014 closing ceremonies of the Sochi Olympic Games in Russia, the world watched the pageantry in the stadium, including the ominous coming together of a giant hammer and sickle. In the west, most did not notice. As the son and grandson of refugees who escaped the horrors of the Soviet Union, I felt a foreboding. I called family in Ukraine. The symbolism was not lost on anyone in central and eastern Europe. Four days later, on February 27, an unprepared west witnessed a geopolitical event in Crimea that changed our world order. Putin ordered the military invasion and annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula on the false pretext of Russian ethnic grievances. This had not been seen in Europe since the 1930s and Sudetenland. It was the first act in Putin's plan to dismember and collapse the Ukrainian state, its revolution of dignity and democracy. This Russian military annexation violated the letter and spirit of every post-World War II treaty and agreement guaranteeing the integrity of international borders. Our rules-based international order, which has largely prevented territorial wars of expansion, has been jeopardized. Today no small state bordering Russia can feel secure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807832">Soon after the Russian invasion and annexation of Crimea, and the west's initially confused response, Russia invaded Donbass. Today, three years hence, the result is that there are over 10,000 dead, approximately two million internally displaced, and a frozen hot conflict within Europe. Weekly, we receive reports of more Russian tanks and artillery systems being moved into Ukraine. Daily, we read the front-line casualty figures. In fact, in the last 24 hours, four Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in action. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807833">Within Crimea and occupied Donbass, extra-judicial arrests are commonplace, those incarcerated are tortured, and summary executions are frequent. Crimea's indigenous people, the Crimean Tatars, are particularly targeted. Their Mejlis, mosques, and schools are raided and closed, their leaders arrested or disappeared.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807834"> As part of Putin's hybrid global war against liberal democratic values and governments, Russian hydrocarbon billions corrupts political and corporate elites in the west, such as former German Chancellor Schröder and former U.S. security chief Michael Flynn. Far right nativist parties and movements are financed, such as Le Pen's National Front, political elections are sabotaged, the U.S. presidential election is hacked, and there is Montenegro's attempted <I>coup d'état</I>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807835"> However, in this amorphous borderless global hybrid war, there is a hard military front line. It stretches from the Baltic to the Black Sea. With our U.S., British, and German allies, we have placed soldiers on Russia's borders with the Baltic states and Poland. In the Black Sea, we have placed a frigate and deployed air force personnel to train with Romania's air force. On this hard military front line, there is an active regional war in Donbass. There the Kremlin is testing the resolve of the democratic west. Will the west sacrifice Ukraine in the hope of satisfying Russian revanchist neo-imperialism in the manner that Czechoslovakia was sacrificed by the west after the invasion of Sudetenland? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807836">Canada has made it clear that there will be no appeasement. While we diplomatically engage Russia, sanctions will continue, and the Canadian military will continue to deploy into Ukraine to help train and equip the Ukrainians as they head to the front lines. With Operation Unifier, we stand shoulder to shoulder with our ally Ukraine in the face of Russia's war against Ukraine, and we are containing Putin's—</ParaText>

However, my colleague's remarks would seem to be supporting the feeling on this side of the House that we should be responding with much more to the request of the government of Ukraine.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807841">Madam Chair, in fact, there is no light between the previous government's positions when it comes to Ukraine and the current government's position. What we have seen on this file is a realization in the House of Commons in Canada's Parliament, by all parties, that Ukraine needs to be supported. The NDP, the Greens, the Bloc, the Conservatives, and the Liberals have come together, whether it is the free trade agreement or when it comes to Operation Unifier. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807842">When it comes to the second point with regard to how we can expand on this, our government has the front line of this war, the hard front military line that runs from the Baltic down to the Black Sea. We have engaged in a new mission. We have taken the lead in Latvia. We are on the front line with the Russian border when it comes to Latvia. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807843">We have also instituted the Ukrainian Defence Reform Advisory Board, and put Jill Sinclair, a former assistant deputy minister of defence, on this board to help Ukraine as it works toward this ambitious goal to be NATO compliant by 2020. That is a new effort. We are helping Ukraine to become NATO compliant. We are also working on making sure that the whole front line is covered.

It is a small minority that have pushed that particular political agenda. It does not have broad support among the people of Ukraine, nor does it have the broad political support.

              <ParaText id="4807849">Madam Chair, I am proud to add my voice to those we have already heard on this important topic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807850">I have had the fortunate experience to visit Ukraine three times: first, with my family, as our place of heritage on my maternal and paternal sides; second, as a business owner and scientist; and finally, last November, as Canada's minister of labour, to provide assistance in workplace safety, especially in the heavy industrial sector of mineral exploration. In addition, I took a tour of Chernobyl, the world's largest single nuclear disaster. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807851">We are continuing to build our connections with Ukraine, not only military ones, but also economic and cultural ones. Today, we are talking about that military stand with the renewal of Operation Unifier. Very significantly on the other front is the fact that we have signed the Canada-Ukraine free trade agreement. It represents an important milestone in the Canada-Ukraine relationship and will bring greater prosperity, economic security, and economic independence to the Ukrainian people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807852">It has been three years since Russia's illegal annexation and invasion of Crimea. Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity were violated. We were right to condemn it then, and we are right to continue to condemn it now. The occupation has led to distress, economic instability, and severe suppression of human rights. Canada has called on Russia to reverse this illegal and immoral decision. Ukrainians are tough and steadfast in their desire for a free, independent, democratic country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807853"> My grandfathers and father emigrated from the villages of Senkiw and Bridok in Ukraine, and settled in southern Manitoba, in Arbakka and a little village called Senkiw after the one in the homeland with the first wave in 1896. For me as a second generation Canadian, my connection to Ukraine is strong. There are over 1.25 million Canadians who, like me, call themselves Ukrainian Canadians. We recognize the importance of continuing to partner with Ukraine and keeping our connection to the homeland alive generations down the road. This is why it gives me a great deal of pride to have had the opportunity to participate in sending 10 Canadian ambulances, five from my home province of Manitoba, to Ukraine. This was thanks to the Ukrainian Canadian Congress whose hard work keeps the connection between our two countries alive. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807854">I must thank John Holuk and Myroslava Pidhirnyj of the UCC whose hard work brought the ambulances and medical kits to the people who need it most at the front line and in health service centres. These ambulances are a reminder that Ukrainians are still working hard to reach the same freedoms and standard of living that we enjoy in Canada, but they cannot do it alone. Sometimes they need ambulances; other times they need training and supplies. This is why we are proud to continue Operation Unifier standing at the forefront of the international community's response to the crisis. Operation Unifier gives us the chance to partner our military expertise, delivering military training and capacity building. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807855">Canada's continued engagement in Ukraine demonstrates our reliability as a defence partner and our commitment to European security while we are enabling Ukrainian forces to defend their country's sovereignty and contribute to regional international stability.

If we look at Chernobyl and the disaster left for Ukraine to manage and ensure the leakage is contained, our contribution has been significant. Canada's contribution has been in engineering and science and monitoring. We also have an opportunity every year to see a group of young Ukrainian interns come to the House, to our Parliament. Many of us have taken on those young interns, and they have gone on to become activists back at home calling for democracy. </ParaText>

I understand that the government took full credit for $700 million of humanitarian assistance in aid and loans that have been provided to Ukraine. I would point out that some 600 million of those dollars were provided by the previous Conservative government. I just offer her this opportunity to correct the record to lay out that this has been bipartisan, and indeed, there has been all-party support for Ukraine. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807863">I would ask her to respond to the Ukrainian Canadian community's questions in Winnipeg of why the government is not supplying lethal weapons to the Ukrainian military to defend themselves from this Russian aggression. </ParaText>

That party invested and stood as a strong partner with Ukraine. The record shows that, and I am very proud to be on this side of the House continuing the very strong support in that partnership. There could be no doubt that both parties have been strong and true partners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807865">The situation now with a very aggressive and active war front on the Donetsk front is very troubling. There have been 10,000 wounded and thousands of soldiers' deaths. The capacity to handle an active front like that with such a large and mobilized opposition is troubling. Is it better to use words or military weapons? Given this circumstance, given what we have to play along the whole Russian front requires very complicated and delicate diplomatic manoeuvring. It is very important that we be very cautious when we look at how we handle the situation. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807867"> Canada and Ukraine share a special relationship. The Ukrainian diaspora in Canada is the largest outside Ukraine with more than 1.3 million Canadians claiming some connection to Ukraine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807868">Russia began its invasion of Ukraine in 2014, including the illegal annexation of Crimea on March 21, 2014, three years ago tomorrow. Estimates from different sources place the combined military and civilian casualty rate at close to 50,000. Let there be no misunderstanding that the conflict is ongoing and it can only go from bad to worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807869">In April 2015, Prime Minister Harper, on behalf of Canada, responded to the deteriorating situation by announcing Canada would deploy approximately 200 Canadian Armed Forces personnel to Ukraine until March 31, 2017. For nearly two years, Canadian troops have been providing training in explosive ordnance disposal, flight safety, logistics system modernization, military policing, and medical training.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807870">After repeated delays and requests from Ukraine's president, Canada has finally extended the mission to Ukraine until March 2019. As far as Canada's participation with this mission is concerned, my first concern has been and always will be for our Canadian soldiers and their families. This is a hot zone. Even before the announcement that Canada was extending the Ukraine mission, Petawawa was already preparing for a summer deployment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807871">On March 9, the Conservative Party, after months of giving the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> the opportunity to do the right thing, brought to the attention of Canadians the most recent example of how the Liberal Party devalues the dangers inherent in missions like the one we are debating today. The decision to claw back the danger pay of soldiers on the front line in the war against international terrorism has soldiers asking me if their pay will be cut by not receiving the proper recognition of being in a hot zone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807872"> Soldiers remember being sent to Afghanistan without the proper uniforms. Soldiers remember their comrades from the conflict in Afghanistan who were killed or injured by a roadside bomb because the Liberal Party played politics with air support when it cancelled the helicopter contract. In fact, history repeats itself with the same type of politics being played with the fighter jet replacement. Without the proper strategic airlift to get soldiers off the roads, lives were needlessly sacrificed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807873">Soldiers are asking what else the Liberals will take away besides their danger pay. What happens when the injured soldier comes home?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807874">I brought the case of Warrant Officer Roger Perreault to the floor of the House. His treatment has been nothing short of scandalous. What about the Roger Perreaults and other soldiers like him who are waiting to receive the critical injury benefits they so deserve? To the soldiers and veterans who are watching this debate, I want them to know I have their back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807875">As a veteran Conservative member of the Standing Committee on National Defence, I am pleased to confirm that through the defence committee, I have been pushing the government to accept the recommendations of the National Defence and Canadian Armed Forces ombudsman, Gary Walbourne, in the report presented last fall to the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>, “Simplifying the Service Delivery Model for Medically Releasing Members of the Canadian Armed Forces”. Specifically, soldiers need to know that if they are injured and no longer meet the universality of service requirement, the support is there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807876">Of the many problems that I am called upon to intervene in regarding service in the Canadian Armed Forces, the issues surrounding medical release are the most frustrating, both for releasing soldiers and their families. The need to provide the soldier a seamless transition has become an issue of crisis proportion since Prime Minister Chrétien first committed Canada to the mission in Afghanistan. It is time to move on and do what is right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807877">The first reform that must take place is to ensure no currently serving member of the Canadian Armed Forces is medically released without all services and benefits in place. Each year approximately 1,500 members of the Canadian Armed Forces are released due to illness or injury, of which about 600 are directly related to military service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807878">Once released from the Canadian Armed Forces, the soldier becomes the responsibility of Veterans Affairs Canada. Ill and injured members must prove to Veterans Affairs Canada their illness or injury was attributable to or aggravated by their military service. While the Canadian Armed Forces have all the medical and personnel information needed to support a claim, the information systems between the departments are completely independent of one another. Medically releasing soldiers are required to obtain medical and service documents from the Department of National Defence, and then to plead their case to Veterans Affairs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807879">Once again, I am calling on the government to implement the recommendations given in the report from the military ombudsman.</ParaText>

She has always fought to ensure that they are well represented at committee and in the House; that their care, needs, and benefits are, first and foremost, at the forefront of our debates here; and that they get the proper equipment and kit to do the jobs they are so often called upon to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807881">In the situation in Ukraine, there are over 200 members of the Canadian Armed Forces training with Ukrainian military members. They are somewhat removed from harm's way, but at the same time, the situation over there is fluid. Russia has a very advanced military and can move over a lot of territory very quickly.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807883">Madam Chair, it is really important to have a seamless transition so that when military personnel are injured, be it in training at home or in helping in training train overseas, they know that if something happens to them, they will be taken care of, and if they cannot meet the universality of service, they will have the proper pension in place without having to fight another fight for it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807884">My colleague mentioned earlier what is needed over there. In June 2014, there was a Canadian NATO Parliamentary Association meeting in Vilnius. Soldiers from the front were parliamentarians. Olekas was leading the delegation. He was on crutches, because he had been injured. I still have his list today, and it sounds like he is still asking for more of the same. He says they do not need advice. What they need are helmets and body armour. Our troops have the wonderful Pacific Safety Products fragmentation protective vests, but they are using pieces of tin. I hope we will provide them with what is needed where we can.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807887">Madam Chair, ongoing support is very important. At that parliamentary association meeting in Vilnius in 2014, the Lithuanians were commemorating their 25 years of independence, and they unveiled a museum. It showed different depictions of what they went through when they were fighting for their independence, but unlike the history itself, they wanted to show solidarity with Ukraine. For every battle they went through for their independence, they showed what Ukraine was going through at that time. It was just a few short months before that Putin's Russian forces had invaded Crimea. The stark memory I have is of the Lithuanians' body armour. They were two flat pieces of tin held together at the shoulders with men's pants belts. That is what they were using for body armour.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4807889">Madam Chair, I will start my speech by giving a deep note of thanks and appreciation to the men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces who are participating in this mission and other missions abroad. Oftentimes we do not take enough time to appreciate the sacrifice of these people and their families in upholding the law and the Canadian vision of democracy and peace around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807890"> I am disappointed that the first debate the Liberals have initiated in the House of Commons is on a mission that the Conservatives put forward. The Liberals are really not doing anything different with respect to this mission and have declined to start debate on sending our men and women in the armed forces into harm's way on a peacekeeping mission, which for all intents and purposes is just a bid to buy a seat on the UN Security Council. They should be ashamed of that, given the UN's complete lack of any sort of response to the crisis in Syria. The Liberals are exceptionally misguided in their approach to defence and foreign policy in this regard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807891">None the less, this debate gives me an opportunity to highlight the fact that it was our Conservative government that took leadership in starting Operation Unifier. We were one of the first voices in the world to firmly and strongly stand against the illegal occupation of Crimea and to stand with the people of Ukraine, especially in light of the exceptional contributions that the people of Ukraine have made to Canada's history. As an Alberta MP, whenever I have an opportunity to talk about the contribution of the Ukrainian community in Alberta, I always choose to do so, and I am acknowledging that today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807892">In the brief time I have, I would like to speak about my exceptional disappointment in this self-congratulatory exercise that the Liberals are engaging in tonight. They have done little to nothing to address the issue of internally displaced people in Ukraine. I do have to give credit to my colleague who is the chair of the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration. He went against his party to a certain extent and forced a study on internally displaced people around the world and how the government would respond to that. In that committee study, we heard testimony, which frankly made vomit rise in my mouth, about the situation facing over 1.2 million people in Ukraine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807893">If members have not had a chance to read the recommendations in the report that came out last summer, I would encourage them to read the testimony. The human rights violations and abuses against internally displaced people in Ukraine should light the world on fire. The Liberal government has done nothing on the internally displaced persons issue to date in spite of the Ukrainian community in Canada asking for action. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807894">The Liberal <Affiliation DbId="229219" Type="4">immigration minister</Affiliation> stands in the House of Commons and talks about how the Liberals are bringing in tens of thousands of refugees. However, I have not once heard about the prioritization of internally displaced persons from Ukraine. It is wrong for the Liberals to stand in the House of Commons and force a take-note debate on this issue without talking about how IDPs are going to be supported. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807895">There has been a lot of discussion about the amount of aid going from Canada to assist Ukraine. Before my Liberal colleagues get up and offer talking points in this regard, I would note and pre-empt them by saying that most of that money was announced under the previous Conservative government. There has been little to no additional support for Ukraine announced in spite of what we expect to be an unprecedented level of deficit to be presented in the federal budget this year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807896">With my remaining time, I would draw the attention of my colleagues to the statement made by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="214192" Type="2">Thornhill</Affiliation> on some of the things the Liberal government should be doing to support this initiative, including supporting and implementing Magnitsky legislation. I have heard nothing from the Liberal government indicating that it wants to support this. This is a huge call from the Ukrainian community in Canada and around the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807897">A number of recommendations from the Ukrainian Canadian Congress have not been addressed by the Liberal government to date. If the Liberals have the audacity to stand in the House of Commons and pat themselves on the back, I wish they would do so by offering something new.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807910">Mr. Chair, I wish to inform you that I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="214201" Type="2">Kanata—Carleton</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807911">I am pleased to speak to the House today about extending our military contribution in Ukraine, especially Canadian development co-operation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807912">As the first western country to recognize Ukraine in 1991, Canada was among the first international donors to provide significant development aid to this country. Independent evaluations have proven many times that Canada has a comparative advantage thanks to the knowledge, language skills, and expertise of the Ukrainian Canadian community. In addition, Canada has an ability to promote innovation and to adapt to a political and socio-economic context that is constantly evolving.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807913">When Ukrainian citizens took charge of the future of their country with the revolution of dignity in 2013, they argued in favour of democratic reforms and integrating with Europe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807914">Ukraine, which was facing a huge political crisis, the risk of economic collapse, and aggression from the east, seized the opportunity to determine its own future. Canada was among the first donors to increase its support to Ukraine in order to help that country defend its territorial integrity, stabilize its economy, and lay the foundations for long-term development in terms of independence, democracy, and prosperity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807915">Since January 2014, Canada has contributed approximately $700 million in technical and financial assistance to strengthen security, deliver critical humanitarian support, stabilize the economy, and support Ukraine's efforts to implement profound and comprehensive democratic and economic reforms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807916">Canada is very concerned about the individuals who have been affected by the conflict in eastern Ukraine and by the increased risk of poverty. We are committed to delivering effective humanitarian assistance in a timely manner, in accordance with the humanitarian principle of impartiality, humanity, neutrality, and independence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807917">The Ukrainian government has reported nearly 1.7 million internally displaced people. Those individuals need support, especially since over 73% of those displaced people consist of single-mother families. Canada's humanitarian response involves meeting the needs of the most vulnerable, particularly the specific needs of women and girls. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807918">Since the beginning of the crisis, through our humanitarian partners, Canada has provided more than $27 million in humanitarian assistance to help millions of vulnerable people who are directly affected by this armed conflict. This assistance includes several components including basic health services, food aid, protection, shelter, and other essential support measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807919">Canada also plays a key role by providing the Ukrainian government support in developing policies to help it respond to this conflict. To deal with this external aggression, Ukraine must adopt reconstruction and peacekeeping measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807920">The need for humanitarian assistance remains high. This need is exacerbated by the fact that the country does not have control over a significant part of its territory and millions of people are trapped, with nowhere to go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807921">From an economic standpoint, Ukraine posted 2% growth in 2016, which is quite impressive given the tough recession the country has gone through over the past two years. Ukraine has also made unprecedented efforts to reform its public administration and its security and justice sector, while promoting decentralization. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807922">Ukraine has significantly strengthened its anti-corruption measures by creating some key institutions and increasing transparency especially in its public procurement systems. In terms of macroeconomics, Canada has helped Ukraine avoid economic disaster by strengthening the International Monetary Fund's extended credit facility and providing long-term technical support to the National Bank of Ukraine and to the department.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807923">I would be pleased to take any questions about other aspects or key points.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807937">To assist Ukraine in driving its ambitious reform efforts forward, Canada helped the Government of Ukraine develop key reform plans, following the revolution of dignity, including constitutional, electoral, judicial, social policy, and health plans, under the rubric of the multinational joint commission. In addition, Canada deployed 80 technical experts to key government ministries to support the implementation of these reforms, and is continuing to provide this technical assistance as specific needs are identified.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807938"> For example, recognizing the risk that corruption poses to the overall progress of reforms, economic growth, and security in the country, Canada played a key role in advancing political finance legislation, which contributed to the establishment of the national agency for the prevention of corruption and the national anti-corruption bureau of Ukraine, two critical anti-corruption institutions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807939">Now, let us talk about media. Given the critical importance of independent and quality media for a successful democratic society, Canada supported the development of investigative journalism, which has already resulted in the dismissal of a dozen high-level bureaucrats involved in cases of alleged corruption. We also continue to build the capacity of media to resolve important policy issues, particularly related to Ukraine's conflict-affected population, promoting social cohesion, and tolerance. Canada has also helped institutionalize gender policies in targeted media outlets, which directly correlates to 100% of content being free of gender stereotypes and discrimination. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807940">Having witnessed a significant surge in women's activism and civic movement during the revolution of dignity and women's response to the conflict in the east, including in volunteer combat roles, Canada emphasizes the importance of gender equality and women's empowerment for Ukraine's economic and social development. For instance, a past report from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in Europe listed Canada as the fourth largest donor to gender equality and women's empowerment, with Ukraine being one of the top 10 recipients of Canada's gender equality focused aid.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807941"> Canada has also strengthened women's political participation by improving the electoral environment and political party development, including through the women's leadership academy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807942">More than 65% of the participants trained by Canada applied its newly acquired knowledge during the October 2015 local elections, by running for local office or by working on local election campaigns. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807943">Canada also promotes the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises, including through the Canada-Ukraine free trade agreement, ratified by the Ukrainian parliament in March of 2017. Canada's development assistance strengthens the capacity of small and medium-sized enterprises in Ukraine to be able to take advantage of increased trade flows between Canada and Ukraine, and the European Union. Small and medium-sized enterprises were severely affected by the war with Russia. They are less resilient than larger companies and therefore are in need of assistance to transition to the European and Canadian markets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807944">With Ukraine being called the bread basket of Europe, with its rich black soils, Canada provides significant support to introduce innovative, profitable, and environmentally sustainable practices to the agricultural sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807945"> Undertaking a comprehensive, sector-wide approach, Canada supported the development of the draft law on agricultural co-operatives and established a new master's program on co-operative management at two Ukrainian universities. For the first time, two regional unions of agriculture service co-operatives were created, improving the competitiveness of over 5,000 small-scale farmers. With the agricultural sector being dominated by men, Canada also specifically targeted and supported women-led farms, creating over 300 women-led businesses. We will continue to ensure that the empowerment of women and girls remains a key component in the support we provide.</ParaText>

At the start of the Russian invasion, Ukraine was relatively weak, but since then, Ukrainians of all ethnic, religious, and linguistic backgrounds, the proud and generous Ukrainian diaspora, and the community of free, peace-loving nations have rallied together to help strengthen Ukrainian institutions and to give Ukraine the fighting capacity to resist foreign occupation and foreign-engineered disorder.</ParaText>

We do not have unlimited capacity, but if we are to be a leader in the world, then we must put our money where our mouth is. We must show that right makes might and play a role in delivering that might.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807969"> The government has spoken in the past about having a leaner military. In this time of global danger and uncertainty, the world needs more Canada, not less. We cannot be there for Ukraine and for our other allies over the long term unless we are making investments in our military today that will ensure that we have the capacity to play a role over the long term. We cannot make commitments if we are not prepared to make commitments. I hope that Wednesday's budget will see the government change course and start to invest in the defence of Canada and Canadian values.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807970"> Now, in the opposition, we will always take a responsible approach to these issues, standing four-square behind Ukraine and behind our military, supporting the government when it is doing the right thing and challenging it to do more. Let me be clear, as well, as the grandson of a Holocaust survivor and as a member of the opposition, that we will never countenance Putin's efforts to use disinformation to discredit Canadian politicians, even if they happen to be members of a different political party. In this country, we do not subject each other to genealogical purity tests. We debate ideas. This kind of thing will not work in Canada; it will, if anything, serve to deepen our resolve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807971"> As an opposition, we ask the government to do more. Every time I have spoken about Ukraine in this House, I have made the same three points about what the government needs to do to improve. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807976">Mr. Chair, the hon. member mentioned Magnitsky sanctions. Sanctions have been noted a number of times during this evening's debate, as have the oligarch kleptocrats Sechin and Yakunin, who are in President Putin's inner circle. Why is it that they were on the sanctions list in Europe, on the U.S. sanctions list, but at the last minute, former minister Baird removed those two names from the sanctions list? We know that a former staffer worked as a lobbyist or was hired after his term in the former minister's office. He was hired as a lobbyist by a Russian company associated with these oligarchs. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807978">Mr. Chair, I would be happy to comment on this, because the current government has been in place for a year and a half now and the individuals the member mentioned have yet to be added to the sanctions list. I would throw it back to the hon. member. If he is of the view that these individuals need to be on the list, I would encourage him to bring that case to members on his own front bench. I know they could do better at listening to the back benches in general, and perhaps they will this time around.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807979">The reality is that, of course, throughout the international community, sanctions are coordinated in order to achieve the maximal impact on Russia with the least possible economic impact on the countries imposing those sanctions. Does that mean they were necessarily done perfectly? No, but this is the way in which the sanctions are done. Again, it is in a coordinated way for maximal impact on Russia. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807980">However, none of this actually addresses what I spoke about, which was Magnitsky sanctions. This is something that all parties had committed to before the election and which the government seemed to be backing away from, at least under the last foreign affairs minister. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4807981">Maybe we will see the Liberals revisit this issue. I hope we do. Magnitsky sanctions are an important way of specifically sanctioning human rights abusers and addressing those human rights issues. This is something that is important to the Ukrainian community, because it addresses human rights inside Russia where these problems clearly are emanating from. </ParaText>

It was a shocking violation of what we understood to be a fundamental principle of our international order that borders are not to be changed by force. Vladimir Putin followed this illegal act with another assault on Ukraine in the Donbass region. This region's conflict continues to claim lives and drive people from their homes. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4807984">Two weeks ago, the Liberal government announced that it was extending Operation Unifier, Canada's military training mission to Ukraine. For nearly two years, about 200 Canadian Armed Forces members have been deployed to western Ukraine. They have provided training in explosive ordnance disposal, flight safety, logistics system modernization, military policing, and medical training. That mission would have expired on March 31, but the government's announcement to extend the mission came at the very last minute. That delay was an act of disrespect, I believe.</ParaText>

In the past three years Ukrainians have proven themselves to be some of the fiercest defenders of the values all of us say we support. They are fighting for their lives, their families, their hometowns, their liberty. They want to be living in a free country that respects the fundamental human rights of every man and woman. As a friend and ally, Canada has a moral duty to stand with them in their fight. Ukraine should always be able to depend on us.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4808002">I am proud to the rise in the House this evening to speak in support of Operation Unifier, which was announced last week by the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="229209" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808003"> I rise today on behalf of my constituents in Parkdale—High Park in support of this important mission. The constituents in my riding are engaged, informed, and compassionate people. I take pride in the fact that Parkdale—High Park is home to thousands of Ukrainian Canadians. My constituents understand that Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and military offensive in the Donbass in eastern Ukraine is unacceptable. We as a government understand this as well. That is why the Canadian government is taking action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808004">Through Operation Unifier, we are providing support to Ukrainian forces through capacity-building and military training. Sharing Canadian knowledge and expertise is crucial to fully supporting Ukraine in its efforts to maintain its sovereignty, its security, and its territorial integrity against unjustified aggression at the hands of invading Russian forces in Crimea and the Donbass. Every single day, the sons, daughters, mothers, and fathers of Ukrainian Canadians are either being wounded or killed. As Ukraine's closest friend and ally, we as Canadians must prepare the Ukrainian people to properly defend themselves and reduce these casualties. That is why Canada is committing to capacity-building and military training through Operation Unifier. Through this operation, we are sending a clear message to Ukrainians here and around the world that we as a government will stand shoulder to shoulder in solidarity with Ukraine, and will continue to work to promote Ukraine's sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity. That is a message that is not only for the Ukrainian diaspora in my riding of Parkdale—High Park or around the rest of Canada, it is also a clear message of deterrence to Russian, whose actions have destabilized the region and continue to pose a security threat to our allies in Europe. Make no mistake, Russian aggression presents an existential threat to Ukraine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808005">Operation Unifier complements other Canadian efforts already under way to combat Russian expansionism. This past July, in 2016, at the Warsaw Summit, NATO members, including Canada, agreed to deploy military forces to the Baltic states and Poland beginning in January of this year under Operation Reassurance. These efforts are meant to deter further Russian aggression like what we have seen in Crimea and the Donbass. Together with our allies, we have stood up and demonstrated leadership in the fight against Russian aggression. The U.K. has deployed in Estonia, Germany in Lithuania, and the United States in Poland, while our Canadian brave men and women in uniform are deploying in Latvia. The nature and magnitude of this concerted NATO response has sent a clear signal to Moscow that we are not simply using rhetoric to counter Russian aggression, we are coupling our words with concrete actions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808006">Our support of Ukraine is interwoven with the rich Ukrainian heritage in this country. In my role as the parliamentary secretary for multiculturalism, I am keenly aware of the rich contributions that Ukrainians have made to Canada's history and its development. The first members of the Ukrainian diaspora to settle in Ontario and western Canada came to this country 126 years ago. In that period, Ukrainian traditions have become Canadian traditions, such as wearing a vyshyvanka at the Bloor West Village Toronto Ukrainian Festival in my riding. I was also honoured to have the ability to congratulate the Ukrainian Canadian Congress on the launch of its Canada 150th program entitled youth engaging youth, which is funded by our government. This project will celebrate diversity and promote that shared heritage through youth engagement between, among others, Ukrainian Canadian youth and young people who are indigenous. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808007">Our government has also tabled legislation in support of Canada-Ukraine free trade, an agreement that was signed by both nations in Kiev on July 11, 2016. I spoke in strong support of this agreement in this House because its benefits to our economies are clear. When that trade agreement comes into effect, it will eliminate the duties and tariffs on both sides of the economic ledger. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808008">Canada has always been a close ally and friend to Ukraine. We were the first western nation to recognize Ukraine's independence on December 2, 1991. We will continue to stand with Ukraine as a strong global partner, especially at this critical time when Ukraine needs the support of its allies to combat Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and continued aggression in the Donbass. Canada's Operation Unifier will provide that much-needed support. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4808026">Mr. Chair, I am proud to rise today to speak in favour of our government's extension of Operation Unifier. In the face of ongoing Russian military aggression and illegal occupation, our government remains steadfast in Canada's commitment to the Ukrainian people. Our special relationship with Ukraine is bolstered by a shared vision, one in which the Ukrainian people have succeeded in their work to build a more secure, stable, and prosperous country, and one in which Ukraine is free from Russian aggression. We have been among the strongest international supporters of Ukraine's efforts to restore stability and to implement democratic and economic reforms. Canada was also one of the first countries to impose sanctions on the Russian government after its illegal invasion and annexation of Crimea in 2014. The current government has continued to uphold this tough stance on Russia when it expanded sanctions against specific Russian officials. These officials include the so-called elected representatives to the Duma from Crimea, individuals who have absolutely no business being there. Furthermore, since January 2014, the Government of Canada has announced over $700 million in assistance to Ukraine. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808027">This effort to support Ukraine through this important period of transition is a non-partisan commitment, and I would like to take a moment to thank the previous government for its work on this very important file. As we work to support Ukraine, military assistance will remain a key component of our country's commitment to Ukraine across development, security, democracy, and humanitarian aid.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808028"> For those who may not be familiar with Operation Unifier, I would like to take a moment to talk about what Canada's contribution to military aid in Ukraine looks like. Operation Unifier is a multinational joint support mission, which currently includes approximately 200 Canadian Armed Forces personnel. Canada's main focus is on tactical soldier training. As of December 2016, the Canadian Armed Forces has provided more than 3,200 training opportunities to UAF soldiers and officers on Operation Unifier. Many of the Canadians deployed are veterans of the war in Afghanistan and are now involved in training UAF personnel, including some coming directly from the front line in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbass. The impact of the training efforts of these Canadian soldiers has been commendable, and I would like to take a moment to recognize and thank these soldiers who are hard at work for Canada, helping to build a better, more stable, and more secure world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808029">There are those who would dismiss the notion that Canada is undertaking a training role, as if that role were unimportant. I would like to draw down into one specific training element that our forces will be assisting with. Canadian forces will be training Ukrainian forces on explosive ordinance disposal and improvised explosive device disposal training. This might seem like a small thing to some, but it is a critically important skill. Let me provide some context. According to the 2016 annual report from the <I>Landmine Monitor</I>, Ukrainian government forces claim that they are forced to deal with the deployment of land mines and other illegal devices in Ukraine. Someone other than the Ukrainian government is deploying land mines in Ukrainian territory. Let me quote from the report: </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808030">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">In November 2015, an officer from the General Staff informed soldiers that separatist NSAGs were using landmines attached to fish hooks and fishing lines to snag the clothing of soldiers as they moved through wooded areas, thereby detonating nearby mines.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808031">Numerous reports from the past few years have indicated that land mines and other illegal devices have had devastating consequences upon the civilian population in Ukraine as well. In March 2015, it was reported that over the previous year at least 42 children had been killed and 109 more were injured by mines in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine alone. Given Canada's proud history of supporting the eradication of land mines, it is extremely fitting and important that we engage in these kinds of training activities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4808035"> In several interactions with representatives of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the OSCE, they were appealing, almost begging, for more funds to allow not only monitoring on both sides of the line of contact in eastern Ukraine, but to expand their operations along the Russian border to better monitor what Russia is sending into eastern Ukraine in the way of fuel, armaments, and men. Would he advise his Liberal government that perhaps it is time to step up and provide some additional funding to the OSCE to carry out these important monitoring operations?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4808037">One of the things the OSCE representatives also mentioned during that trip was the difficulty they were having in that region. As I mentioned in my remarks, one of the reasons they were having difficulties was the amount of land mines there. Because of our participation in sending ordinance equipment to help with the situation in the region, especially in Donbass, Canada is stepping up in a very constructive way to provide security on the ground to ensure aid can be deployed in a reasonable manner. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4808038">Mr. Chair, we have been discussing Operation UNIFIER for more than three hours. The government has not yet brought anything new to the table. It merely repeats what was put in place from the beginning of the mission by the Conservative government. The $600 million or $700 million was allocated by the former government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808039">On February 23, my colleagues, the Conservative opposition critics for national defence and foreign affairs, issued a statement with eight very legitimate demands about strengthening Operation UNIFIER. We have been discussing them for three hours and presenting various elements. However, the members opposite have provided no response other than their government will continue with the same mission without an additional force.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808040">Could my colleague tell me what he thinks of the Conservative opposition's demands? Is the call to again provide RADARSAT imagery useless? I heard one member say that Ukraine is saying that it is totally useless even though we know that that is not true. For example, does he agree that we should toughen our stance on the Minsk agreement because we know that there have been 3,099 violations? I want to know what he thinks of the opposition's demands. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4808041">Mr. Chair, I wholeheartedly agree that we should strengthen Minsk. We had problems with the Minsk I agreement. When Minsk II emerged, especially with the trilateral contact group and with the influence of the Normandy Four, it was very durable. It is a process that I believe, and I think the Canadian government believes, will lead to a lasting peace. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808042">The situation in Ukraine requires, initially, security and stability, which we are providing with Operation Unifier. It also requires political involvement. Our political involvement in supporting the peace process with the Minsk II agreements, with the packages of measures that have emerged, especially with the influence of the Normandy Four, are a necessary part of finding a solution in Ukraine. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4808043">Mr. Chair, I am grateful for the opportunity to rise and participate in tonight's take-note debate on Operation Unifier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808044">I want to start by saluting the work of the men and women in the Canadian Armed Forces, who have been participating for some time now, and by expressing my support for their continued involvement in Operation Unifier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808045">There has been great support within the Ukrainian community in Canada. I am fortunate to come from a part of the country where there is a large Ukrainian community that historically has made great contributions to Manitoba and to Winnipeg through the farming culture in rural Manitoba, as well as in Winnipeg's industrial economy and through the railway, particularly CN, which is strong in the community of Transcona, where I am from. This community continues to make great contributions. People continue to immigrate from Ukraine to Transcona. The contribution of Ukraine in my part of the world continues to be a real and important contribution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808046">There is the temptation sometimes to think that it is just because of that close historical connection that people within the Ukrainian community in Canada want to advocate for Ukraine, but it is important to note that it is not just that. It diminishes the great contribution and support that we see from that community to think that somehow it is just a sentimental one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808047">What is going on in Ukraine is not just something to be concerned about if one has a sentimental attachment to Ukraine. It is also about a principle. Russia, as a big superpower, thinks it can get away with simply walking into a neighbour's territory because no one is prepared to stop it. That is a principle that the Ukrainian Canadian community has been standing up to defend. It is not just a sentiment. The community's defence of that principle and its support for Ukraine are important. It is important that we ensure that we are doing everything we can to bring resources to bear in order to make that support real and effective within Ukraine for the sake of Ukraine and for the sake of all the neighbouring states along the Russian border that are also fearful that if what has already transpired in Ukraine is allowed to pass and perhaps worsen, they will be next on the Russian hit list of countries that are going to lose their independence to a large neighbour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808048">If there is going to be some meaningful resistance to Russia's actions within Ukraine and in the territories surrounding it, it is important that it not be just Ukraine against Russia, whether it is supported by Canada and other allies or not. It is important that it not just be Canada against Russia. What is really important is that it be a truly multilateral effort, because no one country standing up to Russia is going to get that message across. Russia needs to hear that the rest of the world is united in standing up to countries that would take advantage of their neighbours and fail to respect the territorial integrity of their neighbours and think that simply because they have the larger army, they can get away with doing whatever they want. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808049">That is why it is so important that Canada participate fully in Operation Unifier. We are not the answer just on our own, but we are a necessary part of the only answer that can check Russian aggression in Ukraine and across the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808050">That is why I am going to respectfully disagree with my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="213898" Type="2">Edmonton Griesbach</Affiliation>. I do think that he is right that a change in position on the part of the United States does not mean that Canada should change its position. Maybe it is just a question of wording, but to say that the change in position on the part of the United States is not relevant is a mistake. It is relevant. It is important for Canada as the closest friend and ally of the United States to also be doing work there, to be doing our utmost on the diplomatic front with the United States to make sure that the new U.S. president's desire to have a closer relationship with Russia does not end up undermining this multilateral effort to help protect and support Ukraine.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="45">(2345)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4808051">It simply would be false to think that the United States does not have a significant possibility of undermining that effort if its position with respect to Ukraine changes substantially in order to court closer relationships with Russia. If that ends up happening, and I am not saying that is what will happen, but we as Canadians have to be prepared to extend our support to Ukraine even diplomatically within the United States if that is what it takes to make sure that the new administration does not let its desire to have a closer relationship with Russia get the better of it. That is an important component of the support we would offer there if it ends up being needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808052">The other thing we could be doing and need to be doing alongside providing training to the Ukrainian armed forces is also to provide training within the civil administration of Ukraine to fight issues of corruption which we know are there and in some cases are undermining the efforts of the armed forces there and of the government. That is an important part. If we are going to provide resources, we need to make sure that the Ukrainian administration is able to receive those and deploy them properly. Providing the kind of training it takes to be able to root out corruption within an administration is an important part of guaranteeing the success of that operation and making sure that the resources we are sending are going to where they are needed so that Ukraine can ultimately be successful in standing up to Russia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808053">Another component of that is the Government of Canada has said that it will join the small arms treaty. It is important that it do that. I believe it was last June when the Liberals said they were going to do it. We are coming up on June again in not too long a time. Participating in international efforts to ensure that when small arms are moving from one country to another they end up where they are supposed to end up and not somewhere else is an important part of being able to supply resources with confidence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808054">Those are some of the things we would like to see the government move forward on. We think that is an essential part of making sure that the resources we are providing to Ukraine are used to their full capacity and do not end up somewhere else. When we talk about some of the difficult things we have to do sometimes to support friends in other countries, that means sometimes saying “no” to people here. We saw it with the Saudi arms deal where we know that people are producing and trading arms out of Canada. Saying “no” to them sometimes is a difficult thing to do because they make a lot of money, but if we are going to be an effective force for peace in the world, we need to make sure that we are not letting people who are producing arms in Canada sell them in ways that result in those arms not being where they should be and getting into the hands of the wrong people. That is important enough that it bears mention in this debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808055">Those are some of my thoughts that I wanted to put on the record for the sake of this take-note debate. I am happy to take a few questions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4808059">Should we be matching that?

              <ParaText id="4808061">Mr. Chair, I think it is good to see bipartisan support in the United States for Ukraine at the level of Congress and the Senate. I think it is troubling that within the White House, there is a new-found desire to look the other way, in some cases, when it comes to what Russia is doing in order to try to build a closer relationship. One worries that it may have a destabilizing effect on multilateral efforts so far, through the NATO umbrella, to support Ukraine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808062">We have seen already with the government how a change in attitude in the White House can change the position of the government. For instance, when the government was first elected, in its eyes, NAFTA was a good deal and there was not much that needed to be changed. A new president came in, and suddenly, through third parties and the media, it was floating the idea of conceding Canada's supply management system as a way to modify that deal. It came out of nowhere for Canadian producers who depend on the supply management system for their livelihoods. That was a bit of a shock.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808063">When we see something like that happen, we have to ask, on other issues where the President is beginning to change U.S. policy, where the government might land.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808064">We see something similar when it comes the very obvious change in the path to immigration for certain refugees who no longer feel safe in the United States. The government wants to maintain, presumably to please the President of the United States, that people crossing through farmer's fields during blizzards with their families is a perfectly status quo way for people to immigrate to Canada, when it is clearly not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808065">We have already seen that a change in the attitude and the position of the President, even without any direct request for the Canadian government to change its point of view, can lead to a change, not just in opinion but also in the policies, in some cases, of the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808066">I think it is important that we keep our eyes open on this file when we hear the President making allusions to needing to improve his own relationship with Russia.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4808072"> It does seem to be the case that there is a need for improvement within Ukraine to ensure that government operates as it should, that it operates properly, and that resources being shepherded by government are managed appropriately. That is going to be part of maintaining any kind of lasting stability for Ukraine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808073">Does Canada have a role to play in training the Ukrainian Armed Forces? Absolutely. Do we have other forms of expertise that would be critical in terms of securing Ukraine's long-term stability and future? Yes, absolutely. I think it is important to try and take that dual-pronged approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808074"> I thank my colleague for raising once again the advocacy that has been undertaken by the Canadian-Ukrainian community here. I think the forceful position that various Canadian governments have taken over the last number of years in supporting Ukraine deserves a lot of credit. As I said, I think it is important to do justice to the work they have done in providing support to Ukraine, that it not simply be interpreted as a kind of sentimental attachment, but that Canadians see it for what it is, which is also a very rigorous and energetic defence of a principle which application extends far beyond the borders of Ukraine.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4808076">I welcome this opportunity to speak to the extension of Operation Unifier, an important component of our support for the Ukrainian people. I know this news was welcomed by the Ukrainian community across Canada, because a significant number of Canadians with close ties to Ukraine live in my riding of Etobicoke—Lakeshore, so I am especially pleased to speak to this issue today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808077">Before I address the mission itself, I would like to acknowledge the strong ties between our two countries, both historically and in today's context. Canada and Ukraine have enjoyed close relations. We were the first western country to recognize Ukraine's independence on December 2, 1991. The bilateral relationship is strengthened by warm people-to-people ties rooted in the 1.3 million-strong Ukrainian Canadian community. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808078">Historic ties of friendship forged through generations of Ukrainian migration to Canada are reinforced by shared values and interests to produce a mature, balanced, and mutually beneficial partnership. The 1994 joint declaration on special partnership, renewed in 2001 and again in 2008, recognizes Canada's support for the development of Ukraine and the importance of our bilateral co-operation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808079">Our goal, with our assistance in Ukraine, is to improve economic opportunities for Ukrainians and a strengthened democracy. Canada is working with the Government of Ukraine and other development partners to rapidly implement the significant reforms needed for Ukraine to realize its full economic potential and build a sound public institutional and legal environment for closer integration with Europe. We have been there on electoral observation missions and we are there now to help it develop the key elements of a democratic infrastructure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808080">Canada has imposed sanctions against more than 270 Russian and Ukrainian individuals and entities. Since January 2014, Canada has sent more than $700 million in much-needed assistance to Ukraine, including $400 million in low-interest loans to help Ukraine stabilize its economy and over $240 million in bilateral development assistance, focusing on democracy measures and sustainable economic growth. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808081">I am proud that this government signed the Canada-Ukraine free trade agreement. The Ukrainian government ratified it last week and we are awaiting passage in the Senate for this to move forward. These are all great steps in strengthening our ties. I could go on, but I am here to talk about the mission. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808082">Since the beginning of the crisis in Ukraine in November 2013, Canada has been at the forefront of the international community's support to the Ukrainian people, as we have heard this evening. The extension of Operation Unifier will continue to involve approximately 200 Canadian Armed Forces personnel deployed in Ukraine until the end of March 2019. Since the start of training in September 2015, more than 3,200 Ukrainian armed forces members have been trained by the Canadian Armed Forces. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808083">The Canadian Forces' primary focus is on tactical soldier training, also known as small team training, which consists of individual weapons training, marksmanship, tactical movement, explosive threat recognition, communication, survival in combat, and ethics training. The training began in the summer of 2015 and is taking place primarily at the International Peacekeeping and Security Centre in Starychi and other locations in western Ukraine. Canada has also contributed military equipment to Ukraine's armed forces. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808084">Furthermore, the CAF is partnered with Ukraine in the military training and co-operation program, an ongoing engagement that will continue to offer a series of opportunities to enhance peace support operations, interoperability, military capacity building, and professional development. The training mission occurs under the rubric of the Multinational Joint Commission, which includes Ukraine, the United States, Canada, Lithuania, and the United Kingdom. Canada joined the joint commission in January 2015, and co-chairs, with Ukraine, the subcommittee on military policing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808085">I understand we are very close to signing a defence co-operation agreement with Ukraine and I am optimistic this, too, will strengthen our ties. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808086">Before I end, I would like to pay homage to the approximately 200 Canadian soldiers headquartered in Edmonton, Alberta, who will be headed to Ukraine as part of Operation Unifier. Soldiers who are currently deployed will be returning to Canada over the coming weeks. On behalf of all Canadians, I thank them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808087">I am a vocal advocate of mental health and I am pleased to see that the forces have the CAF road to mental readiness program.

              <ParaText id="4808107"> Through Operation Uunifier, Canada has already trained more than 3,200 Ukrainian soldiers. More specifically, we have taught Ukrainian personnel how to use weapons and hit targets with greater accuracy and consistency. We have taught them how to communicate effectively on the battlefield, how to survive in combat, and how to make ethically sound decisions in conflict situations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808108">In addition to providing tactical soldier training, we have helped the Ukrainian Armed Forces develop highly specialized skills. We did this through several training programs, four of which are worthy of mention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808109">First, in 2016, we trained more than 140 Ukrainian combat-support specialists in modern logistics, in other words, we taught them how to ensure people, equipment, and supplies get where they are needed when they are needed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808110">Imagine trying to coordinate the movement of hundreds, even thousands of people in a conflict zone while ensuring that enough fuel is available for the equipment, that everyone has food, and that anything needed should they have to fight, is available. It is a tremendous undertaking and Canadian Armed Forces members are among the best at it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808111">In Ukraine, logistics specialists learned everything from convoy operations to vehicle-recovery procedures from Canadian experts who have first-hand experience in supporting military operations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808112">Second, we trained more than 120 military members on how to safely dispose of explosives and improvised explosive devices. These NATO standard procedures were taught through a series of increasingly complex scenarios.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808113">Third, we trained and mentored nearly 800 Ukrainian soldiers in combat first aid, which can dramatically reduce the number of battlefield-related deaths.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808114">Fourth, our military police trained more than 240 of their Ukrainian counterparts in basic investigative techniques and the use of force.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808115">Using both classroom theory and practical exercises, participants covered all the duties and responsibilities typically assigned to a field military police platoon, from controlling traffic and handling detainees, to policing in failed and failing states.</ParaText>

I am proud the government has ensured that Canada will continue this critical work. As part of our whole-of-government support to our trainers and the people of Ukraine, Canada will provide up to $7.25 million in non-lethal equipment assistance, as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808117"> Since the crisis began, Canada has unequivocally condemned the Russian Federation’s clear violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine. We have been clear, principled, and resolute in our response. And we will continue on that path. We will continue to stand by our Ukrainian allies as they work toward their goal of interoperability with NATO by 2020.</ParaText>

First, the Government of Canada, through Global Affairs Canada, is engaged in ongoing secure discussions with the Government of Ukraine regarding Ukraine's security and defence needs. For a one year period ending in May 2016 and as a result of a request from the Ukrainian President, Canada shared satellite imagery products with Ukrainian authorities. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4808129">However, I thought I heard the member opposite say that Ukraine would be fully NATO interoperable by 2020. Does that mean Ukraine will be granted accession to NATO in 2020?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4808133">His excellent speech addressed our intervention in the region, how we are supporting Ukraine's military through Operation Unifier, which is part of a whole-of-government approach in that country. Canada is involved in a broader intervention in the eastern European region, including Operation Reassurance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808134">Could the parliamentary secretary perhaps talk a little more about what Canada plans to do in the central and eastern European regions?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4808136">Our aim in the region is to disincentivize Russia and President Putin. Obviously, we have Operation Unifier, but we also have Operation Reassurance. Last summer, we announced an important operation in Latvia. Four hundred and fifty-five soldiers will be deployed to the region. We will be one of the framework nations that makes decisions. We also know that we have a frigate in the region that has joined the maritime forces, as well as ad hoc monitoring through our F-18s. We are doing a number of things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4808137">We are here to support the region and Canada's mission has intensified in that region. Let us not forget that we supported Ukraine last July by signing the Canada-Ukraine Free Trade Agreement. Our aim is to strengthen that country. We provided Ukraine with military training, but we are also there on an economic level, as well as to provide humanitarian assistance and support their democratic institutions.</ParaText>
