              <ParaText id="4237229">Mr. Speaker, the Canadian steel industry is paramount to our ability to grow the economy. It directly employs over 20,000 Canadians, and further 100,000 Canadians have jobs indirectly because of steel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237230"> The steel industry supplies essential materials to a variety of important sectors, including the automotive, manufacturing, mining, construction, and energy sectors, and it encourages innovation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237231">That said, Canada's steel industry faces a number of challenges. In my riding, Essar Steel Algoma and Tenaris Algoma Tubes are in crisis. They have seen substantial layoffs over the past few years, and if the situation does not improve, this could continue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237232">That is why I am working with the government, the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="214319" Type="4">Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development</Affiliation>, and many others to elevate the conversation on steel. The government will not leave the Canadian steel industry behind. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4237234">Mr. Speaker, last week the Flamborough Chamber of Commerce announced the winners of their 2016 Outstanding Business Achievement Awards. These top businesses will be recognized on April 1 and, I can assure members that they are not fooling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237235"> The Flamborough chamber is a very active organization in our community and is truly a model for supporting the small and medium-sized enterprises that are the backbone of the Canadian economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237236"> While every winner is outstanding in their own right, there will be two special awards given out this year that I want to highlight. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237237">First, the Lifetime Achievement Award will go to Jim Wilkinson of Wilkinson Heavy Precast. Jim is a past president of the Flamborough chamber and his business has been an innovative local manufacturer for over 60 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237238"> Second, the Town of Flamborough Award goes to Pat McNally for 40 years of service to the Rotary Club of Waterdown. What is truly amazing is that Pat is 101 years old, an incredible lifetime community service record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237239">On behalf of all the members of the House, I extend my thanks and congratulations to the Flamborough chamber and the thriving businesses within the Flamborough community.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4237241">I also want to note that the four towns in my riding currently have two female and two male mayors, which is also a first for Thérèse-De Blainville. It is especially fitting that this gender parity came about in the same week that we are celebrating International Women's Day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237242">This equal representation demonstrates that although we still have a ways to go to achieve equality in modern societies, progress is being made quite naturally and to nobody's surprise. I am proud to share this with the House, because in 2016, it is a reality that we can only hope to see replicated across the country and around the world.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4237245">Mackenzie is proof that age does not matter. This 16-year-old Central Algoma Secondary School student has earned every one of her accolades with a string of impressive accomplishments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237246">In the seventh grade at the age of 12, Mackenzie spent three weeks at Queen's Park in the Ontario legislative page program. She followed that up by participating in the inaugural year for Ontario's model parliament. She will be joining us here at Parliament next year as a participant in the forum for young Canadians program. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237247">Mackenzie is also one of two student trustees in the Algoma District School Board. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4237253">The Audain Art Museum is the vision, creation and gift to Canada of Michael Audain and Yoshiko Karasawa. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237254">Their collection of Pacific Northwest First Nations art is unparalleled and offers an exceptional insight into the creative and culturally sophisticated minds of the Coast Salish, Gitxsan, Haida, Haisla, Heiltsuk, Kwakwaka'wakw, Nisga'a, Nuu-chah-nulth, Tlingit and Tsimshian artists of the past as well as the genius of today's contemporary artists both aboriginal and non-aboriginal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237255">The museum was established for the purpose of bringing the art and life of British Columbia from the earliest times to today for all, yet another very good reason to visit Whistler. Canadians will be surprised and moved, and everyone is invited.</ParaText>

In recent years, he took a more public role with the Terry Fox Foundation, visiting local runs across the country and personally signing over 14,000 “thank you” letters every year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237258">Millions of people around the world will mourn the loss of a man whose never-ceasing optimism inspired his son to set out on a journey that would bring hope to those facing the darkest chapter of their lives.</ParaText>

By the 1960s, the St. Lawrence Seaway was moving global cargo abroad, thereby completing multi-modal networks throughout our nation.</ParaText>

Mining contributes $57 billion to our GDP, but it is struggling in a long downturn.

              <ParaText id="4237267">Tomorrow he will be rubbing elbows at the Center for American Progress, which calls Canadian energy “dirty business”. LNG projects are at risk. There is no deal on softwood lumber. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237268">We know making priorities is hard and maybe the government is just not ready yet, but it is a bad pattern.

Too many of these names are on other lists, other lists that are just as shameful: the list of missing and murdered indigenous women, the list of residential school survivors, the list of close to 97,000 households in Toronto that are waiting for affordable housing. None of these are lists that any person should be on.</ParaText>

A committee composed of a select number of MPs is not, and never will be, a substitute for all Canadians having their voices heard. The Liberals have no legitimate case to claim that their House of Commons majority, delivered through a system that they claim is no longer valid, gives them a mandate to change our voting system.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4237597"> Mr. Speaker, with regard to (a) through(d), between December 2009 and December 2015, neither CSC nor any other party of which CSC is aware proposed, conducted, or concluded any evaluation specifically on the efficacy of the Integrated Police and Parole Initiative, or IPPI.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237598">With regard to (e)(i), the decision to conclude the IPPI was based on the results of a national consultation that took place in 2013 with the stakeholders of the intelligence program. Fiscal constraints within CSC generated the impetus for this consultation, including pressure associated with the deficit reduction action plan and the need to contribute to the government’s efforts to balance the budget. A decision to conclude the IPPI by April 1, 2015, was announced in October 2014.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237599">With regard to (e)(ii), the decision was made in order to contribute to the government’s efforts to balance the budget and the need for CSC to assess its intelligence functions within the context of fiscal restraint. CSC made determinations about which intelligence functions were the most critical in ensuring that CSC was able to deliver on its public safety mandate. This review guided the decision to conclude the program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237600">With regard to (e)(iii), between December 2009 and December 2015, neither CSC nor any other party of which CSC is aware conducted any evaluation specifically on the efficacy of the IPPI.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237601">With regard to (e)(iv), the total net cost savings from the conclusion of the IPPI was $600,000 annually.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237602">With regard to (e)(v) and (e)(vi), while there are no plans to reintroduce the IPPI at this point, CSC will continue to work closely with police agencies to maintain partnerships and ensure public safety. More specifically, in 2008-2009, with the provision of integrity funding, CSC established community security intelligence officer, CSIO, positions across the country to enhance community intelligence capacity. Given that the CSIOs are responsible for the planning, coordination, and administration of CSC’s community security intelligence program, CSIOs continue to act as the primary point of contact for police agencies and other partners concerning intelligence-related issues. 
Furthermore, the preventive security and intelligence program continues to provide decision-makers with reliable and timely intelligence and information on potential threats within the offender population. Since the conclusion of the IPPI, CSC has continued to productively engage with law enforcement on community intelligence issues, the recapture of offenders who have gone unlawfully at large, and offender release planning through effective information sharing and consultation in order to deliver the best possible public safety results for Canadians.

              <ParaText id="4237650">We are making these major changes for two general reasons: one, we promised to do that in our election platform and in my mandate letter; and two, the acts that we are carrying out in this new law are consistent with what we promised to do. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237651">From the government's point of view and my point of view, we are doing what we said we would do. What is more important is why we want to do this. On this side, I would say there are two basic principles at stake.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="4237652">That is unacceptable to us. There should be only one class of Canadians, not two. That is the first principle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237653">As far as the second principle is concerned, we want to welcome new citizens to Canada. The Conservative legislation put up a number of roadblocks that we believe made it unreasonably harder for permanent residents to become Canadian.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="4237654">Therefore, there are two points of principle. First, there must be one class of Canadian, not two. Second, we want to welcome new citizens. We believe the Conservatives erected a number of barriers that were unreasonable to the welcoming of new people to become citizens of our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237655">Let me go through each of these general areas one at a time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237656">In the previous Conservative bill, the minister of citizenship and immigration had the authority to revoke an individual citizenship if that person was convicted of a terrorist crime or some other crime. However, and this is a crucial point, the minister only had the power to revoke citizenship if the person involved was a dual citizen, not if the person was a citizen only of Canada. Similarly, the Federal Court had the right to revoke citizenship in other cases, but again only for dual citizens. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237657">This is the nub of the point because once we say we can revoke one type of Canadian citizenship but cannot revoke another, then we have two classes of Canadians. We believe very strongly, and we fought long and hard during the election on this issue, that there is only one class of Canadian, a Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian. All Canadians are equal and there cannot be two classes of Canadians, which is why we found this law unacceptable and why the new law would revoke that right to revoke citizenship. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237658">We have said it for many months with the conviction of our beliefs, and once the law passes, we can also say it in the spirit of the law. It will say there is only one class of Canadian, not two. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237659">In fact, we believe this so strongly that we are going to reinstate the citizenship of the one individual who had his citizenship revoked for reasons of terrorism. That individual, according to the new law, will have his citizenship reinstated. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237660">It is a point of principle. When we say a Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian, that includes good and bad Canadians. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4237661">The bad Canadians who are convicted for terrorism should go to prison. If there are bad terrorists, they should go to prison for a long time, although it is the judges, not the politicians, who determine the sentences. The place for a terrorist is in prison, not at the airport. It is our strong belief that if a person is sent to prison for terrorism, there should not be two classes of terrorists: those who go to prison and have their citizenship revoked and those who only go to prison. A Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian, for a terrorist and for others, and therefore in our view we will not have any citizenship revoked for this reason.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237662">I would also make the supplementary argument that to revoke citizenship in this way is to launch oneself on a slippery slope, because the rules might be clear today about for what crime we have citizenship revoked and for what crime do we not, but those laws can change over time. I remember the former prime minister in the election campaign speculating about additional crimes that might be added. Who knows? It might be terrorism one year, and something else—whatever catches the attention of the government of the day—could be added the next year. It is a slippery slope, and one does not know where on that slope one will end up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237663"> The definition of what constitutes dual citizenship is also a slippery slope. I am not a lawyer, but I know legal minds have debated the issue of who is a dual citizen and who is not. Some individuals might be born in Canada, have never been to some second country, but are nevertheless dual citizens of that country because of the laws of that country. Some people have claimed that Jews are dual citizens in a sense, because they have the right to live in Israel. Does that make them dual citizens of Canada and Israel? Under the previous law, that might have been a question that went before the courts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237664">Our view is that we should just terminate this slippery slope. We should abolish 100% the practice of revoking citizenship for any kind of terrorism or other crime. The debate would therefore be moot. It would not matter who is a dual citizen and who is not, or which crimes are included, because under no circumstances would a person have his or her citizenship revoked for these reasons. These other secondary, slippery-slope arguments would simply not arise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237665">The last point I would make on this issue is that there is one reason that is still the case for individuals to have their citizenship revoked, and that has always been on the books, and that is if individuals misrepresent who they are when they become citizens. In that situation that would imply that the individuals do not deserve to be citizens because they gave false information in order to become citizens. If that is the case, then their citizenship can be revoked. That has been the case in Canada since 1947, and that will remain the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237666">There is one thing I might mention that the parliamentary committee may wish to consider. After we came out with our law, certain legal individuals said that, when a person has his or her citizenship revoked for this one remaining reason that is allowed, that person may or may not have sufficient right to appeal. If after listening to witnesses, the committee agrees that there is insufficient right to appeal such a decision, then the government and I would certainly be prepared to contemplate such an amendment to our bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237667">This makes a more general point, unlike the previous government; but allow me to just talk for this government. We are certainly open to amendments, if there are amendments from either the Liberal side or the opposition side that would improve the bill. We do not claim perfection. If some members on the committee, of any party, have ideas for how to improve it, we would be open to such suggestions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237668">I just mentioned this one as a case in point: I heard in the debate following the introduction of the bill that there may not be an adequate right to appeal in the case of citizenship revocation flowing from providing false information.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4237669">That covers my first general point about citizenship revocation. The second area concerns barriers that we think in some cases are unnecessary or inappropriate barriers to citizenship, and there are four areas where we will change the previous bill, in some cases, substantially.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="4237670">I can read the four items that we are going to change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237671">First, the 2015 measures required anyone applying to become a Canadian citizen to declare their intent to live in Canada once citizenship was obtained. We are going to get rid of that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237672">The measures also prolonged the residency requirement for applicants, requiring them to stay in Canada for a much longer period before being able to apply for citizenship. We are also going to change that, as I will explain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237673">They also eliminated the possibility of applying half of the time applicants spent in Canada before becoming permanent residents in the calculation of the duration of their physical presence here. This affects international students.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237674">Finally, as for the fourth item, the measures required applicants 14 to 64 to meet language and knowledge criteria. Previously, only applicants 18 to 54 had to meet those criteria. We are going to reinstate the previous age requirement, 18 to 54.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="4237675">Let me quickly go through each of these in turn. The first point concerns the intention to reside, that people have to declare before they become a citizen that they intend to reside in Canada. Some people in the legal profession were concerned that it could then become a reason to revoke citizenship. Let us say people stated an intent to reside in Canada, and let us say they were telling the truth, then their company shifted them to New York or whatever and the circumstances changed. It was feared that, having invoked this intent to reside, they could subsequently be challenged if their plans changed. The simplest way to deal with that is to get rid of that provision, which is what we are doing. We are repealing it. We think that was a legitimate concern, and we do not think there is merit to retaining that element of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237676">The second part is the physical presence requirement. We believe that people should be required to be physically present in Canada for a certain length of time. We believe there is significant citizenship fraud or citizens of convenience, so we do want to continue to attack that. We do not dispute the principle of having a certain length of time in which people have to be physically present in Canada, but we are bringing it back to where it was, or at least changing it from what the Conservatives had, that they have to be physically present in Canada for four out of the past six years. We are moving to three out of the past five years, which is somewhat more flexible and also allows citizenship applicants to become citizens one year earlier than was the case under the previous bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237677">The third item is one where I feel there is a particular lack of intelligence in the previous bill. If we look at international students, we see they are one of the most fertile grounds for new Canadians. We have an aging population. We really need more immigrants, and who better than international students, in the sense that by definition they are educated, by definition they know something about Canada, and almost by definition they can speak English or French? What better group to solicit to become Canadians than international students?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4237678">Why then do we sort of punch them in the nose, instead of courting them, by taking away the entitlement they previously had that 50% of the time they had spent in Canada as international students would count toward becoming citizens? I think they have clearly earned that entitlement by being here, learning about Canada, and so on. Therefore, I do not see why that entitlement should be removed, and indeed, in this bill, we are restoring it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237679">Someone asked me why not 100%, and we can have that debate. I think 50% might be a good number, but certainly not zero. I think we should go back to where it was, 50%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237680">Finally, this is a simple point on language. Again, we agree in principle that knowing English or French is really important, and we are not abolishing that requirement at all. Research has shown that knowledge of one or more of the official languages helps to predict an individual's success in this country, economically and job-wise. Therefore, we are not eliminating that, but we are restoring the age range to where it was, which is the age of 18 to 54, rather than 14 to 64.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="4237681">In sum, we disagree with the Conservative government's legislation based on two general principles. First, a Canadian is a Canadian. All Canadians are equal. We must not have two classes of citizens. Second, we want to welcome newcomers as Canadians, and we do not want the conditions for becoming Canadian to be too rigid or too difficult.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="4237682">In summary, it is for those reasons that I am pleased to present to the House our proposals in Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document>.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4237683">Mr. Speaker, certainly some of the proposals in the bill may lead to changes, or increases in the workload for visa officers and immigration officers who are processing other lines of business outside of the refugee stream. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237684">I noticed in question 19, which was tabled by the parliamentary secretary earlier today, that 220 employees, if I read this correctly, have been temporarily assigned to processing Syrian refugee applications from the central processing region. If I am correct, the types of business lines that are impacted there include the processing of spousal sponsorship applications. I wonder if my colleague could tell the House how the transferring of 220 employees affected other business lines during the processing of the Syrian refugee initiative. This was up until December 15 of last year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237685">I note that in the response to the question, it also says that other employees were transferred around. If they are transferring employees from other business lines, given they might not be trained on certain activities or whatnot, might that impact the processing times for things like spousal sponsorship? Could the minister explain how the department has been impacted in that regard?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4237686">Mr. Speaker, I can say that I certainly make no apology for some employees being transferred around to expedite the Syrian refugee operation. It was a big commitment that we made and a big priority, and I think Canadians have come to support this initiative. Indeed, even the official opposition has supported our Syrian refugee initiative. It was a high priority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237687">The way in which we will address processing times for families, as we said during the election, is to, one, commit more resources and hire more individuals to interview people, and two, learn from the experience of Syrian refugees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237688">One definition of real change is to do something one has never done before. The public servants in my department have never processed refugees as quickly and efficiently as they did. Therefore, we will learn from the lessons they learned in expediting refugee processing. We will also learn from that how to move much faster on the processing of spouses and other family members. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237689">We will achieve our objectives on processing times, first by providing more resources, but at least as important, by learning from our experience on the Syrian refugees and importing that experience to make processes for families way more efficient and rapid than they have been in the past.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4237690">Mr. Speaker, the minister talked about the language issue. There is no question in my mind that speaking some English and French is an important component to this process. With that being said, when many immigrants come here, the question becomes the level of proficiency in the language that would need to be examined.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237691">Under the current system, the people send in results of an accepted third party test at the equivalent of a Canadian language benchmark level 4 or higher in speaking or listening, or provide proof of completion of a secondary or post-secondary program conducted in French or English. If they do not send those documents to prove they have met this requirement, their application for citizenship will not be accepted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237692">I know of many people who are not at that level, but they contribute greatly economically. They pay their taxes, they raise their families, and they participate in their community. If we do not remove these barriers, I am afraid it will prevent them from becoming citizens and, ultimately, engaging fully in a democratic society, which is having the right to vote.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237693">Further, the other piece related to barriers to citizenship is the application fees and the high costs of those.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237694">Under the Conservative government, the fees went up, from $100 to $530, for an adult, with an additional $100 for a child. Therefore, that also poses financial barriers for people to access the pathway to citizenship. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237695">Would the minister agree with me that both of those items need to be addressed and will he take action in that regard?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4237696">Mr. Speaker, I do agree that both of those are very legitimate questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237697">On the point about the fees, we made no commitment to reduce the fees. It is something we will examine going forward, but this is not in this legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237698">On the question of the language, there are two issues. There is the age at which the test is applied and the level of the test.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237699">What we have amended in the bill is the age. While I think the hon. member and I both agree that language is important, traditionally in Canada some older people would arrive without the best English in the world and it would improve over time. However, their children, and for sure their grandchildren, would have perfect, or virtually perfect, English or French. In our view, to put the age back to 54 rather than 64 was in deference in part to older people, although I am now 65, so I never thought 64 years old was that old, but older compared with many others. We thought that was an appropriate move.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237700">On the question of level, that point has been raised by my provincial counterparts from British Columbia and Ontario. We will meet next week and we will talk about that. I do not think the level would be in the legislation because it would be a matter for regulation, but at what level those tests should be is a legitimate item for discussion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4237703">Mr. Speaker, there always has to be a balance here. I would not deny that it is always a good thing for newcomers to Canada to have a good knowledge of English or a good knowledge of French, or even both. However, the balance has to be made between the situation of the newcomers and the situation they are coming to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237704">If people are 60 years old and they are coming with perhaps children and a spouse, it is normal to think that their English language skills would not necessarily be so great as if they were younger. If they are older people, their children will probably be fluent, or near fluent, and certainly their grandchildren will be. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237705">The way we have always done it in our country is that often people on the initial entry had far from perfect English, but then they improved, and their children and grandchildren were perfectly fluent. We are trying to seek that balance between needing the language and being reasonable in the face of people of varying ages and varying backgrounds. I hope that what we have come up with in the bill might strike the right balance.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4237713">Mr. Speaker, so much of Canada's history and our history through immigration is a collection of stories. I would like to start with a very brief one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237714">On August 29, 1900, in the village of Zavar in Slovakia, a woman named Maria Krajcovic was born. The town was a very small farming town, primarily agricultural. She grew up there. She married a man named Frank Oravec. They had two young daughters, named Helen and Stefania.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237715">In the early 1930s, when both of their girls were still quite young, I believe under the age of seven, Frank decided to travel to Canada to work with the CPR. That was a very difficult decision at the time. One can imagine leaving a wife and two young daughters at a time when Europe was becoming increasingly more uncertain. It was a quite difficult decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237716">Maria had to sell some of her property and move in with her mom in order to take care of her daughters while Frank was overseas working to save enough money to send back to the family. Thankfully Maria was quite a talented seamstress. She did needlework and made beautiful lace, and was able to support and provide a living for her daughters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237717">However, in the late 1930s, things became very unstable in Slovakia. I believe it was in March 1939 when things got really serious. I should have my dates correct when I tell a story, but I believe it was November 1940 when Hitler's Nazis took over the country. It was a very bleak time indeed for the citizens of Zavar.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237718">In July 1938, Maria did all of the paperwork, and it was very difficult at this time, to get her two daughters to a point where they could travel overseas and join her husband in Canada. That took place in July 1938, right before all of this happened. They travelled to Winnipeg to start a home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237719">At this time, Helen was 15 years old. They came to Canada with nothing. Helen had to work, cleaning homes. While she worked close to 15-hour days, she put herself through school in the evenings to learn English. She worked really hard. She ended up marrying a man who was 25 years her senior. She had five girls and they farmed in Starbuck.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237720">She has been known to say that people are lucky if they get one good year out of five. When her daughters were all very young, she was widowed, and she had to make the decision to move into Winnipeg with her five young girls. She worked two jobs to put food on the table.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237721"> One of her five girls, Kim recounts not seeing her mom very often. Kim put herself through school as well. She got married very young. She had two daughters named Cherie and Michelle. Kim went back to school when she was in her 30s. Helen decided that she would spend her retirement years raising Sherry and Michelle. She imparted many values of Slovak heritage, hard work, and ethic into those girls.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237722">I have my family's original voyage of passage here today. I remember when I found this document in my grandmother's house as we were packing up to put her into an assisted living facility. I remember asking her why she would make the decision to do this, and why great-gramma would bring the family overseas. She said that they did it to be safe, to be free, to build their future and mine, and to build a better country. With that in my heart, I find myself here today in Canada's Parliament speaking to the bill before us.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4237723">Canada is a country of immigrants who stand on the traditional lands of, and shoulder-to-shoulder with, first nations and aboriginal peoples who bring their wealth of experience, their thoughts, their hopes, their desires, and their dreams together under a banner of pluralism, freedom, and language.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237724">This makes us unique. Our diversity is our competitive advantage. It keeps our economy growing. It keeps our public policy discourse vibrant. It enriches our civil society and keeps us hopeful and optimistic. Because of this, in my view, immigration policy in Canada should never be about why but about how. In this I believe that my Liberal colleagues and I are united. The bill contains a lot of how. It contains fundamental changes to how and under what circumstances we grant citizenship in our country, and for that it should be scrutinized carefully and objectively, which I will try to do now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237725">First of all, the bill has several components. The first component the minister has already spoken to, and removes the grounds of the revocation of Canadian citizenship that relate to national security. The minister spoke at length on this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237726">I am really enjoying this critic portfolio because I believe that immigration will be at the core of many of the public policy challenges we will be facing in the next 10 to 20 years in Canada, especially since we have an aging workforce. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237727">I believe that new Canadians enrich and strengthen our country. Their experiences and perspectives, as much as my experience is grounded in the experience of immigrants, make us stronger. As I said, it leads to more vibrant public policy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237728">My concern with this element of the bill is that it is the government's first priority. It does revoke the citizenship of a convicted terrorist and I do not think we can be glib or flippant about that. I will be the first one to admit that issues pertaining to this were highly contentious during the election campaign, but because they are contentious, it does not absolve us in this place of the ability and the duty to speak to these issues. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237729">I find it shocking that this is the government's first priority in the bill, and I do not accept the argument that the former government's act somehow created two classes of citizens. It did not, and there are other grounds by which citizenship can be revoked, which the minister did not really speak to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237730">I read an article about two Nazi war criminals in 2007 who had their citizenship revoked. Citizenship can still be revoked on the grounds of fraudulent methods, so there are other provisions in Canadian law that the bill does not change. It allows for citizenship revocation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237731">The discussion around this provision really boils down to what we value about Canadian citizenship. The Liberal government has put forward the following argument. If someone is a convicted terrorist and has dual national citizenship, the government believes that the person can serve his or her term out in jail and that this would be an appropriate penalty for that. The alternative to that is that if someone is a dual national citizen and has committed a terrorist act against Canada, which does affect all Canadians, as we saw here in October 2014, their citizenship should be revoked.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237732">I am trying to be very respectful here and would ask the Liberals that as we go forward in the debate here, we do not debase this conversation to a fallacy, that the existing act created two classes of Canadian citizenship. This is a choice on punishment for a very serious act against our nation. The bill makes a choice in that regard. For that reason, I oppose this particular section of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237733">The second section of the bill removes the requirement that an applicant intends, if granted citizenship, to continue to reside in Canada. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4237734">As I was cleaning out a trunk in my grandmother's basement, it was incredible to find newspaper clippings from the 1940s from the <I>Winnipeg Free Press</I>, which talked about the role of the Slovak community during wartime and its nascent roots in Winnipeg. When people moved to Winnipeg—my family, my ancestors—it was not all about tough times but joy. My great-grandma wrote a play. She was an actor. I guess there was something inherited there. She contributed to the community. I also found records of my great-grandfather who fundraised for the Slovak Catholic parish in Winnipeg. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237735">When we celebrate immigration and diversity, we should be celebrating the fact that we want people to stay here and enjoy the experience of being a Canadian and contributing back to our country. It is what has made us amazing. It is what we should be celebrating as we work towards Canada's 150th anniversary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237736">It is quite reasonable, given that this is the spirit that binds our pluralism, to say that when people want to become Canadian citizens, they intend to stay here and make this nation stronger, as we commit to do the same for them. Taking this requirement out of the existing act removes the spirit and intent of that legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237737">The third component of this bill seeks to reduce the number of days during which a person must have been physically present in Canada before applying for citizenship. The same argument applies there. I was reading the committee testimony for the bill that was previously before Parliament and made some of these changes. Some of the quotes from the testimony can be distilled to the following, that the longer an individual lives, works, or studies in Canada, the greater connection that person will have to our beautiful and special country. I do not see this as a punitive measure. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237738">I say that if people become citizens of this country, which I hope they do, and want to run for office, vote, or have any of the privileges that are accorded with Canadian citizenship, the time they have spent here gives them a greater understanding of Canadian pluralism and what unites us, such as gender equality, freedom of speech, freedom of sexual orientation, all the things that allow us to function and coexist as a nation of many nations under the same common banner. They need to experience that to be Canadian citizens, and that is the spirit of what this change was. That is my concern with reducing it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237739">I also do not think it provides an unnecessary barrier. I am looking forward to hearing witnesses at committee who can argue otherwise, but going into that debate, my sense is that it imparts the value of Canadian citizenship and imparts to people going through the citizenship process the point that Canada wants to invest in them during that process. We want to welcome them into our cultural institutions, we want them to learn what it means to be Canadian citizens, we want them to understand the public policy dialogue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237740">The fourth section limits the requirement to demonstrate knowledge of Canada in one of its official languages to applicants between the ages of 18 and 54. Previously, that restriction was set at 64 years of age. We often talk about one of the public policy challenges that we will be dealing with in the next 10 years, which is how to continue to knit together Canada's pluralism, which I just spoke about, as we increase and embrace more Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237741">I will add that the Conservative government welcomed over 1.6 million new Canadians during its time in office, which was a significant number. Moreover, year over year on an annualized basis, that number was significantly higher than under the previous government to ours. I applaud its efforts to look at the citizenship numbers and situations, but I also think, to give credit where credit is due, that Conservatives increased that number significantly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237742">As we continue to do that and look at pluralism, there are many things that unite us, and language is one of them. Language is a unifier. Language binds us together. It allows us to have shared common experiences that we can communicate. I strongly believe that rather than talking about reducing the age limit, we should be talking about whether it is a barrier for someone over that age. I would argue that 55 is not that old. Fifty-five is probably the new 18. It is not that old. I would argue that someone who is 55 years old, or 54, still has a significant amount of life experience to contribute. If it is a barrier to learning the language, then how do we overcome the barrier?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4237743">One of the things that concerns me about the Syrian refugee initiative is the reports that new people coming to Canada through that initiative are waiting months for access to language training services. I am not sure why the government's first reaction in the bill has been to lower the language requirements rather than asking how we can help them learn the language. That is important. It allows them to participate in so many different facets of Canadian society in a way that opens doors to them. It allows them to experience so many different things. That is why language proficiency is so important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237744">I am really curious why the government would reduce this. It is something I look forward to hearing about at committee as well. My gut reaction to this after I found some of my grandmother's notes is that we should be asking how we can help someone learn English rather than reducing the requirement. She was 15 years old and worked so hard to learn English. She put herself through that program by herself. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237745">There are other components of the bill, which I believe are more technical amendments, which I do support. Overall, especially in the context of the government's tabling of its immigration levels report yesterday, I feel that it is a separate policy argument for a separate time. The government is proposing a significant change to the ratio of people who come to Canada under economic immigration classes, like the federal skilled worker programs, versus those who come in through streams such as the refugee initiative. However, in the context of the provisions of the bill, those numbers are very important. If we are talking of a 250% increase in refugees coming into Canada and our first response has been to lower the language requirement, I hope we can have more language training services. However, the age that someone can become a Canadian citizen without language proficiency is an issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237746">When we talk about changing the intent to reside in Canada, when we are increasing overall numbers of immigrants to Canada, that is an issue. How are we providing services?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237747">I asked a question of the minister earlier, which is serious. There are so many people who want to come to our country that processing times are an issue. I hear about that every day. How can we fix spousal sponsorship processing times? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237748">If we are changing the system and changing the formula of how many people come to our country, and we do not have a plan to resource that, either through faster processing times or providing long-term housing to refugees, that is of concern. My colleague from the NDP, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214258" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation>, talks about 70% of refugees still being in temporary accommodation. Regardless of political stripe, that is something we need to be concerned about. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237749">My concern with the bill is that it puts the cart before the horse in a lot of ways. It looks at issues that perhaps are not of the utmost concern with regard to immigration policy in Canada. I hope we can come to some sort of consensus because this is something that is going to affect our country over the next 10 years. We need people from other countries to ensure that lack of skilled labour is not detrimental to economic growth, that we are meeting our humanitarian obligations overseas, and we are looking at family reunification, but we are doing it in a way that is resourced. It should be done in the context of a budget that is manageable and with an overall plan for the economy that allows that Canadian advantage, that thing that brought my great-grandmother over to this country with two young girls and nothing else. </ParaText>

Someone can intend to reside, but life circumstances, such as a relative in another country becoming severely ill, could interrupt that intention.</ParaText>

As it happens, she is in the film industry. She travels a lot with her work. Sometimes she is away for a week. Other times, she may be away for a year or more. There is no telling. It is all subject to her work.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4237799">The Conservative Bill <Document DbId="6401990" Type="3">C-24</Document> also made the pathway to citizenship for immigrants harder, longer, and frankly with other measures, more expensive to obtain. Accessibility to citizenship is the ultimate pathway to a person's right to fully participate in a democratic society. The cornerstone of a democracy is imbedded in having the right to vote. Creating additional barriers to access this citizenship only serves to undermine our democratic institution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237800">To that end, the NDP also supports the measure in Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document> that returns physical presence requirements to what they were prior to Bill <Document DbId="6401990" Type="3">C-24</Document>, allowing time in Canada prior to obtaining permanent residence to partially count toward the physical presence requirement.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4237804">As stated by Mitch Goldberg, president of the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers, “Instead of welcoming new Canadians, the new Citizenship Act discriminates against them”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237805">Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document> would rectify this, and the NDP welcomes the amendments proposed under Bill C-6.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237806">With that being said, I would be remiss if I did not turn my attention to what is missing in Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document> as well. First, on the right to judicial review before losing citizenship, I was glad to hear the minister reference this, and his willingness to entertain amendments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237807">Prior to Bill <Document DbId="6401990" Type="3">C-24</Document>, individuals who were accused of fraud and risked having their citizenship revoked could request a hearing before a Federal Court judge who would review the minister's evidence. A final decision would then be made by the Governor in Council.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237808">Bill <Document DbId="6401990" Type="3">C-24</Document> allowed the minister to make a decision based on a review of paperwork with no right to a judicial hearing. The NDP believes that a citizen facing revocation should always have the right to a hearing before an independent and impartial decision-maker.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237809">Under Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document>, which was tabled, we believe that the Liberals agree with that as well. In fact, the Liberals tabled an amendment to Bill <Document DbId="6401990" Type="3">C-24</Document>, which would provide the right to a full appeal to the Federal Court in the case of citizenship revocation proceedings. In support of the amendment, a Liberal member stated quite clearly that Canadians deserve the right to appeal with regard to citizenship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237810">However, today the Liberal Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document> does not deliver on that sentiment. The Liberals' failure to address this feature of Bill <Document DbId="6401990" Type="3">C-24</Document> means, I am afraid, that there may still be a constitutional challenge of the Citizenship Act, which would be viable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237811">Second, on the issue regarding people charged with a criminal offence abroad, Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document> does not amend the provision that prohibits granting citizenship to anyone charged with or serving a sentence for a criminal offence abroad. This broad measure fails to account for countries dealing with corruption within government and the judicial system, as well as governments engaging in political prosecution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237812">The Canadian Bar Association and others have further argued that this prohibition was far too broad and created significant inequalities between applicants, depending on their country of origin.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4237813">Additionally, the Canadian Bar Association has suggested that these cases are best dealt with by the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and the Immigration and Refugee Board, where cases can be determined upon their individual merits, and the NDP agrees with the recommendation of the Canadian Bar Association.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237814">Third is discretionary citizenships granted by the minister. Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document> would not require the minister to disclose cases where citizenship is granted for discretionary reasons, the frequency of citizenships granted, or the reasons for granting citizenship at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237815">We want to ensure that privacy rights are respected, and we should work within those boundaries. However, it is problematic to not make information available, because it speaks to the lack of transparency. Given the recent example we have seen of, I think, the hyperpartisan former minister of citizenship and immigration, under the Conservatives, I think we need more transparency and accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237816">Fourth is the issue of language. While Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document> would revoke the changes made by Bill <Document DbId="6401990" Type="3">C-24</Document> by bringing back the language knowledge requirements for applicants aged 18 to 54 instead of 14 to 64, the threshold for language proficiency under Bill C-24 remains.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237817">Under the current system, they must send in results of an accepted third party test at the equivalent of Canadian language benchmark level 4 or higher in speaking or listening, or provide proof of completion of a secondary or post-secondary program conducted in French or English. If they do not send in documents to prove that they have met this requirement, their application for citizenship will not be accepted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237818">The higher language requirement does not demonstrate that they are somehow more Canadian.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237819">As well, Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document> would maintain the requirement for citizenship applicants to pass a knowledge test about Canada in one of the two official languages. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237820">Effectively, this would amount to double testing and would not really represent an individual's ability to function and succeed in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237821">Many immigrants have come to Canada who have not been able to read and write in French or English at the proficiency level that is currently required, but they have worked hard, paid taxes, raised their families, contributed to our society, and become an integral part of our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237822">I can share with members the story of my own family. We all came, and none of us spoke English. To this day, I would say that, if my mother were put to a test such as the one that exists right now, she would likely fail that test. Yet, all of her life since she immigrated here, she worked, first as a farm worker, making $10 a day to support a family of eight. Then she got a minimum-wage job at a restaurant, which she retired from at 65, and she supported her family every single day with those efforts. She spoke minimum English—enough to get by, enough to support her family, enough to vote and understand what voting means and what democracy means.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237823">With that being said, I would argue that the proficiency test is way too high for far too many immigrants, and that must change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237824">Fifth is the issue of financial barriers. Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document> does not address how much permanent residents should pay for their citizenship applications to be processed by the ministry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237825">Citizenship processing fees have increased from $100 to $530 since February 2014, under the Conservatives. This is on top of the additional $100 right of citizenship fee. A family of four would have to pay $1,460. That is more than a month's rent for many. A family's bank account should not be the deciding factor on whether or not they can become Canadian citizens. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237826">I really hope that the Liberal government will change this. Access to the pathway to citizenship is critical for all immigrants. Let us make it easier, not harder, to attain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237827">Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document> would not make access to citizenship financially accessible for many permanent residents and their families. I do hope that the Liberal government acts to reduce the financial barriers along the path to citizenship. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237828">Sixth is ensuring fair processing delays. Under the Conservatives, the processing delays for citizenship applications exploded to 24 months for regular cases and 36 months for non-routine cases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237829">The Liberals have committed to processing all applications received before April 1, 2015, by March 31, 2016, and to processing new applications within a 12-month period.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4237830">However, this one-year delay does not apply to non-routine cases, which are often only called this because a residence questionnaire was issued. This creates an enormous gap of 24 months, perpetrating a two-tier system, and we believe this should be changed as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237831">The NDP will continue to push the Liberal government to take these measures and to act urgently on lengthy wait times, huge backlogs, the issue around family reunification for parents and grandparents, and the barriers to citizenship that still remain in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237832">New Canadians provide countless benefits to this country every single day. We see many of those Canadians in this very chamber, some elected for the first time. Others are returning members. That is the testimony of who we are, and it speaks about the strength of Canada to harness that. Those rules that create barriers for access to citizenship must be changed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237833"> This deserves a system that recognizes all immigrants for their contributions in making Canada the wonderful country it is. We are built on a multicultural community basis. Let us harness those strengths, eliminate the barriers, and make sure Canada in its process, in its policies, and in its approach is truly Canadian and reflects our multicultural values.</ParaText>

The Conservative government went to great lengths to devalue Canadian citizenship, to make Canadians unequal, and to separate Canadians by the age of their stock. The minister warned that revocation of citizenship on the basis of a particular crime is a slippery slope, a sentiment with which I could not agree more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237835">I have citizenship in two countries and eligibility for citizenship in two more. I have never been to any of those other three countries where I either have or am eligible to have citizenship. My two-year-old daughter has multiple citizenships as well. Among my wife, me, and my daughter, we are either citizens of or are eligible to be citizens of Canada, Ireland, the Philippines, Spain, and Israel. This is the result from being from families of immigrants from all over the world. It does not even list the numerous countries like France, Turkey, Poland, and Australia where I have ancestry but not citizenship.</ParaText>

Why should my daughter be subject to a slippery slope whereby she could be stripped of her Canadian citizenship and sent to another country in which she has theoretical eligibility for citizenship, but has never been and may not even have the intention to explore because of breaking that law the particular government has passed?

Liberals gloss over the fact that this bill strips citizenship from convicted terrorists, that nobody needs to worry about this bill unless they plan on committing an act of terrorism. Those are the people who are liable to lose their citizenship. The Conservatives' position is that convicted terrorists do not have a right to be part of the Canadian family if they are not going to accept our fundamental values. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4237845">On the contrary, Mr. Speaker. The truth of the matter is that if people commit crimes, whatever crime it might be, whether a crime of national interest or any other crime, they should go through the Canadian judicial system equally, fairly, and independently. Everyone should go through that process. No one should be able to escape that process. They should go to trial and then, if convicted, through the sentencing process as well. There should not be a two-tier process of what the sentencing might be depending on one's place of origin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237846">That being said, on the issue of fraud, the member actually raised a slightly different point, in this sense. When people commit fraud in their applications, they are effectively providing false information. They are lying about the information that they are putting forward. If that is the case, then there needs to be a mechanism to address that and that is what the bill speaks to.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4237861">Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with my friend from Surrey—Newton.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237862">It is a pleasure to rise today to speak to the government's plan to repeal the unfair provisions found under the Citizenship Act that were passed in the previous Parliament under Bill <Document DbId="6401990" Type="3">C-24</Document>, which allowed for the revocation of Canadian citizenship of dual or multiple nationals on the grounds of national interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237863">Once again, our government is delivering on the commitments we promised Canadians during last year's federal election. From my perspective, Bill <Document DbId="6401990" Type="3">C-24</Document> is not only a bill that personally affects the lives of many of my constituents but it also affects many Canadians across this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237864"> I note that in the speech by the <Affiliation DbId="214309" Type="4">Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship</Affiliation>, he articulated two broad principles that governed the intent behind Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237865"> First and foremost, he enunciated the concept of a Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian, which was something that we had heard throughout the campaign, and that we found the notion of two different types of classes of Canadian citizens to be offensive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237866">The second concept that was articulated by the minister was with respect to peeling back the changes found in Bill <Document DbId="6401990" Type="3">C-24</Document> that imposed new barriers on welcoming immigrants to this country and becoming Canadian citizens. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237867">There are a series of four provisions within Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document> that attempt to bring back a much more welcoming atmosphere to becoming a Canadian citizen. Those are very important principles. However, I want to focus on two different principles. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237868">I first want to note that I appreciated the speech made by my friend from the New Democratic Party, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214258" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation>, who I thought articulated in very clear terms the reasons why her party would be supporting the provisions of Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document>. She also put forth some legitimate criticisms that she found, namely, that we did not necessarily go far enough in Bill C-6. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237869">I take the point the minister raised that this government remains open to making reasonable changes, which is a reflection of this particular government. For example, this government would definitely entertain some of the issues the member articulated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237870">I want to get to those two broad principles that I would like to articulate in the short time I have to talk to Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document> that I feel were particularly offensive under Bill <Document DbId="6401990" Type="3">C-24</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237871">The first concept I want to advance, which was a central theme that had been articulated by the previous government and in particular by the former minister of citizenship and immigration, Chris Alexander, is the concept that citizenship is a privilege as opposed to a right. I strongly disagree with the former minister's position on this substantive fate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237872">The whole concept of strengthening the Canadian Citizenship Act, as minister Alexander had framed it, was that citizenship was somehow a privilege. From my perspective, once it is conferred, it attaches rights. There are obligations and responsibilities that come with citizenship, but it confers rights that are protected specifically under the charter, as my friend from <Affiliation DbId="214258" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation> had noted. Therefore, once it is legitimately acquired, the concept of citizenship should not be taken away capriciously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237873"> That brings me to the second concept. My friends in the New Democratic Party touched upon this particular theme both in the comments made by my friend from <Affiliation DbId="214258" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation> and in the question from the finance critic for the NDP, which is the concept of the encroachment of executive power and the lack of procedural due process that was found under Bill <Document DbId="6401990" Type="3">C-24</Document>. Again, I deeply oppose this concept.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="30">(1730)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4237874">I take the comments that my friend from <Affiliation DbId="214258" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation> noted seriously. She remains concerned that there needs to be procedural due process whenever citizenship is stripped away. This government would be amendable to those kinds of amendments to the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237875">I found particularly odious the previous government's perspective to grant the minister the arbitrary right to decide which individuals would get to keep their citizenship and which ones would not. It was particularly odious because it could be done capriciously and without any sort of procedural due process. There would be no capacity to appeal. There would be no capacity to bring new facts to the table.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237876">I know what members of the Conservative Party are ultimately going to say. They are going to say we would only be stripping citizenship from convicted terrorists. All we heard in the debate in the House from the previous minister and from my friends in the opposition is that at the end of the day once individuals are convicted of a particular crime, they should serve their time, and that is the ultimate sanction. Stripping citizenship from certain classes of individuals is not fundamentally appropriate. More important, it would undermine the whole concept of the fundamental principle of rule of law, where all citizens are treated equally. I note that concept was very well articulated earlier, and I want to reinforce that principle in my comments today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237877">These are really the fundamental issues of why I will be supporting Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document> in addition to the principles that were enunciated by the minister. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237878">My sense is that this is about what it means to be Canadian, what it ultimately means to create conditions where we are a welcoming society, as noted in the opening comments of the minister, a society that values people who come from around the world. My friend from <Affiliation DbId="213994" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> articulated the same principles. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237879">I do not agree with my friend from <Affiliation DbId="214396" Type="2">Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Affiliation> that somehow this is about an elevation of values. This is very much a values debate, but the value we are attaching is to the protection of fundamental principles, principles that are found in the charter, the principle of rule of law, the principle of equality. That is why we are here in this place. If we cannot protect those fundamental principles for the people we find most offensive in our society, then why are we here? That for me is the core of the debate and why Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document> must be supported.</ParaText>

We support that on the government side. The question is whether we create an additional penalty for certain classes of individuals. In this case, we are only talking about people who have a dual citizenship or the potential of a dual citizenship. Therefore, it can only be applied to certain people. From my perspective, that ultimately devalues the whole notion of equality of citizenship, which is much more fundamental.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237884">There are many other mechanisms that my friend has articulated in his question that I think allows us to deal with it, whether that be confiscation of passports or travel restrictions. There are other mechanisms that we can impose on these types of individuals, but again, it gets down to fundamental values. The concept of equality is paramount.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4237892">Madam Speaker, as an immigrant to this country, I fondly remember the day, July 17, 1987, when I became a Canadian citizen. It was one of the proudest days of my life and something I had dreamed about ever since I moved to Canada in January of 1984.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237893">This is my frame of reference in speaking in support of Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document>. I always understood Canada to be a country that welcomed refugees and immigrants and inspired them to strive to become Canadian citizens, to take that step toward full membership and permanent belonging in Canadian society. This is why Conservative Bill <Document DbId="6401990" Type="3">C-24</Document>, introduced in 2014 by the previous government, is so concerning to Canadians across Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237894">Even the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214466" Type="2">Calgary Forest Lawn</Affiliation>, a former parliamentary secretary and the longest continuously serving Conservative MP in the House, has publicly said that he has always opposed the bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237895">The member has been quoted as stating that he was “taken to task” by members of his own party for being one of the few MPs on that side of the House to vote against Bill C-24. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237896">Bill C-24 was an attempt by the Conservative Party to fundamentally change what it meant to be a Canadian as part of political branding exercise. The act created two classes of Canadians: those that only had Canadian citizenship and those who were at risk by having dual citizenship. Using their typical rhetoric of being tough on terrorism as justification, the Conservatives completely devalued what it meant to hold a Canadian passport. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237897">One of the most troubling aspects of the act is the way that Canadian citizenship could be so easily revoked. For example, convictions abroad that convinced a government official that an individual was a national security threat may prompt a process where Canadian citizenship could be stripped away. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237898">By no means does our government support citizens involved in terrorist offences, or espionage, or treason inside or outside of Canada's borders. However, this ability to remove citizenship from dual citizens is a problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237899"> First, a Canadian citizen without dual citizenship from another country could never have their passport revoked for the same crimes committed abroad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237900"> Second, it makes Canadian citizenship a tool for the criminal justice system. Punishment for crimes should be decided in courts of law, either in Canada or outside of Canada, but the possibility of losing one's Canadian passport as a form of punishment is completely inappropriate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237901"> Last, for the minister to have such wide discretionary powers in the review and revocation process is a complete breach of due process and fairness. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237902">There are also aspects of the Conservative's Bill C-24 that only serve to discourage immigrants from wanting to become Canadian citizens. Immigrants want to apply for Canadian citizenship are automatically treated with distrust. The act measures their loyalty and attachment to Canada by the days they were physically present in the country. As a result, thousands of immigrant applicants are forced to sacrifice academic and employment opportunities or family obligations abroad just so they do not put their citizenship application process in jeopardy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4237904">To the young man I met in November who was scared about travelling to the country of his dad's birth for fear of being targeted and arrested by a repressive government regime, I say that Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document> will remove the grounds for revocation of Canadian citizenship that relate to national security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237905">To the immigrant mother of two young children who came to my constituency office worried about what might happen to her application if she temporarily returned to her homeland to care for her sick mother, I say that Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document> will reduce the number of days that someone will have to be physically present in Canada before applying for citizenship, and that they will receive credit for the time they have spent in Canada before becoming a permanent resident.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237906">There was also a man who was very nervous about applying for citizenship for his quite elderly, sick mother, who struggled with English.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237907">When the <Affiliation DbId="214309" Type="4">Minister of Immigration</Affiliation> was giving his speech, I got a call from one of my constituents, Dawinder Mann. He came to this country many years ago as a refugee. His mother, sister, and all his brothers and children are settled here, but unfortunately his wife was not able to apply for Canadian citizenship. She is in a position where her country of origin will not issue her a passport. Now she is not able to pass the English requirement. She is 54. Therefore, she would not be able to get a passport either from Canada or her country of origin. Now her husband is very happy that his wife, Harjinder Mann, under the new legislation, in a year's time will be able to apply proudly for Canadian citizenship and be able to carry a Canadian passport.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4237909">I believe passionately in the power of Canadian citizenship.

The Canadian passport is sacred and highly sought after across the globe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237910">This is why using Canadian citizenship to fearmonger or as a means of control or simply as a political prop is so very wrong. As our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has said, and I say again, a Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian, and our <Affiliation DbId="214309" Type="4">Minister of Immigration</Affiliation> has also said that. This is why he brought Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document> forward, so that every Canadian can feel that a Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian.</ParaText>

The reckless Bill <Document DbId="6842344" Type="3">C-51</Document> passed by the previous government included offences of so-called terrorism. Part 3 of Bill C-51, which I call the “thought chill section”, deals with things placed on websites that might encourage “terrorism in general”. It could include a Che Guevara poster the way it is worded. Therefore, a person who is innocent, but might have dual citizenship, could be found guilty of a terrorism-related offence for something as innocuous as an image on a website. It is anti-democratic and wrong, and thank God the current government is bringing it down.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4237926">I am here to speak to Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document>. Unfortunately, one of the government's priorities is to restore the Canadian citizenship of terrorists who are filled with hatred towards Canada. They hate our country and they hate being Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237927">Like the vast majority of Canadians, I believe that citizenship is essential to the Canadian identity, especially since the passage of the Canadian Citizenship Act in 1947, which set out three requirements for citizenship applicants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237928">First, applicants must live in Canada for a certain period of time, so they can become familiar with their obligations, our customs, our laws, and our Canadian values.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237929">Second, for over six decades, the Canadian Citizenship Act has required applicants to be able to communicate in one of Canada's two official languages. There is a reason why citizenship is an essential sign of our community and national identity. To be a full member of a community, a person must at least have the ability to communicate with other members of that community. It is no coincidence that “communicate” and “community” come from the same root word.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237930">In a country as diverse as ours, it is essential that we have certain commonalities in order to be unified in our diversity. One of these essential commonalities is the ability to communicate in one of the two official languages. Obviously, there are a number of proud Canadians who do not currently speak one of the two official languages. However, since the Canadian Citizenship Act was passed in 1947, we have been encouraging them to work toward successfully meeting that goal and thus becoming full members of our community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237931">Third, the 1947 act requires a basic knowledge of Canada, our laws, customs, values, democratic institutions, and history because this great democracy did not happen by chance. Canada is far more than just a reflection of the world. </ParaText>

                <B>Hon. Jason Kenney:</B> Madam Speaker, we are ambitious for new Canadians, for all Canadians, to know what our identity is and how, through the struggle of generations, through the organic development of these remarkable parliamentary institutions, through the core values of our society, such as the rule of law, the equality of opportunity, and equality before the law, we managed to develop this country that is something of a model for the world. It did not happen by accident, and this country is far more than just some kind of a post-modern reflection of the world. It comes from a particular set of institutions and values that are incarnated in our laws, and we are ambitious for new Canadians to know that history.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4237935">Canada is maintaining the highest sustained levels of immigration in its history. In the past decade, Canada welcomed over 2.6 million new permanent residents and swore in over 1.6 million new Canadian citizens. That was during the prime ministership of the now member for <Affiliation DbId="20558" Type="2">Calgary Heritage</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237936">We are maintaining the highest per capita levels of immigration in the developed world. Some countries have aberrant years when they are a little higher, but on a sustained basis, what we are doing with respect to immigration in this country is unprecedented in our history and, indeed, in the modern history of the developed world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237937">I maintain that we cannot take for granted the success of our model of unity and diversity, that we must be very deliberate, intentional, about ensuring that there is unity in our diversity, that we do not end up replicating the failed experiences of certain other western countries which are struggling with problems of social exclusion, ethnic enclaves, ghettoization, often which become the precedent factors for radicalization, extremism, social discord, and even violence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237938">We must not, through happy talk, pretend that there are no challenges to maintain social cohesion. This is not and should not be considered an exclusively conservative value or idea. It was, after all, the late Prime Minister Mackenzie King who adopted the Citizenship Act in 1947 with these clear obligations for new Canadian citizens. It was former Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, who, in 1997, spoke in the chamber about the need for civic literacy as one of the factors to bind us together. What did he mean by civic literacy? He meant a certain common vocabulary about who we are as a people, about our institutions, about from whence we came.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237939">The citizenship program, the citizenship law, is designed, in principle, to help develop that sense of social cohesion, of common Canadian values. I reject categorically the notion of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> that there is no such thing as a common Canadian value. There is. This country, this culture, rejects completely the attitude of certain cultures around the world which treat women as property rather than people, for example. That is why, as minister of citizenship and immigration, I was proud to work with new Canadian communities.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="4237940">I was also proud to work with experts and departmental officials to renew the citizenship program by making legislative and administrative changes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237941">When I became the citizenship and immigration minister in 2008, I discovered that many new Canadian citizens could not speak even very basic French or English. They could not communicate with their fellow citizens. In a way, they were excluded from the Canadian community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237942">I discovered that even though they had received 100% on the exam to test their knowledge of Canada, some people knew very little about our country, because unscrupulous immigration consultants were selling the test answers to people who were applying for citizenship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237943">I also learned that there were networks that were helping people who did not live in Canada and had never lived in Canada to commit fraud. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4237944">They remained outside the country in tax havens but hired unscrupulous consultants to arrange for testing and fraudulent documentation for citizenship applications. That is appalling and unacceptable. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="4237945">We are a generous and open country and we simply ask for those who seek to join the Canadian family that they respect our basic laws, customs, know something of our country, and ideally are able to communicate in one of our languages. That is why we needed to reform the program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237946">One of the ways in which we did so was a modest expansion of the residency requirement in Canada from three out of four years to four out of six years. That still gave people a great deal of flexibility, one-third of the time spent outside of the country to address the kind of exigencies mentioned by the previous speaker. However, I do not think four years is an unreasonable request for people to develop a durable, meaningful attachment to this country. Four years was still the lowest threshold for residency to obtain citizenship of any major democracy in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237947"> Canadian citizenship should be the gold standard; it should not be the bargain basement of citizenship in the world. I do not think it is unreasonable to say 48 months is a period in which to develop a meaningful attachment to our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237948">With respect to the provision on declaring the intention to reside in Canada, the regulations and the legislation were absolutely clear that people who became Canadian citizens, having signed that declaration, who had to leave for any reason, would not be penalized, and their citizenship would not be revoked. We simply wanted them to consciously declare that their citizenship was not just about obtaining a Canadian passport as a political insurance package.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237949">Millions of Canadian citizens live abroad, including members of my family and most of our families. Most of them maintain a durable attachment to our country. However, regrettably many hundreds of thousands of them who the moment they obtained their Canadian passports left this country and have never come back. We can use politically correct happy talk to pretend this does not happen, but we all know that it does. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237950">We all know cases where we have had to organize massive evacuations for tens of thousands of people who had not lived in our country for years, who had not paid taxes to it, who had not contributed to it, but who pulled out their Canadian passport as a document of political convenience. I believe that passport represents far more. It represents a loyalty of Canada to the citizen and a reciprocal loyalty of the citizen to our country. It is not a document of convenience. It should never be that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237951">That is why we simply said to these applicants to please express to us that it was actually their intention to reside in Canada, their new country. We welcome them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237952"> I spoke as minister to citizenship judges who quite literally told me that they had seen people coming to take the oath at the ceremony with their bags packed. They were going directly from the ceremony to the airport to return to their countries of origin. That is not consistent with what we consider the sense of a durable connection to Canada. Therefore, I find it regrettable that the Liberals are eliminating this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237953">Perhaps what I find most regrettable in this is the perverse priority given by the government to the bill to restore citizenship to convicted terrorists. We have heard a lot of demagoguery from the government about the notion that the previous Bill <Document DbId="6401990" Type="3">C-24</Document> in the last Parliament created some ostensible two-tier Canadian citizenship. What complete rubbish. Ever since the 1947 Citizenship Act was adopted by Parliament, there has been a power to revoke citizenship or to renounce it. When people say that citizenship is irrevocable, they simply do not know the law. It is revocable in this and every other country and always has been.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4237954">In the original 1947 act, adopted by a Liberal government, among the grounds for the revocation of citizenship was the conviction for treason or acts of war against Canada. That was a provision in our law under multiple Liberal governments from 1947 until amendments to the Citizenship Act in 1976 when that was repealed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237955">Essentially, what we did in 2014 in Bill <Document DbId="6401990" Type="3">C-24</Document> was to re-establish the original Liberal law to say that if individuals violently hated our country we would take a conviction of their violent hatred as evidence of their voluntary, wilful, and deliberate renunciation of the obligations implicit in their Canadian citizenship. That is what that provision, to be repealed in Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document>, permitted us to do, under judicial review and in compliance with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237956">I mentioned a case that was immediately dismissed, because they do not want to address this issue. It was dismissed out of hand. However, I would invite any member and anyone viewing this to go on line and simply Google “Canadian burning passport in Syria”. They will get two or three images of Canadians who have travelled to join a group. It is not just some group of militants, but a genocidal terrorist organization that has declared hostility and war on Canada and inspired an attack on this very Parliament. It is crucifying children, beheading members of religious minorities, and raping girls as young as eight. They have gone to join that organization, whose membership is illegal in Canada. In more than one of those images we can see these “Canadians” burning and shooting their Canadian passports. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237957">The position of the members opposite appears to be that, if those men who are clearly expressing their violent hatred for Canada were to download a form from CIC's website to renounce their citizenship, fill out the form, sign it, put it in an envelope, and send it to Ottawa, they could therefore renounce their citizenship. That is a terribly cramped and legalistic view of the facts and of citizenship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237958"> I am sorry, but if individuals deliberately go and join an organization at war with Canada—parenthetically, committing genocide—destroy their Canadian passports as a clear indication of their renunciation of those passports and the citizenship they symbolize, we should have no compunction about saying we read their actions for what they are, they constitute renunciation, and we will renounce their citizenship if they are engaged in such acts of terrorism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237959">The member for <Affiliation DbId="214382" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation>, for whom I have great respect, raised a completely ridiculous, demagogic argument. This is not about having a sign of Che Guevara on a website requiring a conviction in a Canadian court of a terrorist offence or treason that would carry at least a two-year penal sentence. No one in the history of our legal system has faced a terrorist conviction of two years for expressing views. This is about violent terrorism. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237960">What the government is telling us in the bill is that someone can take up arms against our country, so violently do they hate it, like that man in Toronto whose citizenship has been revoked. He was the ringleader of a plot that planned to kill thousands of his fellow citizens in an act of extreme political violence, to demonstrate his violent hatred for our country. In so doing, he renounced his citizenship. He did so through his volition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237961">The power of revocation simply reflects the volition of those who renounce it violently through such acts of treason or terrorism. The power of revocation does not apply to immigrants versus native-born citizens, as the demagogues in this debate have implied. The only reason it is limited to dual citizens in this application is our legal obligation under the international convention on the prevention of statelessness. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237962">Therefore, I appeal to the members opposite and around this place to think seriously about the meaning of our citizenship and to oppose the provisions of the bill. </ParaText>

I do not know if the evocation of the idea of killing Canadians with drones was really what he was reaching for or suggesting in the Canadian context.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237974">My question is twofold. One part is a question about the values in the Citizenship Act of 1947 and the idea that those values are somehow in a fixed and permanent state. We did not allow first nations people to vote in elections in 1947, so Canadian values can evolve and progress over time, and clearly do.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4237976">In the instance of Canadian citizens committing one of these acts, particularly here in Canada, is it not better to arrest them, as the law in Canada provides for, rather than to revoke their citizenship and send them into a conflict zone, which is likely where they would be going, and thus allow them to further perpetrate those very heinous acts that we all deplore? Is there not an argument to be made at times that if someone is a dual citizen and has committed an act either abroad or here in Canada, the arresting of that person and the containing of that hatred would be a more beneficial circumstance than simply sending the problem overseas for someone else to deal with?</ParaText>

Following what is called an “equivalency assessment” by the Department of Justice, if that offence is determined to be an offence in a legitimate court system with adequate evidence and would constitute a serious offence here, citizenship could be revoked without that person ever coming back to Canada. Take for example the fellows who were over there and burned their passports. That would be the kind of example I am citing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237980">Moreover, if the person is in Canada, the revocation of that individual's citizenship would in no way obviate their arrest and prosecution and conviction and incarceration under Canadian law. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237981">Here I would mention the Toronto 16 ringleader, who is about to get out on parole. I would rather have him under the watch of another country's security system than potentially posing a risk to us here in Canada.</ParaText>

To be clear, the bill in front of the House would restore a two-tier citizenship, because it would provide for revocation of citizenship only for immigrants. It would return us to the system that we used to have in place. Revocation would not be allowed for people who were born here but only for immigrants to this country who have become naturalized and hold a second citizenship. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237983">Liberal members of Parliament need to be clear on this. We would be going to a two-tier citizenship with the bill in front of the House.

              <ParaText id="4237984">Madam Speaker, the member is absolutely correct. Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document> leaves untouched the 1976 revocation provisions for those naturalized citizens who obtained their Canadian citizenship through misrepresentation. This would include, for example, the Nazi war criminals who did not disclose their participation in crimes against humanity in applying for and obtaining their Canadian citizenship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237985">However, I who was born in this country could never have my citizenship revoked under the provisions of the bill, but an immigrant could. The member is absolutely right: if we want to play the game about two-tier citizenship, it applies far more clearly to Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document> than it did to Bill <Document DbId="6401990" Type="3">C-24</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4237986">My father was a fourth generation Canadian who had an Irish passport. He had dual citizenship. If he had joined the IRA, heaven forbid, and been convicted of that, with a penal sentence of two years, even though he was a native-born Canadian, he could have had his citizenship revoked. However, immigrants to Canada from India or China, for example, who automatically lose the citizenship of their country of origin in being naturalized to Canada could never have their citizenship revoked under the provisions of Bill <Document DbId="6401990" Type="3">C-24</Document>, because it excluded its application to people who did not have dual nationality pursuant to our obligations under the international Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4238024">Madam Speaker, on February 24, Michael Phelan, a Federal Court judge in British Columbia, ruled that a regulation on medical marijuana that had been implemented by the former Conservative government was unconstitutional. The federal government now has six months to change the rules.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4238025">However, when I questioned the <Affiliation DbId="214321" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> and got a response from the <Affiliation DbId="214673" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice</Affiliation> on February 25, my question went unanswered. The Liberals had no position on whether they would comply with the ruling and allow people who need medical marijuana to grow the plants themselves at home for their own treatment. We did not get an answer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4238026">According to Justice Phelan, the health and safety of consumers diminished when they were limited to purchasing from licensed producers. The over 100-page document says that “access to cannabis for medical purposes [has] not improved” since the Conservatives' decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4238027">The NDP's position on medical marijuana is consistent with the Federal Court's ruling. The NDP has always supported the use of medical marijuana.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4238028">The Conservatives, meanwhile, chose to play politics with this issue of access to marijuana by imposing regulations to restrict access, which limits people's options and increases costs. We hope that the Liberals will not take the same path.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4238029">On a slightly more general note, we are still waiting for the Liberals to consult medical experts, patients, and advocacy groups on this issue. We expect the Liberals to keep the promises they made during the election campaign, and for years before that, to legalize marijuana.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4238030">Every time we asked the question, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> always said that it would happen during the first year. Contrary to what the Prime Minister said, the <Affiliation DbId="214673" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice</Affiliation> is saying that it probably will not happen during this government's first term, so perhaps not before the next federal election. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4238031">The government is improvising and creating uncertainty. Even police authorities are wondering what they are supposed to do. There are young people right now who have criminal records for simple possession, and it makes no sense. The burden is too heavy for Canadians. Giving someone a criminal record for simple possession is not the goal, nor will it do anything to tackle the drug trafficking that is happening right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4238032">Furthermore, enforcing the prohibition brought in by the Conservatives will not eradicate organized crime, curb young people's access to the drug, or ensure any kind of control over quality.</ParaText>

He said that it was our government's intention to legalize, regulate, and restrict marijuana. We set our goals on the protection of our children, to reduce and restrict access that children have to this drug, because the overwhelming evidence of the science is that marijuana can be a very unhealthy thing for developing minds in adolescence and young adults. We want to protect our children and believe that can be done far more effectively through a regulatory regime than through criminal sanction.</ParaText>

I can say from experience, having worked in many of our disadvantaged communities, that the level of violence and victimization that takes place in those communities as a direct result of the illegal activity around marijuana takes a terrible toll on those communities. We believe that a strictly regulatory regime based on a public health model will protect our communities, as well as protect our children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4238040">We believe that a public health approach will enable this country to assure all Canadians in all communities that marijuana can be made available legally to responsible adults, but that its production, distribution, retail, and consumption would be controlled by regulation to ensure that we can achieve both our public safety aims and public health aims. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4238041">Now the member opposite has also asked the very important question of when this will be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4238042">Our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said that he would begin this work right away, and the work has begun. I have been given direction by my minister to be the government's liaison on this initiative. Our minister has indicated that she is establishing a federal-provincial-territorial task force responsible for the development of these regulations based on research and evidence. That task force is currently being assembled, and I am hoping for an opportunity in the coming weeks to advise the House of the progress we have made.</ParaText>

Will it be this year? Will it be during the next election? That is what people are confused about right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4238044">As the parliamentary secretary said, this could take a while because there are consultations and research to be done. In the meantime, young people or others who use marijuana for personal use could be arrested by the police. Given that marijuana is still outlawed, those people could end up with a criminal record. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4238048">On the issue of decriminalization, I will be very clear. We rely on evidence and the advice of experts. A report by the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto has indicated that decriminalization is a half measure that will do nothing to reduce the social harms of marijuana, that it does not protect our kids, that it does not take away the profit from organized crime, and that it does not facilitate a robust public health response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4238049">The evidence of other jurisdictions has told us that ineffective half measures, such as decriminalization, will only complicate and undermine the implementation of an effective regulatory regime that will achieve our public health and public safety goals.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4238050">Madam Speaker, during question period on January 27, I asked the minister what action she was planning to take to ensure compliance with the Canada Health Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4238051">Quebec has legalized ancillary fees for public health services even though this practice violates the Canada Health Act. It is unacceptable that people's finances should determine their access to health care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4238052">In November, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="214102" Type="2">Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie</Affiliation> wrote to the minister to inform her about this situation, and I have risen twice in the House to ask the minister what the federal government is going to do to put a stop to this practice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4238053">The minister did reply to the letter, but she did not say a word about ancillary health fees even though her mandate letter clearly states that her “overarching goal will be to strengthen our publicly funded universal health care system”. To me, strengthening a universal health care system does not mean forcing patients to pay $500 for the use of instruments involved in performing a colonoscopy. Allowing ancillary fees results in unequal access to medical services, and the federal government should intervene to stop this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4238054">If we take a look at some of the ancillary fees that are being charged, we can see some alarming figures: $40 for the application of a four-square-centimetre bandage following a minor surgery, $200 for the insertion of an IUD, $500 for the use of instruments. One need only take a quick glance at the Canada Health Act to know that such practices are against the law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4238055">The law specifically states that provincial and territorial health insurance plans must provide coverage for all medical and hospital services that are medically necessary. Charging ancillary fees for health care services clearly violates the principle of fair and universal health care coverage. In this specific case, the Canada Health Act is not being enforced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4238056">What is more, this system has encouraged health processionals to adopt practices that go against the principles of equity and universality. For example, some doctors' offices charge $300 for $20 eye drops, or $150 just to create a file. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4238057">In some cases, the legalization of ancillary fees has led some doctors to violate their code of ethics. This measure violates the principle of equity and is misleading for Quebeckers. We need to stand up for the principle of a free, accessible, and universal health care system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4238058">Allow me to recap. Quebeckers are becoming poorer as a result of the legalization of ancillary fees. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Canada ranks second in pharmaceutical expenditures per capita. This affects everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4238059">This measure affects the quality of life and the health of citizens. In this case, there is a huge gap between the rich and the poor. No one should have to choose between getting treatment and paying rent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4238060">In addition, there is a risk that other provinces could adopt this plan, which would lead to interprovincial medical tourism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4238061">This measure is helping create a two-tier health care system. I ask my colleague once again: what will the minister do to ensure that the public health care system is accessible from coast to coast to coast?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4238062">Madam Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to address my colleague's concerns about the federal government's commitment to Canada's health care system and to the Canada Health Act. I am pleased to have the opportunity to comment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4238063">Let me begin by assuring members that the government is fully committed to protecting our publicly funded health care system and will defend the fundamental tenet that all Canadians should have reasonable access to medically necessary care based on need and not the ability to pay. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4238064">In fact, the fear that user charges and extra billing would erode access to needed medical care and lead to a two-tier health care system was the major motivation in the development of the Canada Health Act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4238065">Prior to the act, many Canadian families were left to pay doctor and hospital bills out of pocket. Those who were able to pay received the medical attention they needed, but those without sufficient means either did not get the required care or struggled to find the money to pay for it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4238066">Essentially, the Canada Health Act was brought into force to protect the basic values of fairness and equity that are fundamental to the Canadian identity. The act sets out national standards for provincial and territorial health insurance schemes and promotes these standards by linking federal health funding to them. Our government stands by these national standards and will continue to uphold this commitment to all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4238067">If physicians charge patients a fee when providing an insured service in their clinics, these charges will contravene the Canada Health Act and will strike at the core principles of public health insurance in Canada. The basic principle of access to health care based on need and not financial ability would be disregarded. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4238068">Canadians not only want and expect their governments to work together to preserve, modernize, and strengthen publicly funded health care in Canada but also want them to protect it. Let me again emphasize that it is our government's desire to work in collaboration with the provinces and territories to ensure our publicly funded health care system is strong and that Canadians have access to the care they need, when they need it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4238069">Some of our greatest achievements as a country, the things that matter most in the daily lives of Canadians, came about when federal, provincial, and territorial governments worked together to forge solutions to complex problems. Medicare is a perfect example of this co-operation and collaboration. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4238070">Our government will continue to provide this critical leadership and has already taken the first steps by re-engaging with the provinces and territories. Our health care system represents the best of Canadian federalism. It is flexible enough to respond to the different regional needs, while protecting the national principles that Canadians hold dear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4238071">That is why I say with absolute certainty that our government has always defended medicare and will continue to do so. Canadians should have full confidence in our government's determination and ability to uphold the principles of the Canada Health Act. Working with the provinces and territories, our goal is to ensure that Canadians continue to have access to high quality care, regardless of their ability to pay.</ParaText>
