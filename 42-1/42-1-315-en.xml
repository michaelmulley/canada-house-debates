              <ParaText id="5494249">Mr. Speaker, I have the pleasure of tabling the party's dissenting report for the study on economic security completed by the Standing Committee on the Status of Women. As Conservatives, we know that there are many ways to be a successful woman and it is up to each woman herself to choose the path to her success, which is why economic choice is the greatest measure of equality and something that every government should strive for. Women deserve the freedom to work where they choose, be that on the farm, in the office, in the classroom, at home, et cetera. It is the woman's choice, and it is not up to the government to dictate this to her.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494250">Women are strong and capable. They are able to make these decisions for themselves, and they are able to make them in conjunction with their family members. Autonomy must be granted; freedom must be protected; and choice must be respected. This is what women expect from every government, and this one is no exception, despite the fact that the Liberals think they can dictate these things to women in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494251">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has said that poverty is sexist. In saying this, he has said that poverty disproportionately impacts women and impacts them in a very negative way. Here is the interesting thing. This is the same government that is imposing a carbon tax, and the carbon tax will impact the well-being of women. Let us consider in particular single mothers who are responsible for driving their children to sports practices, dance classes, school, et cetera. These women will now be paying an additional 11¢ per litre on the gasoline that they put in their vehicles in order to go to the places they need to go in order to be good moms. All of this feeds into their ability to economically support themselves and their families. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494252">It is the government that is putting the carbon tax in place. Furthermore, we have asked the government how much the carbon tax is going to cost Canadian families. We would love to know how much it is going to cost a single mom who is working hard to raise her family. The government has hidden that information not only from us on this side of the House, but from all Canadians. Liberals are saying that this is good for Canada, but it is going to ruin lives. It is going to make life less affordable. It is going to prevent people from being able to pay their bills and do the things that are necessary for daily life. The government needs to do more to advance the economic security of women, instead of disadvantaging them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494253">I agree with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> that poverty is sexist, and he is perpetuating it. </ParaText>

We have 3,800 Canada Post outlets that already exist in rural and remote areas, where there are few or no banks. These outlets are perfectly capable of conducting financial transactions. The petitioners ask the Government of Canada to enact my motion, Motion No. 166, which would create a committee to study and propose a plan for postal banking under Canada Post Corporation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5494289">Mr. Speaker, measures were urgently developed over a five-month period due to the unprecedented North Atlantic right whale mortality event that occurred in 2017. They take into account the best available science and input from stakeholders, partners, experts, and indigenous peoples. Closures will reduce fishing effort and could impact communities, but the survival of the species is tied to the long-term economic well-being of Canada’s coastal communities. As a result, in-depth economic analysis of the impact of the new management measures on the New Brunswick lobster fishing industry and overall New Brunswick economy did not occur. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494290">The fishing area closed on April 28 in the Gulf of St. Lawrence region could affect up to 200 lobster harvesters and covers approximately 196 km2 or 4.9% of the entire lobster fishing ground in lobster fishing area, LFA, 23C. Each fish harvester has 300 traps. By imposing the closure, there is a potential reduction of up to 60,000 vertical lines in the water in an area where North Atlantic right whale concentration was observed in 2017. Since the season opening, unofficial LFA 23 landings are between 350 pounds per day, for LFA 23 D, and up to 1,000 pounds per day, for LFA 23 A, B, and C, which are typical to above average from previous years. Thus far, the impacts of the closure have been limited. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494291">The targeted fisheries management measures being applied demonstrate Canada’s commitment to protecting this species, which is both mandated under the Canadian Species at Risk Act and critical to meeting the new import provisions under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act.

              <ParaText id="5494327"> We inherited this place from our British ancestors, who gathered in the fields of Runnymede to force King John to sign the Magna Carta. Among the demands made by what we today would call “citizens” but then were called “subjects” was that the crown could not levy funds for which there had not been provided general consent. In other words, King John and his predecessors had plundered the people in order to fund endless foreign wars and costly ventures, and had done so without the consent of the people actually paying the bills. From that grew a principle that would eventually be called in American terms “no taxation without representation”. In other words, the government cannot tax what legislatures do not approve. That principle remains here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494328">As members know, governments are banned from levying any tax or in fact making any expenditures before it is approved by this here, a gathering of the commoners. It is not enough for the Senate, which historically represented the aristocracy, to make that approval. It does not represent the common people who pay those costs. We do. We are the representatives of the commoners, and that is why we are here in the House of Commons standing, as we are, on this green carpet representing the fields from which the original commoners came and for whose consent we are the ones delegated to provide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494329">Before the House of Commons at present is a budget bill that would levy a new tax, a carbon tax. That tax would apply to any good that uses fossil fuels in their production or transport to bring it to consumers. As a result, the tax will raise the cost of almost every consumer good people buy, not only those products that are directly made with fossil fuels but those that are transported or produced by those fuels. Not only will our gas prices, home heating prices, and other fuel costs rise, but our groceries, which come by truck and train, will also become expensive. Consumer goods like furniture and clothing, which also have to be transported to retail outlets, will become more expensive. The government will collect the revenues on those increased costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494330"> However, unlike other taxes, the costs were not itemized for everyday Canadians. If we pay income tax, we file and we find out what we pay. If we pay HST, we look at our bill and we see how much tax formed part of our purchase price. Therefore, Canadians can generally, if imprecisely, calculate what each tax is costing them. Carbon taxes are far more insidious. Their costs are embedded inside the products and services that people buy but they are not itemized on any receipt. Therefore, if grocers raise the costs of fresh fruits and vegetables to feed our kids, we might assume that they are to blame, when in fact they are not behind the cost increase; rather, it is the government and its carbon tax that is causing that price inflation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494331"> The government is proposing to move forward with this tax to embed all of these price increases in the purchases that Canadians make without telling them what it would cost. One defence it might otherwise have made for this secrecy is that it does not know what it would cost. However, that is not true. I have obtained numerous documents, which I have attempted to table in this House, in which the government has calculated the costs. It says that it has tables in which the costs for the average household is calculated, yet it blacks out the numbers, denying Parliament the information it needs in order to vote on this budget bill.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5494332">I spoke earlier about the principle of no taxation without representation. Well, there can be no representation without information. The government cannot tax what Parliament does not approve, but Parliament cannot approve what it does not know. Therefore, there can be no taxation without information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494333"> The government has that information but refuses to release it. Why? What is the motivation for keeping all of this secret? I think it is the same motivation that a high-priced retailer has when trying to sell an excessively expensive product. They do not put the price on a product, but ask that a person bring the item up to the front and make a psychological decision to buy it. Only after, when one has one's credit card out, does one find out what it costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494334"> My experience is that when I walk through a retail outlet and there is a product that does not have a price tag on it, it is because it is too expensive and I cannot afford it. That may well be why the government is trying to sell the carbon tax without telling people what it will cost them. Even worse, unlike the retailer who at some point prior to the transaction must reveal the cost, in this case, the Liberals do not even propose to reveal the cost after the purchase is made. In other words, people will be paying sums of money to the government without even knowing they are doing it, because those sums are buried in literally millions of products and services that Canadians buy every week and every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494335">We, on this side of this House as Her Majesty’s loyal opposition, cannot countenance this violation of our ancient right to know what the government costs us. That is why I am announcing today that we have put forward over 200 motions to object to the spending bill the government has just tabled before the House. We will keep the government here voting for as long as 30 hours until it releases every single document it has since the last federal election indicating what this tax will cost the average Canadian family. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494336">I notice that we have a very enthusiastic group of Conservatives here who are prepared to stand and do their duty, to stand and defend taxpayers, to stay here all night if they have to, and stay as long as necessary to defend the people they represent. However, there is no enthusiasm on that side of the House of Commons. I hear nothing but deafening silence, and I see nothing but glum faces. Many of the backbenchers on that side are actually decent and conscientious people, but I am sure members will forgive me for saying that they feel no comfort in watching their privileged front bench cover up the facts from their constituents. I know that they will find it miserable to sit there and vote time after time to protect the secrecy of the front bench as it moves forward with this new, insidious, secretive tax. We know that the Liberals have a majority, but we will use our numbers, such as they are, the strong mandate of the official opposition that we have been given, to make it as difficult as possible for the government to pull off this rip-off. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494337">If members want any proof that this is anything but a tax grab, look at how the Liberals are taxing the tax. They propose to impose the GST not just on products people buy but on the carbon tax cost of those products. Let us say that a Canadian buys some furniture at a furniture store, just like any other middle-class suburban family would do to furnish their home. Of course, the furniture would be subject to a goods and services tax, but there is also another tax hidden within the cost of that furniture, and that is the cost of the carbon tax that has been borne by those who produced the furniture and then transported the furniture. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="30">(1030)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5494338"> All of those costs get transferred to the customer. The customer always gets the cost passed down. The government not only proposes that the GST should apply to the furniture but also to the carbon tax cost on that furniture. In other words, it is a tax on a tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494339">The Parliamentary Budget Officer says that in the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia alone the federal government will collect a quarter billion dollars in GST on the carbon tax. Imagine what those costs would be right across the country in the form of GST on the carbon tax. Canadians are being forced to pay a tax for the privilege of paying another tax. I asked the government about this and it said this is how the GST works. According to the government, it applies to all the goods and services Canadians buy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494340">Is the carbon tax a good or a service? I am not sure it is any good except in being of service to the government's plan to take more money from everyday taxpayers. As my friend to the left of me said, it is a disservice to everybody else.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494341">We are calling on the government to release all the documents in its possession. I know the government will try to get out of this voting session tonight by coming up with some phony number that it will invent at the eleventh hour in order to let all of its MPs go home. I want to be very specific about this. We want every single document produced by every single department that calculates the cost of the carbon tax to every single Canadian that has been produced since the last election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494342">There is no reason why the government cannot do this. We are not looking for commercially sensitive information. What commercial sensitivity could possibly exist in telling people what they are going to have to pay? There is no national security reason the government should not do this, although ironically, the government might go so far as to make an argument for such exemptions. It did use an exemption under an access to information request, that it says in the act that revealing to Canadians the cost of the carbon tax would imperil the government's ability to manage the economy. That was the exemption the government used in the existing Access to Information Act in order to justify withholding information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494343">Not only will the carbon tax that the Liberals have designed damage the economy, mere knowledge of its cost could be damaging to the government's ability to administer the economy, according to the government. Let us be realistic here. If the carbon tax is going to damage the economy, keeping its cost secret is not going to mitigate those damages. That excuse does not work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494344">The Liberals say the carbon tax is a provincial policy, that it has nothing to do with them, so they cannot possibly release any information on it. Bill <Document DbId="9727472" Type="3">C-74</Document> is a federal government bill introduced in the House of Commons to impose a carbon tax at a national level. If it were simply a provincial issue, we would not need federal legislation, so therefore it is a federal issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494345">Then the Liberals say some of these numbers are outdated, that they go back two years. They claim the whole world has changed in two years, so members do not need that crazy old data; they will keep it to themselves. Well, if it is so old, just release it and explain to Canadians why it is not applicable anymore. They should just say the numbers are very high and that they will damage the middle-class Canadian household. They should just tell us that there is no reason to worry because it is old information and it is no longer relevant, that they have new information with which to replace it, and that they will let Canadians look at all those facts and in their wisdom decide who to believe. That objection does not work.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5494346">I am very curious to hear throughout the day specific justifications from members of the government for keeping these costs secret. Even those who support a carbon tax should be in favour of telling people what it costs. If it is worth what it costs, then why not provide those costs and justify them in making the case? However, the government will not do that. It wants to keep those costs secret because if the costs become known, then one of the claims the government has made will be disproven. It has claimed that the carbon tax is going to be revenue neutral. To be revenue neutral the government would have to tell people what it is collecting and what people are paying in the first place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494347">How can we believe the Liberals are going to neutralize a cost if we do not know what that cost is? If they were really going to neutralize the effect on middle- and working-class households of this new tax, they would first need to say, “Here's what it costs and here's what you're getting back in some other tax reduction”. However, they will not do that because this is not revenue neutral. The reason we know that is because I specifically asked officials with Environment Canada and Finance Canada at the committee whether the government would use the proceeds of the tax to lower other taxes, in other words to let people keep more through income tax savings in order to compensate them for what extra they pay in carbon taxes. The officials in both those departments confirmed that the government intends to do no such thing. It will not use the revenues to reduce any other tax. In fact, it will use these revenues in order to spend more money. That is the Liberals' definition of revenue neutral. If Canadians send it, they will spend it. Saying they are going to raise a tax, but not to worry, they will spend every penny, is not revenue neutral. It is a tax grab.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494348">We know we cannot trust the government on money. Just yesterday, I stood up in the House of Commons and quoted a Fraser Institute study showing that 81% of middle-class Canadians are paying more income tax today than when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took office. The Prime Minister stood up and said, “That's not what the report said at all. Come on”. It turns out he had similar denials on the floor of the House of Commons, and he had so offended the report's authors that they actually took what is perhaps the unprecedented step of asking newspapers to run a guest column where they could correct the Prime Minister and point out that indeed Canadian middle-class taxpayers are paying more because of the policies of the Prime Minister, which is exactly the opposite of what he promised in the last election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494349">After I disproved his claim about the report, he stood up and said, “Okay, Liberals have raised taxes, but they've just taken away boutique tax credits from rich people”. By rich people he means anyone who used the public transit tax credit to take the bus. If someone takes the bus they are too rich for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. He takes a limousine; they take the bus. Taxpayers who used the children's fitness tax credit to put their kids in soccer and hockey are too rich, according to the Prime Minister, and they deserve a tax increase. Students who used the textbook tax credit to buy their expensive books in order to learn are too rich according to the Prime Minister, and according to him they deserve a tax increase. All of this is just a bit rich coming from our trust fund millionaire Prime Minister, who has never once raised taxes on himself. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494350">On this side of the House, we will continue to stand up for working-class taxpayers to give them the chance to earn a better life and keep more of what they earn. We believe in putting people before government, a principle that is 800 years old, a principle that helped inspire the very creation of the parliamentary system in which we operate and debate today, and in which we will stand and vote hour after hour for the rights of taxpayers tonight. </ParaText>

And if it stops moving, subsidize it.” That is what we have today: a government that has so weighed down our energy sector with rules, regulations, uncertainty, and taxes, that it is not economical for it to build a pipeline with its own money. Therefore, the government has to build it with other people's money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494358">We know governments are not particularly good at this. The government paid more money for this pipeline project than anyone in the marketplace was prepared to pay. In other words, it obviously paid more than the market value. The government paid twice as much as the seller said was the book value of the project, and that is just to buy a pipeline that has existed since 1953. The $4.5 billion purchase price does not build a single centimetre of new pipeline capacity. This is a government bailout quickly transforming into a government boondoggle.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5494372">I will defend the government very little on its climate plan. It does not have a plan and had very few promises in the Liberal platform, but one of them was carbon pricing. Therefore, clearly it has public support to bring in carbon pricing. The NDP, the Greens, and the Liberals ran on policies for carbon pricing of different sorts, and that was by far the majority of voters.

Of all of the ways to address climate change, this was probably the worst one. It will end up sending billions of dollars to California and other jurisdictions in trading of carbon credits. It will ultimately create a new class of investment bankers and insiders who will make a fortune.

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="234563" Type="18">Mr. Joël Lightbound (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5494377">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to speak to the motion moved by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214462" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>. This gives me the opportunity to talk about what our government is doing to support the economy and protect the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494378">Maintaining a strong economy and fighting climate change are important priorities to us and to Canadians. We share their concerns. With the possible exception of the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214462" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>, Canadians know that there is a cost to pollution. Canadians also know that droughts, floods, and weather have an adverse effect not only on health, but also on the vitality of our economy. A healthy, sustainable economy favours growth and job creation to the benefit of the middle class. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494379">Unlike the previous government, our government does not intend to stand idly by. We have made major investments in order to protect the quality of Canada's air, water, and natural areas. We want to ensure that future generations can still walk in the woods and swim in our magnificent lakes and rivers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494380"> Therefore, to date, our government has allocated $5.7 billion over 12 years in support of the implementation of the pan-Canadian framework on clean growth and climate change. This plan was developed with the provinces and territories and in consultation with indigenous peoples. It will ensure a healthy environment for future generations and support a strong, clean economy. It will also foster innovation and create good, well-paying jobs for the middle class.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494381">Let me remind the House of some of its measures. As a first step in the framework, budget 2016 provided nearly $3 billion over five years to address the effects of climate change and reduce air pollution. In the 2017 budget, the government allocated additional significant investments in green infrastructure and public transit. On top of that, nearly $1.5 billion in new financing was made available to help Canada's clean technology firms grow and expand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494382"> More recently, budget 2018 proposed one of the most significant investments in nature conservation in Canadian history, to protect our ecosystems and biodiversity. In partnership with the provinces, territories, and indigenous peoples, this plan will help preserve 17% of Canada's interior and inland waters. The pan-Canadian framework on clean growth and climate change supports Canada's vision to reduce greenhouse gases by 30% over 2005 levels by 2030, while allowing us to adapt to and build resilience for climate change, which is very real, as we know; its effects are being felt across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494383">To achieve this goal, the key element of our action plan is to put a tax on carbon pollution across the country, because this is effective. It will help us reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to do so at a low cost to businesses and consumers. By focusing on development and new choices to enable Canadians to reduce their carbon footprint, we can stimulate innovation. At the end of the day, we will all benefit from increased economic growth and cleaner growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494384">The pan-Canadian framework on clean growth and climate change was developed in collaboration with the provincial and territorial governments, and most provinces support it. A clean environment and a clean economy go hand in hand. That is what we have said and we believe it. Our efforts to tackle climate change are part of our plan to grow the economy and strengthen the middle class. The 2018 budget tabled earlier this year by the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, whom I am fortunate to work with, is doing even more to help Canadians. The new Canada workers benefit will let low-income workers keep more money in their pockets. This will encourage more people to join the labour force and will provide concrete assistance to more than two million Canadians who are working hard to join the middle class. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494385">The Canada child benefit will also be enhanced. Benefits will be increased annually to keep pace with the cost of living starting in July of this year, which is two years earlier than planned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494386">We are able to do it this year because of Canada's sustained economic growth. By providing more money to families who need it most, this benefit provides a new opportunity for Canadian families. We should also not forget our efforts on behalf of small businesses, who, as we know, create most of the jobs in Canada. We reduced the small business tax to 10% effective January 1 and will be reducing it to 9% next January 1. This represents savings of up to $7,500 a year to help Canadian entrepreneurs and innovators.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5494387">The negative impacts of climate change are a challenge that governments must grapple with. We do so with the confidence that a strong economy and a clean environment go hand in hand. Canadians expect all governments to take serious action to grow the economy, protect the environment, and address climate change. We are taking action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494388">Putting a price on carbon pollution is central to Canada's plan to fight climate change and grow the economy. Carbon pricing is broadly recognized as one of the most effective, transparent, and efficient policy approaches to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494389">In December 2016, our government, along with most provinces and territories, worked with indigenous partners and adopted the pan-Canadian framework on clean growth and climate change. The framework includes a pan-Canadian approach to pricing carbon pollution, with the aim of having carbon pricing in place in all provinces and territories. The framework provides provinces and territories with the flexibility to implement their own carbon pollution pricing systems. They can choose between an explicit price-based system or a cap and trade system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494390">The member for <Affiliation DbId="214462" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> keeps talking about price hikes. Let me reassure him that the direct cost of the actions in the pan-Canadian framework, including carbon pricing, is projected to be modest, particularly in comparison to the projected benefits. All direct revenues related to carbon pricing will be returned to the jurisdiction of origin. Of course, the precise cost will depend on the design of each provincial or territorial carbon pricing system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494391">To ensure that a fair price on carbon pollution is in place across Canada, our government has committed to implementing a federal backstop carbon-pollution pricing system. The backstop system would apply in provinces and territories that request it and in jurisdictions that do not have a pricing system in place that meets the federal standard by the end of this year. In such cases, the cost of carbon pollution in the federal backstop system will be set at $20 per tonne of emissions as of January 1, 2019, and the federal system will return direct revenues from the carbon price to the jurisdiction of origin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494392">That said, we cannot measure the cost of carbon pricing without also measuring its benefits. Those benefits are important, such as reducing air and water pollution and their harmful effects on human health and on the environment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494393">At the risk of repeating myself, a strong economy and a clean environment go hand in hand. That is why this year's budget proposed further measures to help grow a healthy and sustainable clean economy. For example, budget 2018 includes one of the most significant investments in nature conservation in Canadian history, more than $1.3 billion over five years. This will ensure that future generations can continue to hike in our forests and swim in our lakes and rivers. This will also allow us to enhance the protection of Canada's ecosystems, landscapes, and biodiversity, including species at risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494394"> Our government is also investing about $1 billion over five years to establish better rules for the review of major projects, an effort that, all at once, aims to protect our environment, rebuild public trust, and help create new jobs and economic opportunities. This builds on the other significant investments made since we took office. For example, budget 2017 included historic investments in green infrastructure and public transit as well as increased support for the Canadian clean-tech sector. Budget 2017 provided up-and-coming companies with increased funding in the form of business equity, working capital, and project funds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494395">The low carbon economy leadership fund, launched in 2017, is investing $1.4 billion in projects that will generate clean growth and reduce greenhouse gas emissions while creating jobs for Canadians for years to come. In Ontario, where the member for <Affiliation DbId="214462" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> is from, almost $420 million will be invested to support Ontario's climate change action plan and help Ontarians contribute to fighting climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494396">In Alberta, where the member grew up, and I am sure where he has many friends, almost $150 million will be used to support provincial climate objectives. Alberta's projects will focus on helping Albertans, including farmers and ranchers, use less energy and save money. The province will also invest in restoring forests affected by wildfires.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="5494397">In Quebec, over $260 million will help expand action under the province's 2013-2020 climate change action plan.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5494398">The list goes on, with projects in British Columbia, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. It is important to note that only provinces and territories that sign on to the pan-Canadian framework for clean growth and climate change are eligible for funding under the low carbon economy leadership fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494399"> I just spent a bit of time highlighting the measures announced in 2017 and 2018, but this really started in 2016. That year, our government launched a $1.5 billion national oceans protection plan to improve marine safety and responsible shipping, protect Canada's marine environment, and unlock new opportunities for indigenous and coastal communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494400">So far, to combat climate change, our government has already allocated $5.7 billion over 12 years in support of the implementation of the pan-Canadian framework on clean growth and climate change. After years of inaction under the previous government, I think members would agree that this has been welcome news for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="5494401"> Pricing carbon pollution is the cornerstone of our efforts to combat climate change. We must reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and send a clear signal to entrepreneurs, industry, and investors that we are moving to a low-carbon future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494402">Carbon pricing offers many economic benefits, such as lower health care costs, less spending to fight climate change, and more innovation, including energy efficiency improvements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494403">Such improvements can be very beneficial. For example, in 2013 alone, energy efficiency savings averaged out to $869 per Canadian household.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494404">In conclusion, a clean environment and a strong economy go hand in hand. The global economy is moving toward cleaner growth. Canada cannot stand on the sidelines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494405">Our government is determined to ensure that Canadians will benefit from the opportunities created by a sustainable economy and all it offers, including a healthier environment for future generations.</ParaText>

The challenge we are having right now is that the same people who made Ontario less competitive are now in the PMO, and they are driving this carbon-tax mentality that is going to affect people in my community, not in the future, but very soon, today.</ParaText>

He thinks it is dirty. However, there are things we can do to help our manufacturers, particularly in places like Oshawa, with the auto sector, which is facing a real competitive disadvantage right now because of government policy. There are things the government can do to help. We have learned that the Americans are putting in steel tariffs. We build cars with steel. It is a certain type of steel. Unless the Liberals exempt steel coming from the States, there is going to be a 25% increase in costs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494408">I know that he knows it. Maybe we will find out today. Could the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> please let Canadians and job creators know how much this carbon tax is going to cost?

              <ParaText id="5494409">Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague opposite for his question. I enjoy working with him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494410">With regard to competitiveness and the impact a price on carbon pollution may have, I would like to remind him, even though I know he already knows, that 80% of Canadians live in a province that already has a price on carbon. Those include the most densely populated provinces, namely, Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia. Their growth is higher than average and they have maintained that growth over the past few years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494411">Pricing carbon has had no impact on competitiveness. On the contrary, we believe it encourages innovation, and that is supported by empirical evidence. Pricing carbon can have a very positive impact as businesses, industries, and consumers adapt and innovate to reduce their energy consumption and use energy more efficiently. That is not something we can ignore. We cannot only cherry-pick the facts that are most convenient. British Columbia put a price on carbon pollution several years ago and it has been experiencing strong economic growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494412">With regard to the steel and aluminum tariffs, I think that we all agree that we need to take a stand against these unacceptable and, in our opinion, illegal tariffs imposed by the American administration. Canada must stand firm in defending its interests and always be calm and reasonable in its dealings with the United States.</ParaText>

In 2017, we announced the elimination of certain tax credits for oil and gas exploration expenses. All these measures support our objective of phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies by 2025, as promised.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5494428">Mr. Speaker, it is true that climate change often impacts the most vulnerable among us. By moving away from the boutique tax credits that the Conservatives brought forth as their way of trying to help, which always focused more on the few than the many, the measures we have taken represent a different approach. We want to give more to those who need it the most, such as through the Canada child benefit that the member mentioned. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494429"> Just two days ago, when I met with the Alberta Council of Women's Shelters, I was told how big an impact this has had on the people it serves. We have stopped sending the Canada child benefit to the families of millionaires, in order to focus on those who need it the most. We know that the vast majority of those who receive the maximum amount more often than not are single mothers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494430">This has had a terrific impact, just like the investments we are making into the Canada workers benefit, which will help low-income workers. We are also moving away from the boutique tax credits and the approach the previous government took, where, inevitably, at every corner, it would focus on the wealthiest among us. We think prosperity should be inclusive, and that is the approach we have taken.</ParaText>

I can speak for my region, where Quebec City has announced a tramway project so ambitious that it will have an impact on the time it takes for people to get to work, and on the environment with respect to the number of days there is smog in Quebec City.

It is leadership that was completely lacking from the Conservative side. They were content to bury their heads in the sand. As for the Liberals, they are being completely inconsistent when it comes to fighting climate change, especially in light of their recent decisions. I will come back to that later in my speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494435">Let me begin by saying that I am disappointed that the Conservatives are so obsessed with this issue that they do not see all the other important issues that we could be discussing in the House. They are obsessed with this topic. They are fixated on a document from October 20, 2015, the day after the election of that same year. The document, to which they keep referring, is some sort of memo or email from the Department of Finance in which the figures are redacted. If the Conservatives seriously want to obtain this document then I do not understand why they have not managed to get their hands on it. That document was dated the day after the election and was highly likely prepared during the 2015 election campaign, when the Conservatives were technically still in power. The Conservatives have developed a baffling fixation with this document.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494436">I am fortunate to sit on the Standing Committee on Finance, where we heard public servants being quizzed about this. They said that the document was prepared during the campaign along with many documents put together in the event that a new government was elected. They worked on several scenarios based on the election platforms of the different parties. It seems that it was common practice in the public service, during and a little after the campaign, to start doing the groundwork for potential changes in government policies and in advance of the swearing in of the prime minister and cabinet. That is what the Conservatives continue to refer to. They are fixated on this document, which is a little surprising given that it was prepared under their watch.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494437">It is also a little surprising to see them so opposed to the polluter pays principle whereby those who pollute have to pay for the cost of that pollution to our environment and our society. In several other areas, paying for one's pollution is standard practice. Our municipal taxes, for instance, pay for our garbage to be taken to the dump. The same principle applies to recycling, because there is a cost associated with taking recyclable materials to a recycling centre. The polluter pays principle applies in most sectors. We pay for the pollution we create.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494438">Until just recently, however, this principle has never applied to greenhouse gas pollution. That is what this government is trying to do, as are the provincial governments and many governments around the world that have already taken action in that regard. It is the right thing to do. As in other areas, whoever is responsible for polluting should have to pay for the cost it imposes on our society. The Conservatives do not seem to understand, nor are they willing to try to understand, that this principle should also apply to polluting our atmosphere.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5494439">If this principle is good enough for the garbage we bury in landfills, why should it not also apply to the pollution we put in the air, which goes out into the atmosphere and surely has a significant impact? I do not think we still need to make a case for the existence of and the science behind climate change. Only a few Conservatives still deny the existence of climate change, or more specifically, the fact that human activity affects climate change. Thankfully, their numbers are dwindling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494440">During the recent campaign in Ontario, we heard Conservative candidates denying that humans had anything to do with climate change. Some of them are in complete denial. Fortunately, a few of them have seen the light with regard to the action that we must take and some others support the polluter pays principle. There are also some Conservative thinkers who have realized that this is the right thing to do. Take for example, Mr. Manning, a well-known Conservative, who has come to realize that a carbon tax is one of the most effective ways to combat climate change. I am also thinking of Canada's Ecofiscal Commission, which did a lot of work on this issue. This commission is made up of a number of thinkers from various backgrounds, including some who are a bit more fiscally conservative. They realized that a carbon tax is the best way to fight climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494441">Based on their studies, they came to the conclusion that, of all the possible tools at their disposal, pricing carbon is the most effective way of meeting our objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Conservatives alone continue to deny the facts and the studies and findings that have been confirmed by countries around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494442">It is really unfortunate that they are still in denial. Fortunately, leaders around the world have begun implementing polluter pays mechanisms and putting a price on carbon. Take for example British Columbia. It put a price on carbon over 10 years ago. Alberta did the same just recently, and so did Quebec and Ontario. They joined California in implementing a carbon exchange, even though Ontario may end up changing its system. Provinces across Canada have been showing leadership on this issue, and they have had some success.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494443">I do not necessarily want to repeat the Liberal government’s words, but we are told that 80% of Canadians are currently subject to a carbon pricing system. We see that these jurisdictions are the most economically successful. This flies in the face of the Conservatives’ message and talking points; they say that carbon pricing will spell the end of the economy, that it will catastrophically blow up the Canadian economy, and that as a result, the economy will go into a tailspin. However, Alberta has the highest economic growth, at over 4%, and has also had carbon pricing for a few years now. The economies of British Columbia, Quebec, and Ontario are also doing well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494444">It is hard to understand why the Conservatives think that there is a cause and effect and that a Canada-wide carbon price will be catastrophic, as well as lead to an economic apocalypse in Canada as soon as it is brought in. This is not supported by any facts, and these are just political talking points for the Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5494445">This brings me to the importance of the fight against climate change. I am pleased to speak to this issue and say to my constituents that it is extremely important to me. This must be our primary concern here in Ottawa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494446">In Sherbrooke, hundreds of people constantly write to me on this and other environmental topics. These are very important concerns for us. People are aware of the impact of the climate change that we are seeing across Canada and around the world. They understand that Ottawa must have leaders in the fight against climate change. I am therefore very happy to represent them and to stand up and assure them that this is also very important to me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494447">It is often said that we must protect the planet for future generations. I still count myself among them to a certain extent, although I am already 27 years old and quite a bit older than when I was first elected. When they say that climate change will affect the youngest, it is because they will have to live with its long-term impacts. I can understand that, and I am certainly worried about my own future on this planet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494448">We must do everything in our power to slow the impact of climate change, because everyone understands that the process is already under way. We are already seeing the effects, unfortunately, but we have a duty to slow down this process and minimize its impact on future generations and my generation. We want to continue to have a planet where we enjoy living. As my colleague said, we can still swim in our lakes and rivers across Canada, but I fear that this will change in the long term. When I am 80 or 90 years old, if we keep going in the direction we are heading in now, I am not even sure that I will be able to enjoy the same quality of air or water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494449">That is why I am always happy to share my thoughts on this issue and demand more action from the government. Clearly, doing nothing is not an option, but that still seems to be the Conservatives' preference. They just want to wait, hope, and pray. Some Conservatives pray many times a day, but prayers will not slow the effects of climate change. To do that, we need a real plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494450">We must also remember that the cost of inaction is much higher than the cost of action. That is another thing the Conservatives seem to be forgetting here. Yes, there is a cost to taking action, and when the government takes action, it has to get good value for money. An example of that is carbon and pollution pricing, as I was saying off the top. The cost of inaction is much higher, though. The National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy, which the Conservatives shut down in 2011, pegged the cost of inaction at $5 billion per year by 2020 and up to $43 billion per year by 2050. Those costs are much higher than the cost of carbon pricing. The Conservatives seem to have lost sight of that in this discussion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494451">At the Standing Committee on Finance, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214462" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> asked the same questions every time, just like he asks the same questions every day in question period. When people talk to him about the cost of inaction, he does not seem to get that such a things exists. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="30">(1130)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5494452">It is truly unfortunate that the Conservatives are so blinded by their ideology. They do not understand that these measures are necessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494453">I also want to talk about what various provinces have done, particularly Alberta, which is a real role model in this area. There is the principle of revenue neutrality, which is also part of this government's approach. This means no cost to Canadians. Once again, the Conservatives do not seem to understand. Every time we remind them, either in committee or here in the House, that this will be revenue neutral, they do not seem to understand that every dollar raised by carbon pricing is reinvested directly into the economy. The Conservatives cannot seem to grasp this concept.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494454">Alberta is an excellent example of revenue neutrality, and less fortunate low-income families even have a surplus at the end of the year. They receive more money than they pay for carbon pricing. These figures are obviously put forward by the Alberta government. I do not have the exact numbers in front of me today, but costs are estimated at around $400 for each low-income family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494455">Furthermore, these are the families least affected by the carbon tax because they consume the least. The tax is estimated at $400 per family, but the Government of Alberta gave out direct rebates of about $500. They came out on top at the end of the year. I used the past tense, but I should also use the present. They come out on top at the end of the year. This system is still in place in Alberta. An important part of the discussion should be that the money from the carbon tax is directly invested into the provinces or given directly to citizens through direct transfers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494456">This brings me to the Liberals' inconsistent approach to the environment, even though today we are talking about the carbon tax and we support this initiative, as we said earlier. All of the major political parties, except one, promised some kind of carbon tax in the last election. I must commend the Liberals on their initiative. However, I condemn their inconsistent approach to combatting climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494457">Everyone, including the people of Sherbrooke, saw what happened recently. We were outraged by the government's decision to invest $4.5 billion of our money in a pipeline transporting oil sands to British Columbia, in spite of obvious opposition in several regions of British Columbia, including indigenous reserves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494458">The government decided to take money from the people of Sherbrooke, who pay their taxes every year and every day. It decided to take taxpayers' money to invest in a 70-year old pipeline that leaks. Just recently that pipeline leaked 5,000 litres of oil. I want to use the very apt analogy that my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="214102" Type="2">Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie</Affiliation> used yesterday, I believe. He said it is as though the government decided in 1990 to invest in the VHS industry, which was obviously doomed to sputter, if not fail, with the arrival of new technologies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494459">In this case, the government is deciding, with a glaring lack of long-term vision, to take taxpayers' money and invest it in the energy of yesterday, specifically in a pipeline and even a pipeline expansion. The government is going to inject an additional $12 billion to $15 billion of public money into the expansion of this pipeline in order to transport even more oil.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494460">This is completely inconsistent with the current narrative of the Liberals, who signed the Paris Agreement and say they want to fight climate change. They then turn around and take our money to invest it in a pipeline, an extremely bad deal for Canadians. No private investor was prepared to invest money in this project, and the company that owned the pipeline could not find a buyer.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5494461">How can the government claim that this is good for Canadians when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was the only person willing to kick in? This project certainly conveys no vision for our country's future. I just wanted to make sure I condemned that in my speech today. We are talking about climate change and greenhouse gas reduction measures, but we have a government that is inconsistent, to say the least. It says it wants to fight climate change, but then it turns around and spends an eye-watering $4.5 billion on this pipeline. That is an astronomical sum. What could we do with $4.5 billion? The opportunities that could be created with $4.5 billion would be amazing, especially if invested in an energy transition. However, the government has chosen to spend it on a project that is utterly devoid of any vision for the future and is doomed to fail, given that no private investor was willing to risk a penny on it. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5494464">I do not know if my colleague has been to Alberta and has seen the impact that the NDP's policies have had on its economy. There are some issues with the member's argument. He supports the NDP climate change plan but a big portion of that plan was to get the social licence to build pipelines. We have not had a pipeline built despite having a punitive carbon tax on everyday Albertans. He also commented on how much he opposes the pipeline. There are some diametrical issues there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494465">Alberta has had a carbon tax for decades. It was initially put on the largest emitters. The funds from that carbon tax were not charged to regular Albertans but were charged to the largest emitters who are using those funds to invest in renewable projects like Enbridge's Blackspring wind farm. The carbon footprint of a barrel of oil is down to a third of what it was decades ago because of that carbon tax on the largest emitters. The member said that, now, with the provincial NDP government, those funds from the carbon tax are being reinvested in the economy. Actually, for the last two provincial budgets, the carbon tax was put into general revenue to try to balance the budget. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494466">The member said that the carbon tax should be reinvested in the economy or given back to Albertans, but the provincial NDP government has now said that the carbon tax is being put into general revenue to try to balance its budget.

              <ParaText id="5494467">Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his intervention and for pointing out that Alberta instituted carbon pricing long before the NDP formed government. It was actually implemented by a Conservative government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494468">I want to reiterate that I absolutely agree with the idea of revenue neutrality. This would mean that any carbon pricing revenue collected by the government would have to be fully reinvested, either by giving rebates directly to residents of the province or territory or by injecting it into the economy to make an energy transition. That is what I would hope for from any government that opts for a carbon tax. It needs to be part of a long-term strategy leading to a decision to use this revenue to make an energy transition and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, unlike what we have been seeing over the past decades. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494469">My hope is that, in the future, there will be no need for a carbon tax because we will have moved to a carbon-free economy. Obviously, that is a long-term goal, but I hope that we reinvest so much money from the carbon tax into the energy and the economy of the future, that the carbon tax will become a thing of the past and the revenue it generates will gradually fall as our economy reduces its reliance on fossil fuels as much as possible.</ParaText>

I believe it was the first government in North America that determined that it was necessary to put a price on pollution. That was a Progressive Conservative government that made that determination. There have been other Conservative leaders, such as Preston Manning and so forth, who have recognized that.</ParaText>

In Alberta, the NDP government recognized the value of the environment and the economy working together. On the one hand, we see that there is concern about emissions and a price on pollution, and on the other hand, we see the value of a pipeline. The NDP premier has said that we need to be able to move forward on both.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5494473">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague's question. Sometimes I get the impression that the Liberals do not understand that the NDP believes that the economy and the environment go hand in hand. We are saying the same thing, but the Liberals do not want to acknowledge it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494474">Just on Tuesday, we debated an opposition motion that clearly set out our vison for the economy of the future, namely, an economy that protects the environment. The two go hand in hand. We cannot have an economy that kills the environment. There would be no more economic activity if the quality of the environment deteriorated to the point where it was difficult to live on this planet. That is why I sometimes have a hard time understanding why the Liberals are accusing us of seeing only one side of the story. The environment is extremely important, but the economy of the future will enable us to protect it. My colleague was right in reminding members that Alberta is a good example of investing in the economy of the future. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494475">However, what I have a hard time understanding is how the Liberal government decided to invest in a pipeline, because that certainly has nothing to do with the economy of the future. If the Liberals want to say that the economy and the environment go hand in hand, they cannot invest in a pipeline in 2018. I do not think that is a good choice for protecting the environment and growing the economy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5494476">Mr. Speaker, the Liberals keep repeating over and over that the economy and the environment go hand in hand. Everyone in the House agrees with that and knows that. What Canadians really want to know is how the Liberals rationalize what is apparent to everyone as a clear contradiction: they cannot triple a pipeline, triple the export of raw bitumen, expand fossil fuel infrastructure, and reduce carbon emissions at the same time. The Liberals say that they can do that. It is like saying that we want to reduce gambling by building more casinos. It just does not make sense to Canadians. It does not make sense as a matter of logic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494477">If they are going to expand the pipeline and triple the export of raw bitumen and put that much more carbon in the air, they have to reduce emissions elsewhere to not only meet that but to actually go below that if we are going to reduce our carbon emissions, as we committed to in Paris under the Paris climate accord.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494478">I am wondering if my hon. colleague has ever seen any math from the Liberals that show where they intend to make other cuts in Canada's carbon emissions such that we can actually meet our commitments and do what we can to avoid that terribly serious 2°C rise in temperature, which will cause catastrophic climate change, not only in the future but now, when we are experiencing floods and forest fires all over the country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5494480">That is actually a significant gap in the Liberal strategy. The government signed the Paris Accord, but to date it has said nothing about how it will reach its targets, not to mention that it decided to triple the production or export capacity of a pipeline. I would like to see the numbers to show otherwise, but the government never proved that it took into account the increase in greenhouse gas emissions and that it would offset this increase with reductions in other sectors it had presumably targeted. Unfortunately, there is no transparency on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494481">The government is moving forward blindly, making piecemeal decisions willy-nilly, and it does not seem to have a comprehensive strategy.

              <ParaText id="5494487">I would like to bring forward one example. That example is something that is obviously important to me in my riding of Foothills, and that is the impact of the carbon tax on agriculture. The <Affiliation DbId="214302" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture</Affiliation>, a couple of weeks ago, in our agriculture and agri-food committee, as well as in the Senate, claimed that Canadian farmers are very supportive of the Liberal's carbon tax. I have not spoken to one single farmer who has phoned me or sent me an email who supports the Liberal carbon tax. In fact, it is quite the opposite. They are extremely concerned about the impact the Liberal carbon tax will have on their farms. It is a farm-killing carbon tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494488">I would like to quote a couple of prominent people from the industry. The chair of the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association said, “I'm not sure who has been briefing [the agriculture minister], but he is dead wrong if he thinks that most farmers support the carbon tax”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494489">The president of the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association said, “Farmers don't agree on everything, but if there's one issue they stand together on, it's in opposition to a carbon tax.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494490">It appears that the <Affiliation DbId="214302" Type="4">agriculture minister</Affiliation> is misrepresenting the view of Canadian farmers when it comes to the carbon tax. All we are asking the minister is how much the carbon tax is going to be impacting our Canadian farmers, yet the Liberals will not do that. They will not come clean with those numbers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494491">Farmers, ranchers, and ag processors are dependent on any constant they can have in their industry. Unlike any other sector, our farmers and ranchers face so many unknowns, whether commodity prices, weather, or trade agreements, and the Liberals are adding yet another piece of uncertainty to their livelihoods. The carbon tax is just another attack on rural Canadians, specifically on agriculture. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494492">Let us take a look at some of the things our farmers and ranchers have had to face over the last couple of years with the Liberal government. There is front-of-pack labelling. This is going to be devastating to Canadian agriculture, and the government has absolutely refused to listen to our stakeholders. In fact, it has gone out of its way to ensure that they are not included in the debate on front-of-pack labelling. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494493">The same can be said of Canada's food guide. The government is once again pushing ideological ideas, telling Canadians, according to another Liberal values test, what is healthy and what they should be eating. They are telling them to stay away from meat protein and dairy products, because those things are unhealthy. There is no common sense to that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494494">That is just the beginning. There is the bungling of trade agreements. We are losing a lot of our pulse export opportunities in India, one of our major trading partners. It is a $4-billion industry that is now in jeopardy because the Liberals have bungled our relationship with India. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494495">Now we see that NAFTA is at a critical stage. We have finally seen the TPP tabled today, but will we ratify it so that we are one of the first six countries to take advantage of those new market opportunities? We have also heard that for our producers, their entrepreneurial spirit is being crushed by no longer being eligible for the small business tax deduction. All these things are making it more and more difficult for our agriculture sector and our farmers and ranchers to be successful, to reach those new markets, and to stay in business. It seems to be on every tool they have to be successful and wake up in the morning and go to work. It takes away their feeling that they are worthwhile and that what they are doing is appreciated by Canadians. That is why they are finding this to be most frustrating.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5494496">The Conservative are trying to fight for the taxpayer. We want to know what the implication of this will be for our constituents. At the agriculture and agri-food committee, we asked several times for a study on the carbon tax and the impact it would have on agriculture. Every time we asked, we were blocked by the Liberal members. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494497">Farmers have earned the right to know how a Liberal policy will impact their everyday lives. It will impact their livelihood. Is this something they want to pass on to their sons, daughters, nieces, and nephews? Many of our farmers have been on the land for generations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494498">The other thing the Liberal carbon tax does not take into consideration is the environmental stewardship and the work our farmers have been doing for years to try to protect the land, aquifers, and waterways, which are so important to them. They use zero tillage, new methods and innovation to be on the land much less than they were, and are growing higher yields on less land. They have been doing all these things on their own, without having a carbon tax imposed on them. These things should be taken into consideration, but they are not. In fact, it has gone the other way. The government is going to impose yet another obstacle for our agriculture industry to be successful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494499">Earlier this morning my colleague talked about taxation without representation. This is yet another example of the Liberals moving ahead with an ideological policy but not having the confidence to take those decisions to Canadians. They do not have the confidence to open it up and put it on the table. The Liberals campaigned in 2015 about being open and transparent and doing things differently. They have had opportunities to come clean on the cost of this. We know from the Parliamentary Budget Officer and the Department of Finance that the carbon tax will be more detrimental to rural Canadians, and even more detrimental to western farmers as opposed to eastern Canadian farmers. We know those numbers. Therefore, why will the Liberals not come clean and just say what it will cost and the impact it will have on the agricultural sector?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494500">The Liberals keep talking about the importance of agriculture to our economy. They have set this goal of reaching $75 billion in exports by 2025. It is great to have those aspirational goals, but if, at the same time, they are cutting the legs out from under the agricultural sector, taking away every tool farmers have to try and reach that goal, then they are being disingenuous to our Canadian farmers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494501">Previously, I talked about taxation without representation. However, another tax that will have a profound impact on our farmers is the escalator tax. The Liberals have put forward an unprecedented escalator tax that will increase the cost of beer, wine, and spirits every year, and it will not have to go through the scrutiny of Parliament. Canadians will not have a voice or an opportunity to speak their minds on a tax increase that will come forward every year. That will impact our agriculture sector. We have barley and rye growers, and producers out there, certainly in the wine industry, who are very excited about the new opportunities with craft distilling and craft beer. They will pay the escalator tax over and over again, and now also for a carbon tax. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494502">I do not think we are asking the Liberal government anything unwarranted. We asking it to be open, transparent, and honest with Canadians. What is the carbon tax going to cost our Canadian farmers and ranchers? They are up every day, putting in their blood, sweat, and tears to ensure we have the best quality food on our table and doing everything they can to feed the world. However, for every opportunity they have had, the Liberals have made it more and more difficult. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494503">I will conclude with a question for the Liberal government. What is its farm-killing carbon tax going to cost Canadian farm families?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5494510"> Once again the Liberals are very good at making a mess of policy, but then just throwing it to the provinces to make the decisions for them. The member says that 80% of Canadians already live in a jurisdiction with a carbon tax. That will be very different, very soon, with the change in government in Ontario. It will not be 80% anymore. A year from now, when the NDP is out of Alberta, it will not even be close to 80%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494511">We are seeing a trend. Canadians have started to understand the implication of what a carbon tax is. It is just a tax grab by Liberal and NDP governments that does absolutely nothing to address greenhouse gas emissions or climate change, or any of these things.

              <ParaText id="5494517">Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Earlier today the draft appropriation bill was circulated. I want to draw the House's attention to schedule 1, vote 40 for the Treasury Board Secretariat. The language used for vote 40 differs substantially from the language used in the estimates document. The estimates describe vote 40 as follows:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494518"> “Budget implementation $7,040,392,000”</ParaText>

                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494520"> This is the language deemed to have been adopted and reported to the House by the government operations and estimates committee. The schedule description in the draft supply bill would confer different authority on the government, none of it approved or deemed to have been approved by the House. In short, the government is seeking new authority for unknown, unspecified spending of public monies without telling Parliament. It is creating what is commonly known as a slush fund by seeking to make expenditures based on the budget document rather than the estimates document, which carries the constitutionally significant recommendation of the Governor General.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494521">I refer the Speaker to sections 53 and 54 of the Constitution Act, 1867, Standing Orders 79 and 80, chapter 18 of the third edition of <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, and Sessional Paper No. 8520-421-181, which was transmitted to the House on April 16 in the form of a message from Her Excellency the Governor General, signed by her own hand. These are the main estimates.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494522">Let me draw everyone's attention to page 883 of <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, which states, “Concurrence in the estimates or in interim supply is an order of the House to bring in an appropriation bill or bills giving effect to the spending authority (amounts and destinations) that the House has approved.” I emphasize, “that the House has approved”. It continues, “Supply bills must be based on the estimates or interim supply as concurred in by the House.” Again I emphasize, “as concurred in by the House”. The same language appears in the first and second editions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494523">Table A2.11 originated in the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>'s budget. It is not contained in the estimates, is not part of the recommendations of the Governor General, has not been considered or concurred in by any committee, has not been concurred in by the House. Nor has any committee reported to the House to advocate that it be included in the supply bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494524"> It is not open to the government to create, delete, or alter the authority and purposes of the appropriation bill by inventing new language in this schedule, which alters the decisions of the House as expressed when it has concurred in the estimates contained in Sessional Paper No. 8520-421-181. The government is not entitled to rewrite the estimates in ways that amend the decisions of the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494525">Let me conclude with a word of caution to the House, particularly in light of the present-day political conditions in the Senate.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5494537">A carbon tax in Saskatchewan will not happen. It is Saskatchewan's jurisdiction to put on a tax. A member across the aisle just asked a question to the member for <Affiliation DbId="214552" Type="2">Foothills</Affiliation> about seeking the advice of the provincial governments for their analysis on the carbon tax, because he has admitted it was their domain. He is right. It is Saskatchewan's domain as to whether or not it decides to put on a carbon tax, and it knows that would be a bad decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494538"> That does not mean that Saskatchewan is not being responsible about the environment. It presented a plan to the federal government that would allow them to meet all their environmental requirements, emissions requirements, and be progressive without a carbon tax. One would think the <Affiliation DbId="214310" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> would say that is great, that she is excited for Saskatchewan, and proud of it. However, what did she do? In the last budget she put $104 million in the budget for carbon costs. Wait a minute. This is supposed to be revenue neutral. Where is the $104 million coming from? There goes revenue neutral. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494539">That just shows the reality of what the government is doing with the carbon tax. It is a way for it to tax people. It is a way for it to pick winners and losers in the economy as it sees fit. It is a way for the government to put its fingers where they do not belong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494540">In Saskatchewan we have been concerned about the environment for years, long before “environmental protection” and “environmental assessment” or “taking care of the environment” were the cool words being expressed by the <Affiliation DbId="214310" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> here today, this week, or the last couple of years. I can think back to “no till”. Saskatchewan embraced no till. It is actually good for the soil, good for the water, and good for the environment. Farmers grabbed that technology and said, yes, this makes sense. The other thing that happened with no till was that it was economical. It made sense economically for them to do that. That is why it was embraced. This is a classic example of the economy and the environment going hand in hand. If we look at things in the economy that actually improve the environment, no till is a classic example. Direct seed is another classic example. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494541">We should not kid ourselves. There were lots of challenges starting down that path, and lots of issues with weed management, crop rotations, and soil degradation. All of those things have to be figured out and managed, but the will and the spirit of the farmers of Canada, and in western Canada, can overcome that. Now if we look at the Prairies, and they end up with a summer with four or five inches of rain, they would still get a crop. However, back in the 1970s if they ended up with just four inches of rain, it would be a dust bowl. That is the advantage that Saskatchewan and the farmers in western Canada and Ontario have by taking care of the environment, and also by having a good economic future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494542">When we look at the carbon tax, it does not do that. If a farmer in western Canada has a carbon tax, he or she is less competitive than all other farmers in the world. We take the world price. The price for wheat is set in Minneapolis or Chicago, as are the prices for soybeans and canola. Everything is interrelated. When I have a carbon tax I cannot pass that cost on. I am not a manufacturer. I am a farmer. I take the market price based on the global supply and demand, so when I have to pay that cost it comes off my bottom line.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5494543">What does that mean to me and my operation? That means profits come out of my operation that normally would have gone to reinvesting in my farm to make it even more environmentally friendly and more economical, investing in new technologies and new machinery that would actually reduce my greenhouse gases even more. However, because I am sending it to Ottawa I cannot do that. Does that make sense?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494544">There are so many things about the carbon tax that Canadians have to get their heads around, which the Liberals have not gotten their heads around. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494545">We have manufacturing facilities and we have steel plants that are the most green and efficient in the world, yet because of the carbon tax they are shutting down. What will be replacing them? Those products still are required by Canadians and people around the world. The products that will be replacing them are from plants in other jurisdictions that do not have the same environmental regulations, that do not have the same requirements to labour codes and safety. The products are coming from India and China and places like that, which our Canadian companies cannot compete with because they have a carbon tax. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494546">Have Liberals helped the environment when they shut down Canadian companies so that companies in China can just build more product as they see fit without any concern for the environment? No, they have done the opposite. They have not only put Canadians out of work; they have actually done more harm to the environment. There must be a better scheme to hit the emissions targets than a carbon tax, and that message has been repeated over and over again to that deaf group on the opposite side.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494547">We have to step back and ask what they are doing this for. Why is this moving forward? Why would they want this? They have all this evidence to show them that the carbon tax does not work. Australia tried it and backed away from it and ended it. France was going to do it, but the French did their analysis and then said they were not going to do it. That is why we are asking the government to do its analysis and make it public because it might look at it and say this is stupid and we had better not do it. I think the reality is that they have looked at the numbers and said this is stupid but we are still going to do it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494548">What do we do? How do we help them? There are so many examples in the current government where the Liberals have done things where we tried to help them, but they put on their blinders and were going to do it their way. In the meantime, who pays? Canadians and Canadian jobs pay. At the end of the day, what does this country look like?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494549"> The Liberals inherited a balanced budget. They inherited a strong economy. They inherited a low unemployment rate. They have spent billions and billions of dollars, on what? What has it gone to? Has it gone to more government bureaucracy? I do not see any new bridges. I do not see any new roads. I do not see any new sewers or septic. I hear of a lot more bureaucrats being hired. I hear a lot of giggles and laughter over there. They can spend money like drunken sailors and they do not seem to care. I care, because my kids are going to pay for it. The graduation classes of 2018 are going to have to pay for the mistakes of the current government, and the Liberals do not care because they do not have to pay. It is not their money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494550">In closing, I look at this and I am amazed at how many times the government has refused to look at science, has refused to look at the evidence, and has decided to put things in place that go against science. The classic example is the number of bills they have put through this House of Commons where the minister gets the final say, not science and not industry. Decisions should be based on good science, whether it is a pipeline or a new food product. New food products should be based on science and whether they are safe to eat. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494551">What do they put in? They put that the minister will decide, and by the way, the minister will decide without any consequences or any responsibility to inform how he or she came to that decision. They wonder why people do not want to invest in Canada. It is because it has become such an unpredictable environment to invest in. Why would they?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494552">When we talk about a carbon tax cover-up, that is exactly what it is because I think they know the numbers and they do not want to tell us. The reason they do not want to tell us is that the numbers are bad and they are trying to look for another reason to hide this carbon tax. The latest spin is that it is the provinces' jurisdiction. Okay, if it is the provinces' jurisdiction, then they should butt out of Saskatchewan's business and mind their own. </ParaText>

However, it is incontrovertible that the best evidence from around the world, from established agencies like the International Monetary Fund, the International Energy Agency, and the World Bank, is that all economies need to stop subsidizing fossil fuels, as Stephen Harper promised to do in 2009, and all economies need to put a price on carbon. In this country and this generation, I absolutely understand why the Liberals have structured it so that any province can design its own plan and the money will be returned to that province. Therefore, it is revenue neutral to the federal government. However, it is not clear whether it is going to be revenue neutral in the hands of that province, but that is up to the individual province.</ParaText>

When we have a province like Saskatchewan that has a plan that is going to reduce emissions, will be good for the environment, and will meet all the targets that have been laid in front of us, why would the government not accept it? If that plan does not include a carbon tax, why is that a problem?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494562"> It should not be a problem if we have met all of our requirements and obligations but have done it in a different way. Why should the government be upset if it is done in a different way? It comes back to what the end game is for this carbon tax. The word is “taxation”. That is the end game for the current government. Whether it is directly or indirectly, it will have more revenues from a carbon tax. It is going to take money out of the pockets of people and will not change the activities of the people on the ground. Rural farmers have to drive to town. They have to burn petrol. There is no way around it at this point in time, and there is no way around it in the near future. Why punish those rural farmers by taxing them? That is what Saskatchewan did. It found a better way to do it without punishing those rural farmers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5494566">The impacts of climate change, such as coastal erosion, thawing permafrost, and increases in heat waves, droughts, and flooding are already being felt throughout Canada. In response to the critical need to take urgent national action on this global issue, Canada's first ministers adopted the pan-Canadian framework on clean growth and climate change on December 9, 2016. One of the core elements of the framework is to put a price on carbon pollution throughout Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494567">Pricing carbon is widely recognized as an efficient way to reduce emissions at the lowest cost to business and consumers, and to support innovation and clean growth. The aim of putting a price on carbon pollution is to reduce emissions by sending a price signal to the economy as a whole. Businesses, investors, and consumers change their behaviour when they take carbon pricing into account in their daily decision-making.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494568">Carbon pricing has worked all over the world, from British Columbia to California to the United Kingdom. In all of those places, emissions have dropped and the economy has continued to grow. Just recently, Environment and Climate Change Canada released a new analysis confirming that carbon pricing will do the same across Canada, significantly reducing emissions while maintaining strong economic growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494569">The new study found that carbon pricing could reduce carbon pollution by up to 90 million tonnes across Canada in 2022, as much as taking 26 million cars off the road for a year or shutting down more than 20 coal plants. The study also found that GDP growth would remain strong with a nationwide price on carbon pollution. Canada's GDP is expected to grow by approximately 2% a year between now and 2022, with or without carbon pricing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5494570">Almost 85% of Canadians already live in a province or territory that puts a price on carbon pollution, and all governments have committed to some form of carbon pricing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494571">To extend carbon pricing across Canada, in October 2016, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> released the federal carbon pricing standard, a benchmark, that gives provinces and territories the flexibility to implement the type of system that is best for them, while setting certain basic criteria that all systems must meet to ensure that they are fair and effective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494572">The Government of Canada is also committed to developing and implementing a federal carbon pricing system as a backstop. This backstop will therefore apply to any province or territory that does not have a carbon pricing system that meets the federal standard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494573">The greenhouse gas pricing act establishes the legal framework for the federal carbon pricing system, which serves as a backstop. The primary objective of the act is to help reduce Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions by ensuring that a price is set on carbon across Canada and that it increases over time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494574">As part of its commitment to the Canada-wide approach to carbon pricing, the government will apply the federal pricing system only to the provinces and territories that it lists in schedule 1 of the act because they do not have a system that meets the benchmark. It also states that it will assess the provincial and territorial systems annually to ensure that they continue to meet this benchmark.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494575">The federal carbon pricing system introduced by the act has two components: a levy on fossil fuels that is generally payable by fuel producers or distributors, also known as “fuel costs”; and a performance-based system for industrial facilities, also known as “production-based pricing”. These components are intended to complement each other and to ensure that there is no double pricing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494576">In December, the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="214310" Type="4">Minister of the Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation> wrote to the provincial and territorial governments to provide them with the carbon pricing timelines. Provinces and territories wishing to establish or maintain their own systems must confirm their intentions by September 1, 2018. The Government of Canada will then determine whether the provincial and territorial systems will meet the federal carbon pricing standard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494577">In provinces and territories that do not meet the federal standard, the federal carbon pricing system will apply as of January 1, 2019, at an initial price of $20 per tonne of emissions. Provincial and territorial systems will be assessed annually. This timeline provides clarity to everyone involved and will enable consumers, businesses, and investors to make informed decisions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5494578">Businesses already know carbon pricing makes good sense. According to a report from the Carbon Disclosure Project, the number of companies with plans to internally price their own carbon pollution increased between 2014 and 2017, from 150 to almost 1,400. The list includes more than 100 of the world's largest companies, with total annual revenues of $7 trillion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494579">In Canada, many energy companies, our top five banks, and major consumer goods companies support a price on pollution. They are all part of the Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition. They know carbon pricing can make Canadian businesses more innovative and competitive, and that it provides certainty to investors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494580">A recent study ranked Canada fourth in the world as a clean technology innovator, up from seventh place in 2014. Last year, 11 of Canada's clean-tech companies ranked in the top 100 worldwide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494581">Companies such as Winnipeg's Farmers Edge are developing cutting-edge technologies that help farmers waste less energy and increase their profits. Ecobee in Toronto makes smart thermostats that link up with smart phones to help Canadians save money and make their homes more comfortable. Dartmouth's CarbonCure has developed a technology to capture carbon pollution from industry and use it to make stronger concrete.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494582">This is the kind of innovation and entrepreneurship carbon pricing is designed to support. These kinds of technologies help protect our environment, create new opportunities and middle-class jobs, and help our industries to compete.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494583">According to the World Bank, jurisdictions representing about half the global economy are putting a price on carbon, and that does not include China's national system announced late last year. As of 2018, 70 jurisdictions around the world at the national and subnational levels are putting a price on carbon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494584">The approach to carbon pricing is going to ensure that Canadians are well placed to benefit from the opportunities created by the global transition that is now under way. Carbon pricing is the most effective way to reduce emissions. It creates incentives for businesses and households to innovate and pollute less. Innovation is key to keeping Canada's economy competitive. Carbon pricing brings down emissions while driving investment in energy efficiency and in cleaner, less polluting energy sources.</ParaText>

How they choose to use the revenues generated from carbon pricing also has a big impact. Revenue can be used for rebates, tax cuts, incentives for energy efficiency or investments in clean infrastructure and innovation.

              <ParaText id="5494596">Madam Speaker, the Conservative government did not perform on this issue. I could not agree more with the member. The reason was that even though it talked about targets and put targets in the window, it never took the actions necessary to achieve those targets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494597">Our government is taking probably the single biggest measure possible to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies. The biggest fossil fuel subsidy that exists is the fact that the cost of pollution is not internalized in businesses and organizations that pollute. A price on carbon is meant to take account of that externality, which is the cost of pollution to our environment and to our society. The biggest subsidy of all is the fact that it does not cost to pollute, to produce greenhouse gas emissions and put them into the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494598">The government is taking the strongest step possible in this regard. As the member knows, there is really no agreed-upon definition of what constitutes a fossil fuel subsidy, other than the fact that when there is not a price on carbon and when polluting is free, that is the biggest subsidy of all.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="229522" Type="18">Mr. Jean-Claude Poissant (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5494599"> Madam Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to further address the member’s question on a carbon price in agriculture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494600">In fact, in many ways agriculture is leading the way in our transition to a low-carbon economy. Feeding a growing world population with sustainable agriculture is one of the defining challenges of our time. How do we achieve this goal? One word: innovation. Sustainability and innovation go hand in hand. The agriculture sector already has a solid track record of innovating and adopting new technologies to improve environmental performance and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494601">In fact, for more than a decade, greenhouse gases from agriculture have remained stable despite growth in production. A century ago, the average farmer produced enough food for about ten people. Today, that farmer can feed well over a hundred.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494602">There is no doubt that science is our most powerful tool when it comes to environment and climate change issues. Thanks to science, Canadian farmers are producing more food with less land and less water. We can indeed have sustainable agriculture for generations to come, but we need to be willing to invest. The government places a high priority on helping farmers adjust to the effects of climate change. Climate change and environment are at the heart of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada's new Canadian agricultural partnership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494603">Through this partnership, over the next five years, the federal, provincial, and territorial governments will invest $3 billion in key priorities of the agriculture sector—including the environment. Programs will help farmers capitalize on opportunities for sustainable growth while adapting to climate change. They will help farmers adopt agriculture technologies and tools to reduce GHG emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494604">Another tremendous success story is the environmental farm plans. The program helps farmers sit down and make an environmental plan for their farm, targeting practical solutions that they can use to help the environment, while boosting their bottom line.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494605"> Supported by federal-provincial-territorial funding, over the past quarter century, more than 70,000 Canadian farmers have developed environmental farm plans. Our scientists, working with universities and industry, are also fully engaged in the fight against climate change. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494606">Under budget 2017, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada is investing $70 million in agricultural science to address emerging priorities, such as climate change and soil and water conservation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494607">We are proud to be a government that recognizes science and research as important drivers of clean growth in the agricultural sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494608"> We will continue to support science and research, including on innovative ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This includes our investment of $25 million to support the adoption of clean technology by Canadian agricultural producers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494609">The $2-billion low-carbon economy fund helps provinces and territories to reduce GHG emissions, for example through carbon storage in agricultural soils. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494610">Furthermore, the government is investing $27 million in the agricultural greenhouse gases program to help farmers reduce their carbon footprint. This program is helping farmers reduce greenhouse gases and adjust to climate change in four key areas: management and feeding strategies, capturing carbon through land and tillage practices, agroforestry, and irrigation and drainage for crop production. There are 20 projects at leading universities across Canada, all focused on helping farmers make their farms even greener than they are today. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5494611"> Recent projects include measuring the environmental footprint of blueberry, potato, and forage cropping systems; environmentally-friendly grazing systems for cattle; and new cereal crops that do not have to be planted every year, saving fertilizer and water. There is also the $5.2-million agricultural youth green jobs initiative, which helps place young Canadians in green jobs within the agriculture sector. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494612">My message today is that Canadian farmers are, and will continue to be, part of the climate change solution. That is why our carbon pricing policy reflects the realities of Canada’s agricultural industry. Our government recognizes that Canadian farmers and farm families are important drivers of the Canadian economy. We understand that Canadian farmers are making important contributions in the fight against climate change, for example by adopting sustainable technologies and practices like precision agriculture or conservation tillage. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494613">We know that farmers are price takers and cannot easily pass cost increases on to consumers. That is why gasoline and diesel fuel for on-farm use is exempt from carbon pricing under the federal backstop. Alberta and British Columbia have already exempted these fuels from their carbon pricing policies. Furthermore, emissions from crop and livestock production will not be subject to carbon pricing under the federal backstop.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494614">Over 70% of Canadian farms are located in provinces that already have a carbon pricing system in place. British Columbia, Quebec, Alberta, and Ontario, which account for 80% of Canada's GHG emissions, have already implemented carbon pricing mechanisms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494615">The pan-Canadian framework on clean growth and climate change was negotiated with the provinces and territories. This historic national framework recognizes that climate action may differ from one region to the next across the country. That is why the framework gives jurisdictions the flexibility to design approaches to pricing pollution that best suit their conditions and priorities, provided they meet the federal benchmark. The provinces and territories are invited to develop their own pricing schemes. They can therefore keep the direct revenues they raise from carbon pricing to use as they see fit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494616"> Ontario and Quebec have cap and trade systems in place. Alberta has a hybrid pricing system. In all three provinces, these systems include opportunities for producers to sell their emission reductions for cash payment. Many producers in Alberta were paid because they used no-till farming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494617"> Stakeholders have asked to be consulted and we are listening. The government will continue to engage industries, provincial and territorial governments, indigenous peoples, environmental groups, and stakeholders on the design of the federal carbon pricing system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494618">Canada has the opportunity to be a global leader when it comes to feeding a growing world population sustainably. The government will provide the investments needed to maximize and accelerate the efforts of our farmers, our scientists, and industry. The government is committed to supporting farmers as they continue to be responsible stewards of our land, and will continue to work with farmers to help them capture sustainable growth while adapting to climate change.</ParaText>

In fact, many are being proactive by planting cover crops to sequester carbon and by reducing tillage and fuel use. They are already doing many of these activities. However, added to that we have this punishing carbon tax, which, in my riding, is going to add up to $6,000 for an average farmer just for fuel. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494621">My colleague says that two provinces have exempted fuel for farms, but Ontario is not one of them. Therefore, in my riding, a farmer will pay an extra $6,000 just because of this carbon tax, and that does not count the cost of getting his produce to market, whether that is grain or livestock, or getting fuel or fertilizer to his farm.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494622"> This is punishing our farmers, and worse than that, this cost will be added and passed on to middle-class Canadians. Why is the government punishing them in that way?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5494626">When sea ice melts, it does not affect the sea level. It can affect currents, such as the Gulf Stream, but because it is ice floating on water, it does not cause sea level rise. However, ice sheets, such as the Greenland ice sheet and the west Antarctic ice sheet, sit on land. This is global research in which the University of Toronto collaborated, and it states that if we lose either one of those, it would contribute eight metres to sea level rise. That is eight metres of sea level rise from a single event, if we lose the west Antarctic ice sheet or the Greenland ice sheet.</ParaText>

Likewise, we know the carbon tax will decrease our GDP significantly. </ParaText>

The Liberals admit that gasoline prices will go up by at least 11¢ a litre and that the cost of heating one's home will increase by over $200. The members of the Liberal Party may not think that is a lot of money, but for middle-class Canadians in my riding every penny counts. The Liberals forget that the decisions to commute to work, drive their kids to soccer or hockey practice, heat their homes, or travel to see loved ones are real choices to be made and that there are real costs involved. My constituents in Kitchener—Conestoga often have to commute into Toronto and other parts of Ontario for work, to visit family, or to watch a Blue Jays game.

Perhaps members of the Liberal Party prefer to spend winters in Florida, or somewhere warm, but I can assure them, southwestern Ontario is known to dip well below freezing in the winter months, and that is what makes this carbon tax even more outrageous.

One only has to look at Alberta and British Columbia with two NDP governments warring with one another, introducing tariffs, and taking each other to court, all as a result of the government's failed leadership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494646">Under our Conservative government we saw an overall reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and we did not raise taxes to do it. We focused on target regulations, incremental changes, and encouraging provinces to create their own individual plans. Members opposite would claim that we did not do anything for the environment, but that is simply not the case. As former chair of the environment committee, I know that our government was committed to cleaning up the environment, investing in wetlands, investing in conservation, and encouraging sustainable energy. That is how we see real change. In fact, during our government's mandate, greenhouse gas emissions reduced while the economy grew.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494647">Canadians and Conservatives understand that we cannot tax our way to a cleaner environment. Take British Columbia as an example. Despite having the highest carbon tax in Canada, emissions have continued to rise in British Columbia. As a result, British Columbians now pay more for gas than anyone else in North America. British Columbia's carbon tax is not helping the environment, it is just costing people more to get to work and to take their kids to hockey or soccer practice.</ParaText>

They suspect that urban dwellers will benefit from increased economic activity and jobs while farmers will be forced to foot the bill. Many farmers are also skeptical about the doom and gloom scenarios so common today. At the same time, because farmland sequesters huge amounts of carbon, farmers want to be considered part of the solution rather than part of the problem. Most do not want a cheque for what they do but would like to be left alone to farm in a sustainable manner, and not be harassed by yet another costly program based on incomplete science. They worry that expensive, ineffective onerous policies will be put in place, not because they are scientifically proven, but because they are popular.

All we are asking for is exactly what he is referring to. We want to know what the developmental costs will be. What is the cost of this carbon tax to the average Canadian family, but, more importantly, will there actually be an effect? Will it actually help to do what Liberals say it is going to do?</ParaText>

We know that, per person, carbon emissions went down by 16% in British Columbia in the first six years, while it went up in the rest of Canada by 3% over the same time period. Also during that exact time period, British Columbia had one of the fastest growing economies in the entire country.</ParaText>

Before I start, I would like to comment on the direct words related to the opposition day motion. This is not the first time that members of the opposition have been asking for information related to the proposed carbon tax and the effect it would have on the economy. In fact, in the industry committee, on October 23, 2016, a year and a half ago, I moved a motion that said:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5494726">Madam Speaker, in my riding, Vancouver Kingsway, there is a strong consensus. It is not unanimous, but a clear majority of people are very concerned about the impacts of climate change. Last summer, terrible forest fires, some of the worst since the 1950s, burned so much in British Columbia that there was actually a haze in Vancouver for many days in the summer. We are seeing an early spring runoff now, and there is flooding that is approaching the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, which is a rare event.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494727"> The truth is that if we take climate change seriously, we have to take extraordinary steps now in order to avoid a rise in temperature of 2° centigrade by 2050, and by all accounts we are not on target for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494728">The Liberals talk a good game. However, they signed Kyoto in 1997. That is 20 years ago. Eddie Goldenberg, who was Prime Minister Chrétien's assistant, publicly stated afterwards that they had no intention of ever meeting those targets. Therefore, Canadians can be rightfully suspicious of their claims now, particularly when we hear a lot of talk but the emissions are not going down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494729">What does my hon. colleague think it tells Canadians when the Liberals continue to tell them that they want to deal with climate change but there are never any reductions in GHG emissions or carbon emissions when they are in government?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5494733">Around the world, the effects of climate change are becoming increasingly evident. Sea levels are rising, threatening coastal regions with increased erosion. Extreme events, like floods and wild fires, are becoming more and more common and severe, and in the north, where temperatures are rising at three times the global average, the permafrost is thawing and sea ice is melting. As the climate continues to change, these effects will only become more frequent and more severe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494734"> The government is taking the challenge of climate change very seriously. We have a comprehensive clean growth and climate plan that includes historic investments in public transit, green infrastructure, and clean innovation. It includes phasing out coal, improving energy efficiency, and cutting methane emissions from the oil and gas sector, and it includes a national price on carbon pollution. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494735">I am quite proud to say that our plan now also includes putting a climate lens on infrastructure funded by the federal government. I would like to pause on that new green filter for just a moment, because it is a recent development and one that I have been working towards since my first days as a member of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494736">In 2016, I introduced private member's Motion No. 45 to this House, calling on the government to take into account the impact infrastructure has on Canada's greenhouse gas emissions. As the MP for Halifax, I represent one of Canada's primary coastal cities, and it is no exaggeration to say that Halifax is on the front lines of climate change when it comes to threats like worsening storms and sea level rise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494737">At the same time, our government is making an historic investment in infrastructure, $180 billion over 12 years. That is an investment that is going to transform our communities for the better. We also know, at the same time, that infrastructure has the potential to lock in greenhouse gas emissions for years to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494738">We find ourselves at a pivotal moment in our history. It is a moment that comes with a remarkable opportunity and a responsibility to get it right. That is why, in 2016, I put forward Motion No. 45, requesting that the government put a climate lens on infrastructure that it chooses to fund. It passed, and I am so glad that this climate lens has now been worked into federal policy as a required part of the bilateral funding agreements being signed between the Government of Canada and all provinces and territories. That means that as part of our infrastructure plan, applicants seeking federal funding for new major public infrastructure projects will now have to undertake an assessment of how their projects will impact greenhouse gas emissions and consider the climate change risks in the location, design, operation, and maintenance of those projects. As a city planner and as the MP for Halifax, I view that as a significant win for our city and for the sustainability and resiliency of communities all across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494739">I have just outlined some of the measures our government has put in place to protect our environment, but of course, we are here today to talk about putting a price on carbon pollution. Why? We are doing it because pricing carbon pollution works. It is the most effective, least expensive way to achieve our climate goals. It encourages innovation and keeps our economy strong. The simple fact is that without carbon pricing, cutting pollution would be much more expensive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494740">Canadians know that pollution is not free. Climate pollution leads to droughts and floods and wild fires and extreme weather, and all of these have major costs. Insurance claims from severe weather in Canada have been going up. They are more than three times higher today than they were in the 1980s and 1990s, a trend that is expected to continue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494741">Pollution also harms people's health, which has personal physiological costs and monetary costs for our health care system. Right now, it is the people most affected by these impacts who are paying the price: northerners; coastal communities; the people whose homes are flooded, as we saw in New Brunswick this spring; or those with asthma or other health conditions worsened by pollution. That is not right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494742">Carbon pricing, on the other hand, is based on the idea that the polluter should pay. Experts around the world agree. Carbon pricing is one of the most cost-effective ways to reduce emissions. That is because it is not prescriptive. It allows companies and individuals to make their own decisions on how best to cut their emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494743">In Canada, more than 80% of us already live in jurisdictions with carbon pricing in place. Recognizing that each province and territory has unique circumstances, the pan-Canadian approach would allow provinces and territories the flexibility to choose a system that makes the most sense for them: an explicit price-based system, like in B.C. or Alberta; or a cap and trade system, like in Ontario and Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494744">To ensure that a price on carbon pollution is in place across Canada, the Government of Canada has also committed to developing and implementing a federal carbon-pricing system as a backstop. This system would apply in any province or territory that requested it or that did not have a carbon pricing system in place by 2018 that met the federal standard.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5494745">We have seen how carbon pricing has worked in British Columbia. Over the past decade, B.C.'s carbon price has reduced emissions by between 5% and 15%. Meanwhile, provincial real GDP grew by more than 17% from 2007 to 2015, and per capita gasoline demand dropped 15% over that period. B.C.'s growing clean technology sector now brings in an estimated $1.7 billion in annual revenue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494746">In 2017, B.C., Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec, the four provinces with carbon pricing systems in place, were also the top four performers in GDP growth across Canada. Anyone who says that carbon pricing hurts economies is not basing their arguments on science or the evidence but rather on ignorance and fear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494747">Consider this. People may have seen recently that the Government of Canada released a report showing that carbon pricing could reduce carbon pollution by up to 90 million tonnes across Canada by 2022. That is like taking 26 million cars off the road for a year or shutting down more than 20 coal plants. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494748">At the same time, the report also found that GDP growth would remain strong with a nationwide price on carbon pollution. Canada's GDP is expected to grow by approximately two per cent per year between now and 2022, with or without carbon pricing. Regular changes in energy prices have a much bigger impact on the GDP than our carbon pricing plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494749">We do know that carbon pricing will affect the price of fuel and other goods and services. Today the opposition is asking what it will cost families. Here is an example. The Government of Alberta has calculated the cost of its system. The direct cost for a family of four is about $500 per year. However, that is not the whole story, because if that family makes less than $95,000 a year, it will get a rebate of $540. That is right. It will actually come out ahead because of carbon pricing. About 60% of Alberta households receive a full or partial rebate to offset the cost of the carbon levy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494750">External studies have come up with a variety of estimates for what carbon pricing might cost. What these studies tend to agree on is that actual costs depend a lot on how provinces and territories design their carbon pricing systems and how they reinvest carbon pricing revenues back into the economy. Some households will face costs, but others will come out ahead financially, depending on the choices in each jurisdiction. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494751">The Conservative opposition knows that, despite all this misdirection and pointless droning on on this point. It knows that the federal government has asked the provinces and territories to confirm the details of their systems by September, and it knows that wherever the federal system applies, all direct revenues will be returned to the jurisdiction of origin. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494752">What the Conservatives may not know, and what they do not seem to care about, is just how expensive inaction on climate change could prove to be. Estimates suggest that climate change could cost Canada $5 billion a year by 2020 and as much as $43 billion by 2050. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494753">With that in mind, I would like to conclude my remarks with some reflection on a quote earlier this month by Steve Williams, the CEO of Canada's largest oil company, Suncor.

              <ParaText id="5494770">Madam Speaker, carbon pricing is key to any credible climate plan, because it is a cost-effective way to significantly reduce pollution while driving clean innovation and creating new jobs. A price on carbon creates a powerful incentive to cut pollution. It encourages people and businesses to save money by making cleaner choices, such as better insulating their homes or upgrading to more efficient equipment. Carbon pricing is a foundation of Canada's clean growth and climate action plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494771"> Four out of five Canadians live in a jurisdiction that is already pricing pollution today. By ensuring that all parts of Canada price pollution to the same standard, we will help ensure that we drive down our emissions and grow our economy. The clearer, more consistent, strong, and predictable the price signal, the greater its effectiveness in driving the choices that contribute to the transition to a low-carbon economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494772">There are three main carbon pricing systems in Canada: cap and trade, a carbon tax or other form of charge on fossil fuels, and a hybrid system. The federal carbon pollution pricing system will use a hybrid approach that consists of two components: a charge on fossil fuels that will generally be paid by fuel producers or distributors, and a performance-based system for industrial facilities. It will be considered to be a regulatory fuel charge, as it will be aimed at changing behaviours. Putting a price on carbon pollution will create an incentive for businesses and consumers to make lower-carbon choices.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5494776">Part 1 of the act sets out the details on the fuel charge, which would generally be payable by a fuel distributor or a fuel producer who can be expected to pass on that cost to the end-user of the fuel in the form of an increased purchase price, thereby creating a price signal throughout the Canadian economy. The rates of the fuel charge are set out in schedule 2 of the act. This part will be administered by the Canada Revenue Agency. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494777">Part 2 establishes the performance-based system for industrial facilities with high emissions that are also trade exposed. This system is designed to provide a price signal and incent reductions while minimizing competitiveness in carbon leakage risks. Instead of paying the fuel charge in part 1 on fuels that they purchase, industrial facilities will face a compliance cost on only a portion of their emissions, the amount by which they exceed a regulated limit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494778">The annual emissions limit for a facility that carries out a regulated activity will be based on an emissions intensity standard for that activity. Standards will generally be in the form of emissions per unit of production. Regulations will set different standards for different activities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494779">As an example of how this will work, a standard could be set at one tonne of CO2 emissions per unit of production for a particular regulated activity. A facility that carries out the regulated activity would have an annual limit that is equal to one tonne of carbon emissions multiplied by the number of units that the facility produces in that year. This will create an incentive for facilities to produce as efficiently as possible, in other words, to reduce their emissions per unit of production. This will drive energy efficiency and switching to cleaner fuels.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494780">If a facility emits less than the limit, it will receive surplus credits that it can bank for future use or sell to other regulated firms. The system thus creates an incentive for continuous improvement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494781">Facilities that emit above their limit will need to provide compensation for the portion of their emissions above their annual limit using one of three methods. First, facilities can submit surplus credits that they earned in previous years or acquired from another facility. Second, facilities can submit offset credits from projects that prevent emissions or that remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Third, facilities can pay a charge equivalent to the price of the federal standard carbon price. This price is set at $10 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2018 and will rise by $10 annually until it reaches $50 per tonne in 2022.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494782">Facilities will be required to open accounts in a tracking system to buy, sell, and use credits. The tracking system in part 2 will also register payments of the excess emissions charge. The actual performance standards for each sector will be prescribed in regulations. Officials from the Department of Environment and Climate Change are in the process of engaging with industry and other interested stakeholders on the development of these standards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494783">Wherever the federal carbon pricing system applies, the Government of Canada will return all direct revenue made from the carbon price to the jurisdiction of origin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494784">Part 1 and part 2 each contain administrative sections, such as provisions on registration, compliance reporting, confidentiality of information, and record-keeping for the proper functioning of the federal system. To ensure timely payment of the carbon price and compliance with the other requirements of the federal system, part 1 and part 2 each contain enforcement provisions, including penalties, offences, and debt collection provisions tailored to the specific component in each part.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494785">The act requires the <Affiliation DbId="214310" Type="4">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation> to report annually to Parliament on the administration of the act. This is in addition to the commitment in the pan-Canadian framework for annual reports on the overall implementation of the framework and a joint federal-provincial-territorial review of the overall approach to pricing carbon in Canada by early 2022 to confirm the path forward, with an interim review in 2020.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5494786">Pricing carbon pollution is one of the key actions that will put Canada on a course to meet our 2030 emissions reduction target, but it is not the only action. Canada's clean growth and climate action plan includes many other measures across the economy that complement carbon pricing to cut emissions. These include phasing out coal-fired power; improving the energy efficiency of buildings, vehicles, and industries; and cutting methane emissions from the oil and gas sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494787">The government is also making significant investments to enable Canadian businesses and workers to participate in the trillion-dollar opportunities offered by the world's transition to a clean growth economy. In June 2017, the $1.4 billion low-carbon economy leadership fund was launched to support provincial and territorial projects for buildings, industry, forestry, and agriculture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494788">In December 2017, the first set of projects was announced and many are now under way. On March 14, 2018, the low-carbon economy challenge was launched. The challenge will provide up to $500 million for projects that generate clean growth and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Provinces, territories, businesses, municipalities, not-for-profit organizations, and indigenous communities can apply. The government is also investing billions of dollars in green infrastructure and public transit. The Canada Infrastructure Bank and Export Development Canada are using innovative financing mechanisms, like green bonds, to support climate investments and help new technologies become mainstream.</ParaText>

Forgive me for being skeptical about having direct revenues go back to the provinces, but it is on the issue of the GST, which is critical. Effectively what the carbon tax plan proposes is that the Liberals continue to charge the GST on the price of the carbon tax, in other words, creating a tax on top of a tax.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5494803">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to this opposition motion. This motion is about transparency, but it is also about the lack of clarity by the government on this carbon tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494804">I want to talk a bit about how the carbon tax affects my riding of Peace River—Westlock in northern Alberta. Northern Alberta is a pretty cold place. There are about five days a year over 30°C and the rest of the year is much colder than that. There is about a four-month growing season and beyond that, it is winter, still winter, and almost winter. Those are three seasons in northern Alberta.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494805">When it comes to what the carbon tax costs average Canadian families, my region will be affected more than others because furnaces there run more than anywhere else in the country. In Alberta, natural gas has gone up by one-quarter of the price. It was $3 a gigajoule before and now it is $4 a gigajoule. That translates to hundreds of dollars more every month for heat in northern Alberta, and that is the direct cost to families in heat alone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494806">The gentleman who spoke before me talked about how the carbon tax would be a direct cost of $500 per family. That is the direct cost, just on heating bills. In northern Alberta, the carbon tax is much more than $500 per family, but maybe that is the average for all of Canada. That seems fair as a direct cost. We do not know, however, because the government has redacted the entire document that the finance department created for this new initiative for a carbon tax in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494807">It is the other things that trickle down that have a detrimental effect not only on individual Canadian families but our entire economy. The thing about the carbon tax is that it will be put on heating and transportation. Then and there, that makes everything more expensive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494808"> The government runs around and says that it stands up for supply management and the steel industry in Canada, yet it does not seem to realize that a carbon tax will affect all of these communities and industries significantly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494809">Before I go any further, I forgot to mention that I would love to share my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="214534" Type="2">Barrie—Innisfil</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494810">I was recently in Sault Ste. Marie. The carbon tax there is a significant competitive disadvantage for the steel industry. The natural gas that goes to Sault Ste. Marie to heat the steel comes from western Canada. It is imperative that the steel industry in Sault Ste. Marie is viable because a huge amount of natural gas from western Canada is sold to Sault Ste. Marie to heat the steel that is used in northern Alberta to drill in the oil patch and produce energy for the entire world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494811">The cost of the carbon tax is then translated throughout the economy on percentages. Doing business is all about margins and people calculate the margins based on their costs. When the costs increase, margins increase because it is typically a percentage of the cost. When suppliers to particular industries have the increased cost of the carbon tax, they will all increase their rates. We have seen this in Alberta with the trucking companies. When the carbon tax came in, some companies increased their rates by 8%, other companies just added a fuel surcharge, and others added the carbon tax in their basic rates. Shipping to my area is 8% more expensive. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494812">Garbage collection in the town of Falher went up 8%. The town had to redo its budget because the garbage collection company said that the quote it submitted was no longer good because it had to pay the carbon tax. The Town of Whitecourt said that just heating its publicly owned buildings was going to cost $100,000 more a year, just in heat alone. That is exactly why we need—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5494822">Madam Speaker, I understand why the Liberals would want to interrupt my great speech. I was telling them exactly how this carbon tax was affecting my northern Alberta communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494823">This carbon tax will cost Canadians exponentially, as I was explaining earlier, particularly around the trucking costs. Up in northern Alberta, bringing food in is a significant cost, often because the food will sit on the truck for eight or nine hours.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494824"> That says nothing about what the carbon tax will cost our farmers. One of the major inputs to our farmers is both the fuel and the fertilizer. Both of these things will have significant amounts of carbon tax on them. This will make it so our food is more expensive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494825"> I do not know if members know this, but all our food is grown by farmers across Canada. It is important that our farmers maintain viability. When a carbon tax is put on our farmers, they are placed at a competitive disadvantage with farmers around the world. We are already at somewhat of a competitive disadvantage just given the location in which we live. It is a cold climate and not as many things grow in northern Alberta as in some of the other places in the world. However, we have a thriving agriculture sector, yet the Liberals are imposing a carbon tax on farmers and, at the same time, saying they stand up for farmers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494826">One of the huge costs to farming is the fuel, and we see a significant increase in the fuel costs, never mind the heating. When the crops come off the field and are a bit too wet, we have to dry them out, and that uses a lot of natural gas and propane. If we increase the cost of natural gas by a complete quarter, 25%, that is a huge cost that will be borne out by our farmers. They say that the farmers might be able to manage this, that they might be able to remain viable. Sure, they will probably increase the price of their product, but what does is make food across the country more expensive. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5494827">If the Liberals were actually trying to make lives better for the average, everyday Canadian in the middle class, and those working hard to join it, as the Liberals continually trumpet, they would not be imposing a carbon tax. That, in and of itself, proves the point that we need to know what this carbon tax will cost the average, everyday Canadian. The Liberals have blacked that out on the document we have been provided, and are unwilling to tell Canadians what the benefits of the carbon tax are and what it will cost everyday Canadians.</ParaText>

I was told that he had an innate sense of politics that he had inherited from his great-great grandfather, Honoré Mercier, the ninth premier of Quebec, and that is true too. I was also told that, like his mentor Claude Ryan, he could assimilate and synthesize the news and quickly determine what the political implications would be, and that is also true.</ParaText>

Fight he did, first in winning a riding that pundits never tired of calling an unassailable Liberal fortress, then in confirming that win in the 2008 general election, proving that the by-election was not a fluke.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495157">It is a privilege and an honour, but also an immense responsibility, to be elected here to the House. He has served his constituents and supporters across the country with dignity and respect, and we thank him for that.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="5495158">While he has served here in the House of Commons, he has also served as Quebec's minister of sustainable development, environment and parks. On the federal level, he has served as the NDP House leader, Quebec lieutenant, and, finally, leader of the official opposition in the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495159">However, his most lasting contribution, the moment at which he truly changed this Parliament for future generations, is when he had the courage to stand for what he believed in, speak truth to power, do politics differently, and refuse to shave, ever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495160">Dare I say that not since Abraham Lincoln have such wonderful whiskers become so entwined with a political personality. Legend has it that the moment he became the leader of Canada's New Democrats, Gillette's stock took a tumble. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495161">Look how far we have come.

              <ParaText id="5495162">Of course, the member is much more than a political trendsetter. While the member proved how skilled he was in the House of Commons, mainly at the expense of my former government, that is not my lasting memory. I will always remember the member for two things: his humour and his humanity. I say humour, because who else would dress up as an Angry Bird on Halloween? His appearances at the press gallery dinner were the best. As well, we knew he had that quick smile and the Irish twinkle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495163">I do remember one time when I wish I had been able to warn the member about something. He once appeared in a ball pit with presenter Mark Critch on <I>This Hour Has 22 Minutes</I>. Having cleaned ball pits for 17 years, I should have told him before then never to go into a ball pit. Parents in the House of Commons understand what I am talking about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495164">On the humanity side, in the 10 years I have been in the House with the member, we have shared grief, losing both Jack Layton and our dear friend Jim Flaherty. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495165">I can also say that my first encounter with the member showed humanity as well. There was a story in the <I>National Post</I> about our humble beginnings. Indeed, the member started his first job at 14, working nine-hour days in a textile factory in Montreal. He approached me after the story appeared, because it had noted that I, as well, started at 14, working in a Dairy Queen for very long hours.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495166">It made me have an instant connection with the member, and it reminds me that even though we had differences of opinion, and even though he called for my resignation many times, we do share many common bonds.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495168">Catherine has always been incredibly warm and kind to me.

It has been quite a while since we were putting docks in the water, my goodness, but I have always appreciated this passionate and brilliant man. I am also grateful to him.

Sometimes Liberal, sometimes Conservative, sometimes NDP, he is a Quebecker.

              <ParaText id="5495174">Elected as an NDP member in 2007, he preceded the orange wave that swept through Quebec in 2011, a great win by his friend Jack Layton. He set himself apart as soon as he was elected. He appeared in every forum speaking intelligently on all kinds of topics, cracking jokes at the right times, expressing outrage for the right reasons, making insightful comments, and coming up with the killer line that would take out his opponent. He was the goon, the NDP’s own Claude Lemieux. None of the other teams can stand him, but everyone wants to have him on theirs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495175">I honestly and sincerely believe that the NDP is losing its best and most formidable debater today. He would have made his illustrious and legendary forefather Honoré Mercier proud. Formidable, incisive and hard-hitting, frankly, the man we salute today has been a stand-up Quebecker throughout his career, and we thank him for his contribution.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495181">I also want to say that the relationship informed a lot of of who the member is today. The most moving speech I ever heard my friend, the member for <Affiliation DbId="213985" Type="2">Outremont</Affiliation>, give was on the occasion of remembrance of the Shoah. It was a very emotional recollection of going back to the very barn in the fields of France where his wife's mother hid throughout the Holocaust, descendants of Sephardic Jews hiding in a barn from the Nazi regime of Vichy, France. I do not think I have ever heard any words on the occasion of remembrance of the Shoah that were more keenly felt and brought us back to the individual cases and enormous horrors and evil of that period.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495221">Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="213985" Type="2">Outremont</Affiliation>. It is often difficult to stand after we hear these types of speeches to say goodbye. My experience with the hon. member has been nothing but professional and courteous. I remember, after being first elected, having a chance to meet him. In fact, everyone who visited me on the Hill would always want to meet the hon. member for Outremont. My wife just texted me and said that she would miss his smile. Certainly, she will miss him in question period. I wish him and his family well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495222">Last week, the people of Ontario sent a warning shot across the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s bow. It related to the carbon tax in particular. We are here on this opposition day with our motion to find out how much the carbon tax will cost the average Canadian family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495223"> During question period, the minister tabled some documents from an April 30 report, basically propaganda from the government, talking about emissions and all kinds of things. However, nothing talked to the issue at hand, which is that the government knows how much a carbon tax will cost the average Canadian family and it refuses to tell Canadians and the House. In fact, I would guess that the question on how much the carbon tax will cost Canadians has been asked 200-plus times, and not just in the House but at various committees. The Liberals still refuse to answer that question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495224">Therefore, we are here today, once again, asking the question, and as the member for <Affiliation DbId="214462" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> said, we are quite prepared to stay here most of the night to get the answers to the questions for which Canadians are looking. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495225">We also know that just before the last election in Ontario, an Ipsos poll, specifically relating to the carbon tax was done. That poll found that 72% of people in Ontario saw the carbon tax as a tax grab, and 68% thought it would have no meaningful impact on the environment at all. The only poll that matters, quite frankly, was last Thursday when Ontarians sent a strong and clear message, not just to the Kathleen Wynn government but also to the federal government, that they would not to buy into this carbon tax scam. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495226">This is a government that when first elected spoke about transparency and accountability. Oftentimes in the House I have thrown the Liberals' throne speech back at them. I heard the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214586" Type="2">Barrie—Springwater—Oro-Medonte</Affiliation> throw the throne speech back at them as well. The Liberals talked about transparency and accountability several times in the throne speech. They said that they would be the most open and transparent government in the history of the country, yet their actions have shown nothing to that order. They are not being transparent and accountable on how much a carbon tax will cost the average Canadian family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495227">Here is what we do know, but they will not tell us this. It will to cost 11¢ a litre for fuel. For the residents of Barrie—Innisfail, who commute up and down the 400, and for all those families involved in sports, taking their kids to hockey and soccer, that means 11¢ more a litre to fill up their tanks. I have four children. My son played AAA hockey. I had other sons who played representative hockey. It costs a lot to travel all over Ontario and have to pay for fuel, and yet the government, through its carbon tax, is proposing 11¢ a litre more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495228"> We also know it will cost $200 a year more to heat our homes, $200 more that people can least afford. Think of the impact that will have on seniors. Think of the impact that will have disproportionately on young families, or single-income families that have to heat their homes, take their kids to dance lessons, hockey, baseball, or soccer. Whatever it is, it will cost them a lot more to pay for the carbon tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495229">In a report that recently came out, the PBO talked about $10 billion being taken out of the economy by 2022. However, that number could actually be higher. It could be $35 billion taken out of the economy.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5495230">We are talking about competitiveness in our economy, and in an era of being uncompetitive, at least on this side, with increasing taxes and increasing regulatory requirements, when our biggest trading partner in the south is going in the completely opposite direction, how it is going to impact families in a negative way. It is going to impact businesses in a negative way. It will, in fact, have a cascading effect on our economy, because the price of everything is going to go up, not just the price of fuel, as people in B.C. have seen, but also the price of everything that is manufactured, everything that is delivered, and everything people consume, including groceries. There will be an impact because of this carbon tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495231">One thing that is not mentioned that often but that is quickly becoming apparent to Canadians is that the government intends to have the GST collected on top of the carbon tax. I know that the Liberals' narrative is that they are going to send all that money back to the provinces, but in fact, the GST that is going to be collected on top of the carbon tax will all be revenue that will come back to the federal government. It is revenue the Liberals will continue to spend on programs that they feel are important to them and not necessarily programs that are important to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495232">When we talk about the impact on families with respect to this carbon tax, there will be some who will be insulated from it. Those people sit on the other side. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> will feel zero impact from this carbon tax. He has a taxpayer-subsidized home and a taxpayer-subsidized driver. He pays nothing, while middle-class families will be buried, and those who are disproportionately affected, lower-middle-income families, are going to be paying more for this tax. The <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>, who comes from business and from means, will feel no impact as a result of this carbon tax, because again, he has a taxpayer-funded driver. He will not be paying 11¢ a litre. Of course, the <Affiliation DbId="214310" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation>, who we see often in this House stand up and talk about the calamity that is going to come if there is no carbon tax with respect to the environment, will be just fine as well. The ones who will not be fine are those middle-class families that will have to pay more, and disproportionately, those lower-income families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495233">It should be no surprise to any of us who live in Ontario that we are on a similar path. We saw last week, as I mentioned earlier, the Kathleen Wynne government, after 15 years, literally get booted out of office, reduced to non-party status. There is a reason for that. We find the current federal Liberal government, this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, his cabinet, and his caucus on that same path. It is the same playbook of debt and deficits that was used in Ontario, with the scandals, including cash for access, the gas-plant scandal, which was similar to the pipeline purchase we just saw, and insiders making money from the government green energy program, and the list goes on and on. We are heading down the same path of debt and deficits that people can ill afford. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495234">Again, what we are spending all day doing is asking one simple question on behalf of the Canadians who sent us here: what will the carbon tax cost the average Canadian family? The Liberals refuse to tell us. They have documents that have been blacked out. We know that the information has to be known to the government. The challenge for the Liberals right now is that they are fearful of releasing that information on just how much it is going to cost Canadian families, because they do not want Canadian families to know how much it is going to cost. The political implications for the current Liberal government are similar to the political implications we saw last week in Ontario, where the Liberal government lost an election, overwhelmingly, because of bad policies, both fiscal and social, and those that are affecting middle-income families, all families, for that matter, and we will not stand for it. We want that information, and Canadians deserve to see it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495243">Is there something else we could do? For example, has the member heard of a cleaner way to develop the tar sands? Is that something he would like to see? I suppose I should use the term “oil sands” to eliminate the negative connotation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495244">Currently, this energy source is a monster emitter since domestic natural gas is used to heat the water, create steam, and extract the oil from the sand. Could he propose a solution other than this incentive, which is a proven solution?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495245">Mr. Speaker, the issue of the oil sands comes up quite regularly. I know, in speaking with our shadow minister for natural resources, who has a tremendous amount of experience in the oil sands, that nowhere in the world is there a more sustainable or environmentally sustainable way of extracting oil from the ground than in the oil sands. That has been an issue that has been argued time and time again and has been proven to be the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495246">To the point of an alternative, we hear the <Affiliation DbId="214310" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> stand up and ask all the time, “where is their plan?” We are going to develop a plan. In fact, we are in the process of developing a plan. This is a plan that is not going to cost the average Canadian family for the basic necessities of life. It is going to be a sustainable plan. In fact, during the previous government, we saw emissions go down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495247"> Those targets the government is now looking to implement are the same targets of the previous government. I do not know whether it was a faux pas on the part of the environment minister, but during question period, she said that they were not going to meet their targets either. Clearly, the government has no intention of reaching those targets. The only thing the Liberals plan to do is tax Canadians disproportionately, especially those who can least afford the carbon tax.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495249">Canadians understand that polluting the air we breathe and the earth and the oceans that feed us must come at a cost to those who pollute. That is because they incur real costs for all Canadians. These costs are incurred through drought, smog, wild fires, and the effects pollution has on water, food, and the air we breathe. The price we pay is for our health and our future. The financial costs of pollution for Canadians are also very real. Last year in the Pontiac, my constituents felt it first-hand with the floods that ravaged our region. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495250">Climate change alone is expected to cost Canadians $5 billion a year by 2020. We know that pricing pollution is the most effective way to reduce the emissions that bring about these costs, because it creates incentives for businesses and households to innovate and pollute less. That is why putting a price on carbon pollution is so central to our government's plan to fight climate change while at the same time growing the economy, creating jobs for the middle class and those working so hard to join it, and creating a better future for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495251">The idea here is really simple, and the average Canadian does understand this. We are putting a price on what we do not want, which is carbon pollution, and we are fostering that which we do want, lower emissions and job creation through innovation in the clean economy. We are putting this plan into place through the greenhouse gas pollution pricing act. With this legislation, the carbon price will be fair and it will be effective. It is based on a practical approach to minimize the impact on the competitiveness of large industries that are emissions intensive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495252">I want to assure the hon. members on both sides of this House that this legislation was not developed in isolation. We know that it was developed through collaboration. We know that it was developed in consultation with the provinces, the territories, and indigenous people. Hand in hand, we have worked towards this plan, and it is an important part of our pan-Canadian framework on clean growth and climate change. I want to commend the <Affiliation DbId="214310" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> for her hard work with colleagues across the country to achieve this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495253">This framework is our plan, developed to meet our emissions reduction targets, to grow the economy, and to build resilience to a changing climate. To support the implementation of this plan, our approach provides provinces and territories with the flexibility to choose between systems: an explicit price-based system, or a cap and trade system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495254"> A price on carbon pollution, as we all know, is already in place in four provinces: Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, and Alberta. These provinces encompass over 80% of the Canadian population. In jurisdictions that do not have a pricing system that meets the federal standard, a federal pricing system will apply as of January 1, 2019, starting at a price of $20 per tonne of emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495255">It is important to note that the direct revenue from the carbon price on pollution under the federal system will go back to the province or territory of origin. I would like to point out to those who suggest that a price on carbon pollution will somehow negatively impact the financial health of Canadians that those provinces that already have a price on carbon pollution are, together, leading the rest of Canada in job growth. We are confident that we are going to see the same positive economic performance in other provinces and territories that have yet to implement carbon pricing systems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495256">I want to focus on the fact that the majority of Canadians understand this already, despite the misinformation from our colleagues in the Conservative Party. The majority of Canadians support this approach. My constituents in the Pontiac support it, and experts support it. There is a strong consensus among economists, scientists, governments around the world, and policy experts that a price on carbon is the single most important policy a government can put in place to deal with climate change. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495257">I would like to take a moment to go to some of the comments I have heard from the Insurance Bureau of Canada, an obviously non-partisan institution that is an expert on the impacts climate change is presently having on our economy. The Insurance Bureau of Canada has publicly stated, repeatedly, that climate change is already costing Canadian taxpayers and home insurance policyholders billions of dollars every year. It has sounded the alarm. Climate change is not some future threat but is very real and a clear and present danger. It has stated publicly that the cost of pricing carbon is dwarfed by the future cost Canadians will face if we do nothing at all.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5495258">Here are its facts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495259">Residential property losses from severe weather have accelerated due to climate change and now total over $1 billion a year on average. Federal disaster relief losses also now average over $1 billion per year, and they continue to escalate, largely driven by climate change. Those are federal numbers only, and they do not even include the losses by provinces and municipalities. I can tell members that in the Pontiac last year, there were millions of dollars lost in property damage and public infrastructure damage due to flooding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495260">As a result of these rising losses, municipalities across the country are investing heavily in adaptation. The City of Toronto alone is investing $1.5 billion to upgrade its stormwater infrastructure to protect residents from the growing threat. Obviously, in the riding that I represent, in the City of Gatineau and over 40 municipalities in rural Pontiac, we are talking about millions of dollars of new investments to protect our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495261">At the end of the day, whether it is taxpayers or insured policyholders, it is the same Canadians who are now bearing the costs of our past inaction on climate change. When I say “our past inaction”, I also mean the party opposite's past inaction. The Conservative government did literally nothing to get our country moving on the right track on this file. That is one of the major reasons that I sought to become elected back in 2015.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495262">With respect, politicians who say that they believe that we have to do something about climate change but not by using a carbon price are no better than those who deny that humans cause climate change or that gravity exists. Frankly, Canadians have no time for one-sided populist rhetoric, the kind of rhetoric that we are hearing from the opposite side right now, and they have no time for the lame partisanship that dumbs down a very serious and important policy debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495263">Climate change is the single most important threat that we are facing in the world today and the science is clear that humans are causing it. If the Conservative Party of Canada has a real alternative to carbon pricing that would be effective, I would love to hear it. However, we know from experience that vague promises and ineffective voluntary actions are going to do nothing to reduce greenhouse gases. The Conservative Party opposite has no plan. It has no plan apart from some specious attempt to score political points on the backs of Canadians. It has no plan apart from a desire to divide and misinform Canadians.</ParaText>

We, the Liberal Party, this government, has a plan. We have a plan to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030, to 517 megatonnes. Along with all the other measures in Canada's clean growth and climate action plan, the pan-Canadian framework for carbon pricing will put Canada on track to meet our 2030 emissions targets, which will help meet our commitments to the global community. This is so fundamental, because greenhouse gases know no national boundaries. By putting a price on carbon, we are going to join 67 other jurisdictions that have already taken this important step. According to the World Bank, those overseas jurisdictions together represent half of the global economy and more than a quarter of global GHG emissions. Therefore, together we are going to make the world a better place. To act otherwise would be a total dereliction of our duty as federal lawmakers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495273">Mr. Speaker, it was interesting that the hon. member did talk about the $10 carbon tax that is coming now as it goes up to $50. Of course, the PBO's April 2018 economic outlook talked about that. It also talked about the cost as far as agriculture was concerned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495274">With the information that had actually come from the ag census 2016, as well as the national inventory report of 2017, where they took an average farm. I have the information on an average farm for Alberta and one for Prince Edward Island. Basically, the costs for a farm in Alberta of about 855 acres and a farm in P.E.I. of about 323 acres, starts off in 2018 in Alberta that it will cost $3,464, and it continues up to 2022 to $17, 321 that it will cost that farm. In P.E.I. it goes from $2,500 this coming year up to $12,446. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495275">The Liberals always say there is an opportunity for that to then go to the consumer. However, that is not exactly how agriculture works. It is going to stay on the farm. They are the ones who are going to be dealing with that. I am sure if a person did a little extra work, they could probably figure out what the actual costs will be for every family as well, but these are usually farm families who are associated with this. They will also have the added numbers that we are not able to get from the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495276">I wonder if the member could talk about the damage that is going to happen to farm families and farmers in general, without talking about some of the other talking points that they have, and how they are helping out in the farming industry by dealing with environmental issues.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495285">Mr. Speaker, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214462" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>'s motion is interesting, but one that seems to miss the point on at least two levels. First, as has been pointed out in the House before, pricing carbon pollution is widely acknowledged as one of the most important tools for combatting climate change. That is because it follows a classic economic principle. If we want to encourage certain kinds of activity, provide an incentive for doing more of it. If we want to discourage an activity such as producing carbon, we create a disincentive so that there is less of it. This is well understood because it just makes sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495286">It is certainly understood by the more than 42 countries that have adopted some form of carbon pricing. It is understood by some 25 subnational jurisdictions that have done the same. Indeed, the number of carbon pricing initiatives that have been implemented or planned for implementation has almost doubled since 2013. Among those pricing or planning to price carbon are the European Union, China, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Colombia, and California, just to name a few.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495287">In the case of China, that country has tested a cap-and-trade system in nine of its 23 provinces. The plan is to take the system national and when that happens, fully one-quarter of the world's carbon emissions will be priced at one level or another. The opposition increasingly finds itself on the outside looking in, outside of a growing consensus sweeping the globe, outside of the economic mainstream that wants to discourage the production of carbon by pricing it, outside of nation after nation and state after state that know that this is the best, most effective way to reduce carbon pollution. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495288">Nor is it just governments that have seen the wisdom of putting a price on carbon, so too have companies. Indeed, the private sector, that same private sector that the opposition claims to understand and represent, has been calling on governments to price carbon for years. Many are not waiting. By last year, more than 1,300 companies had implemented or were planning to implement internal carbon pricing. That is up from 150 just four years ago. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495289">Why is that? If pricing carbon pollution is so devastating, why are companies jumping on board? What do they know that the opposition does not? They understand the benefits to their businesses. They know that it is the best way of achieving the desired public policy objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. That is the free market in action. That is how forward-thinking companies are dealing with the challenges and opportunities of climate change. They are turning the genius of free enterprise to finding creative and innovative ways to avoid disincentives. Again, it is just Economics 101. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495290">Our government believes in the free market system. By sending clear market signals, we are unleashing its power to tackle greenhouse gas emissions, spurring innovation and improving our competitiveness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495291">These clear market signals do something else as well. They encourage companies to look for better ways of doing things including using different sources of energy and using less energy overall. That is critical, because the International Energy Agency has said that we can get halfway to our Paris commitments just by using energy more efficiently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495292"> I would also remind the House that pricing carbon pollution is something that the United Nations is championing. It has challenged companies to "reach the next level of climate performance and to advocate for a price on carbon as a necessary and effective measure to tackle the climate change challenge." </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495293">Why is this obvious to everyone but members of the opposition? Why do they not get it? Why do they not see what everyone else does, that pricing carbon pollution must be part of the solution to climate change? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495294">That is the first problem with this motion, it misses the point by missing the boat, by opposing a tool that the world is embracing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495295"> Second, it misses the point by overlooking one of the key features of our carbon pricing proposal, that revenue from pricing pollution will not end up in Ottawa. All direct revenues collected by our government will be returned to the province or territory they came from.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495296">Governments in Canada today are investing carbon pricing revenues in rebates and tax cuts for households. They are supporting competitiveness for industry and investing in climate action, clean technology, and innovation. Those are the kinds of wise investments our government is making today.</ParaText>

While you have rightly said, Mr. Speaker, that the government has some latitude in determining the form that the request will take initially, that does not mean the government has freedom once it has decided on the form of that request and sent it to committee and they have been deemed reported back, that the government then has a wide-ranging prerogative to change the nature of that request for funding, which is what is happening currently in the appropriation bill as it is worded.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495335">As always, it is an honour to rise in this place to represent my constituents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495336">This is an important topic. It is not a secret that the Liberal government believes strongly in its carbon tax. In fact, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has extended, some would say overextended, all of his political capital to create a national carbon tax for all of Canada, or almost all of Canada. One province has refused, another just rejected it, and possibly more will be rejecting it after upcoming elections. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495337">That is ultimately the problem, because the whole theory to carbon tax is that when people become so financially crippled that they can no longer afford to buy gasoline, they will in turn use less of it. By extension, they will burn less carbon, and that will lower our greenhouse gas emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495338">Even where a carbon tax has existed the longest, which is in my home province of British Columbia, greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise. Many say that means it is a failure. The elites and the experts will say it is failing only because the carbon tax is not nearly high enough. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495339">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was quoted as saying that high gas prices “are exactly what we want”. He meant specifically to encourage people to financially suffer to the point where they can no longer afford to buy gasoline, and thus use less of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495340">Here is the problem with that theory: democracy. I would submit to this place that when people are pushed to the brink of not being able to afford things like gasoline that they need in their everyday lives, and this applies to all of society, they will vote out the carbon tax. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495341">This is a big part of what happened in the recent Ontario election. Gerald Butts' fingerprints are all over Ontario for driving up costs on everyday Canadians. It is not a secret that he is now following the same formula while running the federal Liberal government. Let us look at this motion as an example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495342">The entire premise for a carbon tax to work is that prices get so high people can no longer afford to use as much gasoline. The federal Liberal government has in its possession documents that clearly show how much the Department of Finance believes this national carbon tax will cost Canadian families. What does Gerald Butts do? He orders that this information be kept secret from the very Canadians who will be forced to pay it. Why is that? Let me ask the question another way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495343">When Canadians are told that the government is hiding information from them related to a tax that they are being forced to pay, what will they say in response? Every person in this room knows the answer to that question. They will say it enrages them, especially when it comes from a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who had promised to be “Mr. Transparency”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495344">What was that quote again? Oh yes, “sunlight is the best disinfectant”. Where is the sunlight here? It seems to have gone the way of sunny ways. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495345">Here is the other thing, though. It is not just everyday Canadians. Here is another example I will share from a different perspective. In 2008, at the time the B.C. carbon tax was first introduced, basically 100% of all cement used in British Columbia was manufactured in British Columbia. Why not? Concrete is not exactly a lightweight, inexpensive product to import and then transport to other jurisdictions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495346">What happened when B.C.-produced concrete became subject to a carbon tax in 2008? Well, naturally, it became more expensive. By 2014, B.C.-produced concrete only accounted for roughly 65% of all concrete used in British Columbia, because cheaper concrete was being imported from jurisdictions with no carbon tax. That is a 35% loss of market share in B.C.'s own market. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495347">As a result of this, the B.C. government is now providing provincial subsidies to the B.C. concrete industry. There actually is a term for this now, and it is called carbon leakage.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5495348">Here is how carbon leakage is defined in the B.C. NDP 2018 budget document:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495349">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2"> ...industries that compete with industry in countries that may have low or no carbon price. If BC industry loses market share to more polluting competitors, known as carbon leakage, it affects our economy and does not reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. </QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495350">This is a flat-out admission that carbon taxes do not work because they create carbon leakage. Where do members think the term “carbon leakage” is found in the budget document? Subsidies and exemptions cost everyday taxpayers money. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495351">Where is the carbon leakage exemption for the average hard-working Canadian family? We all know there is no carbon tax exemption or relief for anything. Heck, the current Liberal government will not even tell people how much it will cost them. This is why the member for <Affiliation DbId="214462" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> has put this motion forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495352">What is this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> afraid of? Is he afraid that if Canadians learn the true costs of his carbon tax, they might not vote for him in the next election? Is he worried his brand might take another hit at the polls? Surely, for a Liberal government whose number one favourite talking point is that the environment and the economy go hand in hand, one would think the Liberals would be proud to release the true costs of what they say will save the environment. This Prime Minister tells us that the carbon tax is necessary to save the environment, yet when we ask how much greenhouse-gas emissions will actually be reduced because of his carbon tax, he cannot say.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495353">To recap, Canadians are basically being told that yes, the Liberals are making them pay a carbon tax; no, they will not tell them how much it will cost them, and no, they cannot tell them how much it will reduce greenhouse gas emissions either. Seriously, is it any wonder a growing number of Canadians are opposing and rejecting this carbon tax? Most of them have never even heard of carbon leakage or the fact that large-scale industrial greenhouse gas emitters are increasingly getting an exemption or a subsidy from the carbon tax while there is nothing for the average Canadian.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495354">Fortunately, in this case we know that the Office of the Information Commissioner has now launched an investigation to determine why the data about the financial costs of a carbon tax per household are not being released to Canadians. We also know that this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> does not have a super-stellar record with independent officers of Parliament, typically because he believes he can do whatever he wants without consequence and regardless of the rules. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495355">In this case, there is what is right and what is wrong. If the members of the current Liberal government believe strongly in their carbon tax, and I believe that many of them strongly do, then they should not be afraid to tell Canadians what the Department of Finance officials believe this carbon tax will cost them. That is the right thing to do. Sadly, all we know is that the government has once again whipped its members into doing precisely what Mr. Butts wants them to do, and that is to hide the cost of the carbon tax from Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495356">I do not really believe members on the government side do not see the problem with hiding the most basic information from Canadians on a signature policy from this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. We can only surmise that the information is being hidden because the Prime Minister has his own reasons to do so. I suppose if the current Liberal government wants to hide the true cost of its policies from Canadians who are left to pay the bills, so be it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495357">I disagree with that type of governance. I would encourage all members of this place to send a message to this Prime Minister and his inner circle, asking them to be that ray of sunshine, to serve as the disinfectant, to provide transparency, and to support this motion from the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214462" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495358"> These are important debates. Let us not shy away from sharing the information and then letting Canadians pick a side. When people are told what the situation is, given the information so they can digest it, and hear from both views, they are in the best position to make that choice. Every election cycle, we trust them to make the right choice. I believe the people are never wrong. What is wrong with letting the people of this House and of this country have that information, and letting them decide whom they want to believe and which policy is in our national interest?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495361">Mr. Speaker, it is very easy to answer this question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495362">First of all, I do not have feelings about climate change because, again, I believe science. If we look at the science and modelling, there are some inconsistencies, but I believe there is a broad consensus among scientists that 2°C of increased temperature across the globe may happen. We cannot say when, and we also cannot say that a particular event was or was not caused because of human activity. Again, our modelling does not allow that. However, I will say that we do understand human behaviour. We actually have a discipline called economics. We actually can tell what the average cost is of a tax, whether it be an income tax on an average family, whether it be a carbon tax. That information is available to the Department of Finance and to the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495363"> We actually have a redacted report showing that after the election the Liberals received that exact briefing, yet the information has been blacked out, making it difficult for members of Parliament like myself to be able to look constituents in the eye and tell them that we know what the implications of this tax are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495364">If we care about this country, then we should be able to trust the people on both sides of the aisle to have that information so we can debate on a level playing field, which I hope the member supports.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495367">Mr. Speaker, I have a lot of respect for my friend from British Columbia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495368">He knows as well as I do that in the last five years we have had record forest fires raging through the province of British Columbia and through the province of Alberta. In my home community, we have had drought and flooding which is costing our communities significant amounts of money. The PBO is projecting that it is going to cost us $5 billion a year by 2020, and $90 billion by 2050, if we do not mitigate the impacts of climate change. This issue is real.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495369">I did not hear my friend and colleague talk about solutions and ways forward in tackling climate change. We both come from British Columbia, where the provincial Liberal government under Gordon Campbell actually took leadership. It is one of the things that I will actually give them credit for. Back in 2008, the provincial government implemented their first carbon tax. That government was primarily federal Conservatives under a provincial banner. I am sure the member will agree with me on that. In fact, the Green-NDP coalition has just increased it by another $5. The carbon tax is at $35.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495370">That is not what is causing the biggest impact on middle-class Canadians. I would say that people throughout British Columbia would like to see further action to address climate change because of these historic events that we have never seen before in terms of flooding and forest fires, and climate change.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5495372">Mr. Speaker, first of all, the Conservatives are saying that if the government wants to tax, then it needs to give parliamentarians the information so we can debate it and let Canadians decide. That is number one. That is the main focus of today's debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495373">Number two, the member may recall that I actually said that the B.C. NDP government in the 2018 budget actually referred to carbon leakage as being a concern. The pulp and paper mills in British Columbia are very carbon sensitive. Again, that increase from $30 to $35 is already having a remarkable impact on their ability to compete internationally. I believe that this will now be juxtaposed against extra subsidies to those industries. They are setting that context.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495374">When it comes to climate change, there are a lot of other questions that we may have. John Tirole, who is a Nobel Prize economist, has said before that when a country such as Canada, or even a province such as British Columbia, puts a dollar of effort against climate change, but we only account for 2% of the total emissions around the world, that is like saying we will put in a dollar and two cents will go into a savings account to help fight it. What we are doing is we are actually paying the free-riders of countries that do not have those laws and regulations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495375">We need to have a discussion about how the world is working on this and, to tell the truth, the non-binding mandate of the Paris Agreement allows for countries to make pledges that they may not have any intention of meeting. There are a lot of things to unpack in that question. I would say, let us start in our legislative assemblies in the provinces and here in Parliament, and give parliamentarians the information, so that we can actually have the proper debate.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5495376">Mr. Speaker, there is a principle that many of us abide by, certainly on this side of the aisle, and that is no taxation without representation. That is essentially the function of Parliament at this point in time. If we are going to tax the people we represent, then we are accountable to them for how we spend their money. We should be able to explain what sort of impact collecting revenue from them and then spending it will have on their lives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495377">The situation that is at the core of the motion today is that the government has implemented a very punitive tax on Canadians and is taxing them without information. We have taxation without information. Let me explain what I am talking about. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495378">There was a departmental note entitled “Impact of a carbon price on households' consumption costs across the income distribution”. It was presented to the Liberal government after the election. The Conservative Party of Canada asked for a copy of the document, because ostensibly it is what the government's carbon tax is predicated on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495379">Again, the government made a decision to impose a tax on Canadians. This is the information it provided about what the cost would be to average households. As the opposition, we should be able to have that information so that we can represent our constituents and see whether this policy instrument will work and what the opportunity cost would be, the cost of taking that money from Canadians through the tax. What would be the return on investment for seeing the cost of goods increase?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495380">I will post this document on my website or my Facebook page later today. When we got it, it was completely redacted. It essentially says, “The cost to Canadian households will be—” and then there is a giant redacted table. It is completely blacked out. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495381">That is the core of the motion today. In order for the House to represent the people who gave us a mandate to be here, and in order to decide whether or not this tax is actually in the best interests of Canadians, we should know the modelling that the government used to determine whether the tax should be implemented now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495382">Based on what I have seen, external economists outside of the public service have certainly said that the carbon tax is going to raise the cost of goods and everything. Let us think about this. Canada is a very large country. It is geographically diverse. We have to travel long distances to get from one place to another. I am thinking about all the people in this place who have to commute from their ridings just to get to Parliament. Never mind the fact that we are agriculture-intensive and a large portion of our economy is based on natural resource extraction. What do all those things use as an input? They use carbon. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495383">I could spend a whole day just talking about the impact on industry and the loss of jobs, but we can push that down to the household level. Because we have to fill up our cars, and because it is cold here and we have to heat our homes, that tax is going to increase the cost to the average Canadian household. Anyone here who has seen the price of gas these days and who makes that puckering sound or shivers when putting gas in the car understands that the carbon tax is impacting people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495384">One of my colleagues got up and waxed eloquent about economics, about supply and demand. He argued that if we put a tax on something, people's demand for it will decrease. What he was arguing was that the carbon tax the Liberals have put in place would actually decrease the demand of Canadians for things like gas, heating, and farm implements. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495385">Here is the problem. The other piece of information the Liberals have that they will not release is the assumption about how much demand will decrease. They are not releasing how much this carbon tax would actually reduce demand. Therefore, we have a double problem here. Anyone who is making that cringing face when filling up the tank right now is still filling up the tank. Why is that? It is because we are in Canada. We have to drive to get to places.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5495386">The price the Liberals have put in place is not going to decrease the demand, but it is going to increase the cost of living for average Canadians. That is the reason why the government will not release this information. It does not want taxation with information. It does not want taxation with representation. Why? It is because the government has a dogmatic, almost religious, zealotry adherence to the carbon tax it has put in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495387">Why is that? It is because its spending is so out of control and its deficit budget is so unimaginably high that it is looking at every possible option to squeeze average Canadians for its poor financial management. It is my job, and the job of everyone else sitting on this side of the House, to say, “No, it stops here.” We need this information. Canadians need this information. The government did not receive a mandate to be completely disrespectful of the hard-earned money that Canadians toil for every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495388">We also understand that this information needs to be used to look at lower-income Canadians. We know that taxes like this have a disproportionately higher cost to people who are making less money. Because they have a lower income and still have the same input costs on things like transit passes, food, and driving, that tax has a higher impact on people like single moms and senior women. That is wrong. That is also our job here, and that is why we need this information. That is why we are prepared to make the government sit here for 24 hours over and over again until it allows taxation with information, not blocks of redacted information. That is ridiculous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495389">The <Affiliation DbId="214310" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation>, the religious, dogmatic climate change spokesperson-in-chief in the House of Commons, stood up today and with great zeal said that she tabled a document on April 30 that shall set us free, except there is absolutely nothing in her document. Members can go on her website and look through it. There is nothing in there that speaks to the cost to Canadian households. Why? It is because this is how the Liberal government operates. It does not want Canadians looking at its books. Why is that? It is because it is a burning dumpster fire that is adding carbon to our environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495390">Anybody who is filling up the tank right now understands what this carbon tax is going to do for people. If we are going to put a consumption tax that would increase the cost of everything to Canadians, one, it had better work, which it does not, and two, Canadians had better buy into it, which they do not. The other thing is that the government would have to account for the fact that it is going to have legal challenges from virtually every province in this country saying no. Every provincial government is going to stand in the way of this carbon tax. I am so pleased to see Ontarians, and soon Albertans, rejecting another barrier to doing business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495391">In closing, let us talk about trade. The government should have been making Canada more competitive, knowing the volatility of the American administration going into the NAFTA talks. What did it do? It put a cash grab in place, making it even more uncertain for investment, which means even more lost jobs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495392">I want that information. Every Canadian has a right to know what was in that document. Canadians have a right to know how much this tax is going to impact them. If we do not do that, if we do not have taxation with representation, then why do any of us have jobs? That government should not.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495394">In regard to the specifics, 80%-plus of Canadians already pay a price on pollution. The Conservatives know that. The member used the example of those who use transit or those who are disadvantaged. A province can provide a subsidy. A good example is the Province of Manitoba, where the Conservative government cut back on Winnipeg transit transfer money. If that transit money is reinstated, the city would not have to increase the cost of fares. Keeping the fares down means that more people are able to afford them. It is up to the provinces. For many of the answers the members across the way want, they need to go to the provinces, maybe run as MLAs or MPPs, and they might be able to get those specific answers.</ParaText>

The leader of my party has stood up and said that a Conservative government does not want to raise taxes on Canadians; it wants them to have more money in their pockets so they can make choices.

              <ParaText id="5495396">Let us talk about the Liberals' spending priorities. Every day, we walked by an $8-million hockey rink that was used for about four or five months. How many bus passes would that have paid for in Winnipeg? There were rubber ducks all over the place. There was $200 million spent to facilitate work permits for people illegally crossing the border from the U.S. into Canada. There was $1 million spent for office renovations. There were limo rides. Those are the priorities of the government, and when the Liberals talk about fiscal prudence, I feel like vomiting. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495398">Mr. Speaker, one thing I am not hearing enough about today is the cost to taxpayers for natural disasters that are a result of climate change. We have seen record numbers of forest fires. We have seen floods like we have never seen before, which the PBO has projected will cost about $5 billion a year, or more, by 2020. There have been even worse years recently.</ParaText>

We are not hearing how they are going to deal with these issues and protect middle-class Canadians. Of course, this tax, and being tax-prudent, is protecting taxpayers, because they are the ones who are going to pick up the tab for these disasters.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495405">Mr. Speaker, it is a great pleasure to rise to speak to this motion. I am going to say many things that my colleagues from Alberta should hear because it is very important for them to be reminded where this idea of a carbon tax or carbon levy came from. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495406">I am a proud Albertan for many reasons and counted among them is the fact that my province was the first Canadian jurisdiction, in fact the first jurisdiction in North America, to impose a levy on carbon emissions. Our colleagues in the Conservative Party, minus the Progressive Conservative aspect of it, seem to want to forget about that. In fact, my guess would be that not a single one of them mentioned that fact during the debate in this place on the carbon tax. In 2007, Premier Stelmach's Progressive Conservative Government of Alberta became the first in Canada, a North America jurisdiction, to legislate greenhouse gas emissions reductions. The specified gas emitters regulation imposed a carbon levy on large industrial emitters. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495407">This came about because of the remarkable institution in Alberta called the Clean Air Strategic Alliance. It is a mechanism that I have long recommended should be duplicated at the federal level. It is a tripartite organization shared jointly by someone senior in industry, maybe a TransAlta, Suncor, or Syncrude vice-president, and by a deputy of energy or environment, and a senior environmentalist. It also includes indigenous peoples and farmers. On behalf of the Alberta government it takes on what should be done to reduce air emissions in our province. The alliance took on the coal-fired power industry and significantly reduced those emissions. It also took on the major emitters of greenhouse gases and as a result, the government very wisely issued these regulations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495408">Those regulations have since been replaced and I will talk about that in a minute, but under those regulations, an industry could choose to either reduce its emissions substantially or contribute to a research fund. That research fund was headed up by the former head of Syncrude Canada. It is considered a great model for investment in cleaner technology. A lot of the money went to try to clean up the fossil fuel industry, which some people might question, but it indeed does also need to clean up. A lot of that money also went into things like geothermal energy, renewable energy, using alternative energy in the fossil fuel industry, and reducing the energy used by the fossil fuel industry. It was remarkable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495409">We really need to honour Alberta for that because Alberta did that first. I find it really stunning in this place that every Conservative keeps standing up and ranting about the very measure that my Government of Alberta put in place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495410">A decade later, along came the government of Rachel Notley who put in place a very impressive climate action portfolio. She announced a new regime that includes the carbon competitiveness incentive regulations. Those have been in place since January of this year. They apply to facilities like the oil sands, cement plants, fertilizer producers that produce more than 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2003 or thereafter. The Notley government also imposed a cap on oil sands carbon emissions and it was great news for me because I volunteered for seven years to finally deal with the emissions from the coal-fired power sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495411"> Again, I am very proud of Alberta because it has moved forward. The federal government is still talking about it and the federal government acts as if it has done it, but in fact, it has done nothing to change the Harper era coal-fired power regulations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495412">All the Harper government did was to say that by 2050 the coal-fired power industry either has to shut down or deal with carbon emissions. That was the big push for carbon capture sequestration. Guess what? It is really expensive and with the big push for that, in the end, the industry did not want to pay for it and the public is not happy about subsidizing it. At the big international conferences there are people trying to sell this, but it just did not work in Alberta. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495413">The reason this industry was not shut down earlier in Alberta was that the government refused to look at the health impacts of that sector. I tried really hard to get the federal and provincial governments to speak to it. I eventually had to intervene on my own with a lifelong friend who is a family doctor and who had documented in the Lake Wabamun area, where most of the coal-fired power industry is, the higher rates of multiple sclerosis and other diseases related to neurological disease. As a result of his and my intervening, and our having brought in an American expert from the eastern coast, the government finally put in place the only mercury control regulations in this country for coal-fired power. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495414"> Bit by bit, the Government of Alberta was doing good work. Along came the Rachel Notley government and Dr. Joe Vipond, who is a Calgary physician. He started gathering information from the Canadian Medical Association to determine an absolutely huge number of serious illnesses and deaths related to coal-fired power in my province. As a result of that data and as a result of costing those injuries, health impacts, and deaths, a lot of the issues having to do with asthma, lung disease, and heart disease, the government decided that it would move forward the date for the shutdown of coal power in Alberta. Therefore, by 2030 the coal power industry will be gone in Alberta.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495415">Those are great measures by the Government of Alberta, which were initially started by Premier Stelmach, a Progressive Conservative. These regulations replace the specified gas emitters regulation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495416"> I want to share with members the voice of one of my neighbours, who is a remarkable man. He travels around the world and advises China and Bhutan; he goes everywhere. He is an environmental economist. Mark Anielski has reminded us that the health care costs associated with climate change are “in the order of $300 million per year, along with other impacts of pollution”, and it is what he dubs an “unfunded liability”. He estimates this overall liability is worth “about $13.7 billion if you value carbon at $50 a ton which is what Shell and other companies shadow price carbon at”. He added, “This is in the spirit of taxing the bads and not the goods” and “everyone requires a share of responsibility...paying for that liability. But the tax really is an incentive to change our behaviour to be more efficient.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495417">I heard my colleague from Calgary rant about what the gas tax will do to address and stop the floods and terrible fires that have blighted British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. That is not the point. The point is we need to reduce the burning of fossil fuels so that we do not have more catastrophic floods and fires. We have been fortunate in Canada because we are not seeing the brunt of it that the rest of the world is already seeing. We need to understand that putting in place a carbon tax is meant as a preventive measure, not an after-the-fact enforcement measure. It is meant to trigger a different behaviour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495418">The Alberta regime is forecasting $5.8 billion over a three-year period from the carbon levy on large industrial emitters. We need to also recognize that the regimes put in place in each province are going to be different. My province is blessed with, although some people say it is cursed with, major emitters. We have the major oil and gas sector. What that means is if we impose a tax, we are going to generate a lot of revenue. We also have been blessed with having a good number of people earning a good income that is higher than in a lot of places in the country. Therefore, we are going to garner a higher tax revenue. However, most of that tax will be from the purchase and burning of fossil fuels in our homes, in small businesses, and our vehicles. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495419">What will happen with that revenue? Unlike what British Columbia originally did, where it simply returned that tax money, I am glad that Alberta has taken a different direction. My understanding is that under the new B.C. government, it has also shifted over what it is doing with that revenue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495420">Two-thirds of that revenue is going to be reinvested in the Alberta economy: $1.3 billion in green infrastructure and $300 million in phasing out coal power. The government, in its wisdom, decided to buy out some of the coal industry because, foolishly, previous governments had allowed the coal power industry to expand at a moment in time when we should have known it was going to be phasing out. It has agreed to pay out some of those operations and the power purchase agreements. There will be $600 million going to energy efficiency for homes and businesses, and $1 billion will be going to support the coal communities that have housed the workers who have worked in the coal mines and the coal-fired power plants. That is a good initiative. It will also go into renewable energy investments, and innovation and technology.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5495421">I would add here that the Rachel Notley government has also put $50 million toward the retraining of workers in the coal-fired power and mining industries, and persuaded the federal government finally to extend EI. Where is the money from the federal government to match that? We hear a lot of talk, and there is yet another advisory committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495422">We hear pleas from members of the Conservative Party about what the carbon tax is going to do for them. What Canadians are looking for is what is being done to help communities and workers who feel they are suffering directly because of the shift to a clean energy economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495423">One-third is going to helping households, businesses, and communities directly. Some $500 million is going to small business tax cuts. Some $1.5 billion is going to low- and middle-income households. There is $1.5 billion in assistance for indigenous communities. It would be nice if the federal government would match that. The effect will be that the average natural gas bill is to rise by approximately $5 a month, and that is before the 2018 rebates. The majority of the gas bill costs remain in delivery, administration, and fixed costs because of the Ralph Klein deregulated system, which the Notley government is also trying to deal with. Two-thirds of Albertans are to receive a rebate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495424">The projected costs are actually posted on the Alberta website. Any members in this place who are concerned about their constituents can go to the Alberta government website and find out what the carbon tax will be. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495425">As long as Alberta's carbon tax remains in place, we in Alberta will not be subject to the federal tax regime. The government has been very clear on that. Of course, all provinces and territories have the option to implement their own choice of cost regime: cap and trade, carbon tax, or anything else that they can invent. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495426">However, a tax alone will not cut it. Broader federal action is needed if we are to deliver on our Paris commitments. Who said that? Many, including the federal commissioner of the environment and sustainable development, who continues to raise concerns that we are failing to deliver on our commitments in meeting our greenhouse gas reduction targets. Deeper actions are needed, including on climate adaptation. That was in a very recent report by the commissioner. Of course, the government thanked the commissioner for the report, but where is the action? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495427">I have great admiration for the Pembina Institute. The institute and others have said that the political will still appears to be high in the Liberal government. At least they voice support for it, but so is the greenhouse gas inventory high, and it is rising. The government cannot keep adjusting the timelines forward. Now it is saying it cannot possibly meet the 2020 target, so let us try for the 2030 target. The commissioner has spoken out loudly against that. She said that the government has to stop just moving the targets forward and it has to start taking action. Of course, we are already not going to meet the 2020 Copenhagen accord target. Apparently, we are also slated to fail to deliver on our Paris commitments for 2030. That is less than 15 years away. That means we have to be taking a lot of action right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495428">Close to 50% of emissions come from two sectors: oil and gas and transportation. We should also take care in the conversion from coal to gas. Burning fossil fuels will remain a health threat. There should be clear timelines for shifting to renewables. I am deeply concerned, and most Canadians are probably not aware that the standards the government is about to impose for a coal plant shifting to gas are not as strict as they are for building a new gas-fired plant. That is unforgivable. That is unforgivable for regions like mine in the Lake Wabamun-Genesee area that is almost the entirety of the supply of electricity in my province. Switching to gas is still going to provide a lot of pollution and we will have a lot of health impacts, and therefore a lot of costs to the public coffers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495429">The reductions in the building sector have also remained stagnant. We need to move forward on changes to the national building code so that new housing stock is energy efficient. All federal dollars for indigenous housing, schools, and facilities should require energy efficiency standards for sustainability and major cost savings to the communities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495430">We absolutely need the federal government to deliver the promised dollars to get isolated northern communities off diesel. We can look at the budgets over the last three years that the Liberals have put forward, and I have memorized page 149 and 150 of the 2017-18 budget. All I saw were zeroes for moving reliance of rural and remote communities off diesel: budget 2016-17, zero dollars; 2017-18, zero dollars; and 2018-19, nearly $40 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495431">We know how many first nations communities there are, and we know what the costs will be in some of those isolated communities, particularly in the high north. Come on, get with it. Let us move that spending forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495432">Supposedly the nation-to-nation relationship is the most important, and we recognize that those communities are struggling. We hear story after story of first nations that are fed up with waiting for government to help them, and they are moving forward themselves with groups like Iron &amp; Earth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495433">For example, Iron &amp; Earth is partnering with first nations in a community in the Maskwacis in Alberta teaching the local indigenous people how to install solar, and then installing solar. Why are we not doing that right across our country? I do not understand what the delay is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495434">We talked about skills development in the New Democrats opposition day. In the pan-Canadian program, supposedly for all the jurisdictions to work together to address climate change, what is missing? It is investment in skills development. Even when we put those questions to the government the other day, the answer back is always exactly the same: “Well, we're supporting clean technology”. However, who is going to work for the clean technology firms? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495435">There should be massive amounts of money flowing right now into every technical school in Canada. I sat down the other day in my constituency and started listing all the technical schools across this country that deliver renewable energy training. It is unbelievable. It is almost every community college. Certainly the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology in my city has a fantastic program, but it is oversubscribed. Young people are dying to learn these skills. Who is dying to learn it the most? It is our boilermakers, steelworkers, and electricians. They are begging to get into this field. They are saying that they may still work in the fossil fuel industry, but they want to transition over. There is no reason why, when there is a downturn in the oil and gas sector, they could not slide over and work in the renewable sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495436"> Kudos to Iron &amp; Earth, which started as a small group of men and women who worked in the oil sands. It has now spread right across the country. There is testimony after testimony. I encourage members to go to the Iron &amp; Earth website and look at the testimonials from men and women working in those sectors, and how badly they want to get into this sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495437">We heard all the promises from the Conservatives when they were in power. They were in power for 10 years, and they never issued those promised oil and gas regulations. So much for their actions on climate change. They never joined IRENA. Finally, three years later, kudos to the Liberals for finally discovering this international agency for renewable energy and joining it. However, I do not know what they can bring to it. I think they need to start investing and showing that we are actually taking action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495438">I will close with my former colleague, Paul Dewar, who is kick-starting an initiative next week for youth. I have been working closely with a fabulous group called the 3% Project. Two young people have travelled right across the country visiting just about every high school and every university, including in this city. Their objective of 3% is to reach one million young people in Canada. They want them to learn about the need for action on climate change and sustainability, and to take on a project. It is absolutely inspiring. I encourage everyone to look into 3% Project. That is our future, and I know that they believe we should take action and will not listen to the naysaying from this motion, which we will clearly vote against.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495456"> He said: Mr. Speaker, tonight, I am pleased to speak about the 2018-19 main estimates, which I tabled on April 16. The main estimates provide information to support the government's request that Parliament approve $276 billion in spending to deliver programs and services in the fiscal year starting April 1, 2018. This includes $113 billion in planned voted expenditures, and $163 billion in statutory expenditures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495457">The main estimates support two appropriation bills, the first <Document DbId="9725477" Type="3">Appropriation Act No. 1, 2018-19</Document>, approved $31 billion in interim funding for voted expenditure requirements in the first three months of the fiscal year. The second <Document DbId="9980158" Type="3">Appropriation Act No. 2, 2018-19</Document> will approve the remaining $82 billion. Through these main estimates, the government continues to make important investments in the priorities of Canadians: growth, progress, reconciliation, and advancement as part of our plan to grow and strengthen Canada's middle class.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="5495458">We are also delivering on our commitments in a manner that is open, transparent, and accountable to Parliament.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495459">Canadians and the parliamentarians representing them have the right to know how public funds are being spent, and to hold government to account.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="5495460">That is why we made changes to the estimates process to make it easier for Canadians and parliamentarians to track expenditures. For the first time in recent history, the main estimates will include all budget measures announced in this year's budget.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="5495461">This is a major step forward, and it has been made possible in part by changing the tabling date of the main estimates to mid-April, after the budget. In the past, new initiatives announced in the budget did not appear in the main estimates because the main estimates were tabled before the budget. Parliamentarians were left largely in the dark about how spending announced in the budget would be allocated to departments. <I>The Globe and Mail</I> rightly called the system bad to the point of absurdity, with spending estimates usually coming before the budget and in a different accounting format, rendering them virtually meaningless. As the <I>Globe</I> put it, “It's a discredited practice that has only served to keep MPs in the dark about how tax dollars are being spent.” That is why our government has taken steps to address these problems and strengthen transparency to Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495462">We have revised the Standing Orders so that the main estimates are much more likely to be tabled after the budget. To do this, we have added the new budget implementation vote to the main estimates. Changing the sequencing allows the 2018-19 main estimates to include all the measures announced in the budget for this year. Therefore, today, parliamentarians have a document in front of them that is relevant and complete so they are better able to hold government to account for how it spends tax dollars. By law, this money can only be spent on the measures announced in the budget tabled on February 27, 2018. Treasury Board, as a central agency, does not have any discretion to use the funds for any other purpose. Parliamentarians can now trace each and every allocation from this new central vote to a specific line in the budget. That is table A2.11 in the budget, and in the main estimates in annex 1. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495463">Allow me to address some of the concerns that have been raised recently about the budget implementation vote. Let us take the assertion that the budget implementation vote does not allow sufficient oversight by parliamentarians. As someone who has served in this House for over 21 years, I respectfully disagree. In fact, parliamentarians still have the opportunity to study and vote on the budget and the estimates and the appropriation bills for the main and supplementary estimates. In both the budget plan and the main estimates, they have a detailed disclosure of the measures to be funded from the central vote. Former parliamentary budget officer, Kevin Page, recently called the detailed table in the 2018 budget, “a 'clear signal' that the federal government wants and is working to give a more accurate figure of the year's upcoming spending”.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495517">One of the most important principles we have as elected members of Parliament is what we call the responsibility of government.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="5495518">This means that when a government tables a budget or potential expenditure, it will be analyzed by the elected representatives of the people. This is one of the founding principles, a pillar of our system, and we must maintain and support it. We certainly must not ignore it, which is why we are here today talking about the latest main estimates tabled by the <Affiliation DbId="214341" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation> for the upcoming year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495519">There is one thing in particular in these main estimates that members of the official opposition and members of the second opposition group are worried about, namely the infamous vote 40.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495520">This vote would give the government access to a $7.4-billion envelope to spend according to its priorities, and it would not have to report on this envelope until the fall of 2019. I remind members that there will be an election in the fall of 2019. The government is essentially getting a blank cheque so big that it is almost grotesque, but that is the truth. The government is getting $7.4 billion, and it can do whatever it wants with it. Life is good, and we will talk about it after the election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495521">This is not how things work in our democratic system. It is important and imperative that every dollar spent be subject to scrutiny.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495522">If by some misfortune this vote is approved and we accept this situation, that is more than $7 billion that will be sheltered from the scrutiny that we are all subject to in accordance with our mandate. The sad thing is that the programs are vague and it is even written that way in the legislation. The money can be associated with departments or agencies, but the legislation does not specify where the money will go, how it will be spent, and what their objectives are. It is worrisome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495523">There are also no progress reports. Usually we would get a report every three to four months. That makes sense because it allows us to know how far we have come, are we on course? Are we following the curve? Is the spending in line with what was projected or are we spending too much? It is important to have an update every three or four months, depending on the expenses. In this case, reports are not required. That is another concern.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495524">There is also no legal controls around the use of this fund, which should be a top priority. It is very important. When we vote on budgets, on envelopes, we have some idea of what is in store. Sometimes there are some contingencies, which is totally legitimate, but we know where we can spend and where we cannot. That is what we call legal controls. None exist in the case of vote 40. We believe that is a concern that absolutely must be addressed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495525">The same goes for the budget. There are things in this budget that are vague and lack legal restraints. Everything is left to the goodwill of the government. It can spend as it sees fit with the margin of manoeuvre that it gave itself.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="00">(1800)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5495526">I am sure that, later on, my colleagues across the way will very keenly claim that I do not know my history and that I should know that my own government, meaning the previous government, did the same thing with a $3-billion budget. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495527">Given that Canada and the entire world were in the midst of the worst economic crisis since the great recession, it was perfectly normal for the government to give itself three billion dollars' worth of latitude. I would point out that that is less than half of the amount currently at issue, and back then, the economic climate called for swift, immediate action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495528">Everyone knows that the situation is reversed today, because the economy is booming around the world, not just in Canada. That means our economy is flourishing and jobs are being created, all thanks to the global economic boom. We need to keep that in mind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495529">Naturally, as soon as the subject of public finances or budgets comes up, since that is what we are talking about, I feel impelled to remind the members that the government betrayed the trust Canadians had placed in it. Almost three years ago now, these people got elected on the promise of small deficits and a zero deficit in 2019. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495530">How is that actually playing out? The deficit is three times higher than promised, and we have no idea when the budget will be balanced. Then the Liberals have the gall to ask us to trust them when they say the $7.4 billion will be put to good use. We want to believe them, we know they are not dishonest folks, but the problem is that they said one thing to get elected and are now doing the opposite. The problem is that voters believed they could trust them. Unfortunately, they were wrong. The Liberals have not kept their promises. They have scrapped the agenda they campaigned on. Day after day, they talked about how they were bold enough, courageous enough, but also responsible enough to say that deficits were necessary to stimulate the economy and that everything would be fine. Great. Wonderful. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495531">Today we see the truth of it. The Liberals have run up massive deficits and have no idea when they will balance the budget. That flies in the face of every single recognized, rigorous economic theory. Just because a country is enjoying a period of prosperity does not mean it should go into debt. We all know about economic cycles. Sooner or later, when prosperity is flagging, the government will have to pay for today's spending with money it does not have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495532">The government likes to crow about its lofty principles, saying how fantastic it is that it has lifted thousands of children out of poverty with more generous benefits than the previous government offered. It is so easy to hand out money one does not have and, I would add, so low to claim to be doing it for the children, when they are the ones who are going to pay for it later. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495533">A deficit is a debt. When is a debt paid? Later. A debt is a bill that our children and grandchildren will be forced to pay because today's Liberal government does not know how to manage money responsibly.

They were in different years. It was confusing to see what we were budgeting and what we were actually spending and how we compared the two. Now when we go on Canada.ca, it is all in the same period. We can see last year's expenditures, this year's estimates voted on, next year's estimates, and estimates to date. Therefore, we now have full transparency between budgets and estimates, bringing them into the same period. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495552">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to speak this evening to the main estimates, and of course, the important vote tonight. I think this is one of the most important debates we have in this House. We are talking about spending a lot of Canadians' hard-earned tax dollars. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495553">There are many good things the federal government can do for Canadians, but we need to be very particular about how we authorize and how we look at the government's plans for spending money, because every penny has come from citizens who work hard. When they give money to the government, it means that it is perhaps a hockey lesson their child cannot do. It is something they are foregoing with that money going to the government. I think as we have this debate tonight, that should be very clear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495554">Perhaps, by the end of the points I make, anyone who might be watching this debate is going to realize that the government is betraying its commitment to transparency and accountability. I am going to give a few examples of how that has happened. They have taken what was an imperfect system and made it a whole lot worse than it was.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495555">First of all, I want to talk a little bit about the normal process at committee and how the government has degraded that normal process that used to happen, and then I will talk about the infamous vote 40.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495556">It used to be that for the main estimates, the minister would come to committee. We would usually have an hour with the minister and an hour with the officials to talk to them about their spending and their spending plans. I am going to use the indigenous affairs portfolio as an example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495557">Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada, as members know, has been split into two parts. What happened this year was that the government decided it would have one minister for one hour and the other minister for the other hour. It was quite interesting. We would have liked to have that televised, because it was important. We heard that there were ministers at many committees. There were four committees that had ministers for a two-hour session on that particular day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495558"> What happened was that there were votes, so in our first hour, we actually had 30 minutes of time to talk to the minister and her departmental officials, and then there was another vote, and we only had 30 minutes for the second minister. What that meant, in reality, was that once the minister had given her 10-minute presentation, the official opposition had a grand total of seven minutes to question the minister on her spending plans. We had seven minutes for the <Affiliation DbId="233806" Type="4">Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations</Affiliation> and seven minutes for the <Affiliation DbId="233807" Type="4">Minister of Indigenous Services</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495559">What does that mean? We had seven minutes to talk to the minister about Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada, which has not been separated yet. We had seven minutes to talk about $3 billion for the <Affiliation DbId="233806" Type="4">Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations</Affiliation>, and seven minutes to talk to the <Affiliation DbId="233807" Type="4">Minister of Indigenous Services</Affiliation> about $9.3 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495560">How can the official opposition do an effective job when the government does not even have the courtesy of looking at what is happening and planning its votes and its need for adjournment and stopping debate? The Liberals plan them for times when they know that committees are meeting and ministers are there. They are eroding accountability. That is a significant concern, because to be quite frank, seven minutes is absolutely nothing for spending of almost $10 billion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495561">Of course, that does not include talking about the $1 billon that is in this very elusive vote 40. The <Affiliation DbId="214341" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation> has stated that he is going to align the budget so that we have more information. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495562">Let me tell colleagues what people have said about vote 40. We had seven minutes to talk about $9 billion. We had seven minutes to ask questions of the minister about $3 billion, and we really do not know what is happening with that $1 billion. The member is trying to proclaim that this is better for Parliament and good news to know that we are going to authorize spending.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495565">We have already talked about having a challenge in terms of proper oversight, and now we have a new system that further erodes that. I would like to give credit to the member for <Affiliation DbId="214129" Type="2">Elmwood—Transcona</Affiliation>. He said, “something irregular and abnormal [is] happening here in terms of the way the government is asking to approve spending”. That is pretty significant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495566">I will go back to the former parliamentary budget officer, because the Liberals certainly liked him in the past. In the last Parliament, they talked about the important work he did.</ParaText>

In the time I have been in Parliament, I have never seen that from the representatives of the government on a committee. The Liberal members on that committee walked out. They did not come back to committee, and then, of course, the estimates were deemed considered. If this is the government's commitment to transparency, accountability, and dialogue, it is really quite shameful.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495589">Mr. Speaker, what we will be voting against is the creation of a process that has allowed for such limited scrutiny. The Liberals will be asking us to vote for a slush fund that is worth over $7 billion tonight. How can we, as parliamentarians, and the backbenchers as well, vote in good conscience for something that we know there are no proper checks and balances around? I would suggest that maybe some of the Liberal backbenchers should look at these issues and perhaps think very carefully about what they are voting for.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495590">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to finally rise to address the issue of these main estimates. This debate on the main estimates is very different than we have in the past because there is a new mechanism for how the government is seeking to appropriate all of the money that it says it requires for its new budget initiatives. As members in this place will know, I have tried, in a number of ways, to have a debate in the House on this, so I very pleased that we are finally getting an opportunity, if only briefly, to discuss this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495591">I made a request of the <Affiliation DbId="214341" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation> to have a take-note debate on this, I made a request of you, Mr. Speaker, that we have an emergency debate on this, I raised it in a number of different ways at committee, and, yes, I have been frustrated. There was some allusion made already to what debate at committee looked like. There was one meeting where the committee adjourned with 40 minutes left on the clock in our scheduled time because government members saw fit to adjourn the committee rather than stick around to do our duty and study the main estimates. On another occasion, Liberals left the meeting en masse so there was no quorum and the meeting collapsed. The chair made arrangements for us to go back and continue the study of the estimates, but when the time came to resume that study, all six Liberal members did not show up and the meeting could not continue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495592">Although the estimates on Treasury Board have been reported back to the House, it is important to note that they were deemed reported back and not, in fact, approved by the committee. While I know that from a procedural point of view that makes no difference in the House, from a moral point of view, it makes an important difference, because the fact of the matter is that the new mechanism was not approved by the committee but simply deemed approved. Therefore, it is important that we now address that issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495593">I will direct some of my remarks directly to what the <Affiliation DbId="214341" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation> said tonight in this debate. He talked about the fact that the estimates process has not been a perfect process. I do not think any members here would disagree. We know that it was dysfunctional to have estimates tabled only days after the budget was presented in the House and to not have any new budget initiatives reflected in the estimates. That is why New Democrats, as a party, were quite open to the idea that we would delay the tabling of the main estimates on a trial basis in order to give the government more time to do its due diligence and move new budget initiatives through the Treasury Board process so that the rigorous costing was done, so that the program planning was done, and so that government would be able to answer questions about how it proposes to spend the money allocated for new budget initiatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495594">In fact, that is not what happened. Instead, the government decided to create a new central vote, heretofore unprecedented, and dump all of the proposed spending into the one vote. That had a number of important consequences for the study of the estimates. For one, it kind of broke the committee study process, because instead of having those new budget initiatives that under the old system would have, in time, gone to the subject expert committees, all of those things went to one committee, the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates, which is not an expert on the environment, health, or defence, and yet it was being asked to evaluate the new spending proposals in the government's budget. Therefore, that was not particularly good from a study point of view.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495595">It also undermined the process because we were being referred to a document, namely, the budget, which is outside the usual estimates process, in order to get information about that spending. However, the budget document is, by its nature, vague and the vagueness of the budget may be frustrating from time to time, but it is not inappropriate. It is a policy document in which the government lays out its high-level goals and throws some figures in. They are not the real figures or the end figures, those come in the estimates, but that is why there are two different processes. The government has been kind of conflating those processes and, in the end, diluting the importance and accuracy of the estimates. Therefore, there was a problem in the way these estimates were going to be studied, but also in terms of referring us to less detailed documents.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="25">(1825)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5495596">We saw, time and time again, with department officials who came to committee, that they do not have a plan. We even saw some of them were just genuinely confused. They did not understand how this new system worked and how it was they were supposed to be getting money that was not reflected in their main departmental estimates. That confusion was apparent at committee when the Liberals, as a kind of Hail Mary pass, decided to have an omnibus study meeting on the last day before the estimates would be deemed back to the House, where they invited officials from a dozen different departments to present within an hour or so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495597">Earlier, an honourable member talked about how frustrating it is to only get seven minutes with a minister on the entire department. Well, imagine getting 14 minutes with 12 departments. Do the math on that and it is about a minute per department for all of the new budget spending. That is only because not all the departments were even represented. I do not think that meeting met the threshold of rigorous scrutiny that people would expect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495598">There have been a number of procedural problems because this vote does not fit our normal processes, and so parliamentarians have been trying to work that out as best they can at committee. Of course, the real solution would be not to have a vote like this at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495599">I started by saying that we were in a position where there was a problem with the process. We were open to the idea of allowing a later tabling of the estimates so the government could do the rigorous costing and get it through Treasury Board so officials could actually answer questions about what the proposed spending was. Instead, what we were given was a mechanism where there is a nice table that aligns with what is in the budget, but we cannot actually do our work as parliamentarians to hold the government to account and see if it has a decent plan for how it is going to spend that money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495600">This is where I want to get to some of the remarks of the <Affiliation DbId="214341" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation>, because I think that by an intellectual sleight of hand he is missing the point. The point was never just to have the kind of soft budgeting numbers from the budget document reflected in the estimates. The idea was that we would get the harder, more rigorous numbers developed through the Treasury Board process in the estimates for the new budget initiative so parliamentarians could actually do their due diligence in the main estimates that represented the budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495601">Instead, we have been asked to trade off information that aligns better between the two documents against our actual powers of oversight and accountability with government. That is not just my analysis, that is what the Parliamentary Budget Officer said with respect to the budget implementation vote as well. It was very clear there was a trade-off here, and on the other side of that trade-off was a sacrifice of parliamentary accountability. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495602">What we have heard consistently from the minister and his officials at committee is that somehow parliamentarians are supposed to be satisfied that they can hold the government to account and perform their oversight function if they get the information after the money is spent. They somehow think accountability works by giving a blanket approval to, in this case, over $7 billion worth of funding, and then getting a note posted online after about how the government spent the money. If that money is not well spent, the fact is there is no way to take it back. Canadians do not get that money back. That is why they send us here to do our due diligence and make sure the government has a realistic plan before authority is given for that spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495603">That is the important principle being undermined here, and one that has not been addressed in the arguments of the <Affiliation DbId="214341" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation>. I wish he would explain how it is he thinks that is an acceptable model. That was the basis of the question I posed to him earlier this evening that he did not answer. I do not see how he could accept this notion of retroactive accountability as the basis for the Treasury Board's own work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495604">The Treasury Board has an important accountability function within government. Its job is to challenge departments and make sure that their business plan, or whatever we want to call it, or their strategic plan for new government initiatives make sense, that they have done their due diligence, have done appropriate costing, and have considered different ways of running a program. I find it very hard to believe that the <Affiliation DbId="214341" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation> would find it acceptable if departments came to the Treasury Board and said that instead of having it ask them all these obnoxious questions, because they are not really sure what they are going to do yet, to stop badgering them if they agree with the goals about how they are going to get it done.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="30">(1830)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5495605">Suppose department officials could say they were going to go away and figure it out, and that the <Affiliation DbId="214341" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation> did not have to tell them how to do it, because they knew how to do their job. When they were finished and had signed the contracts and paid the money, then they would post online what they did, and the officials at Treasury Board could look it up. If they did not like it they could call the departments and talk about it, and that would be Treasury Board holding them to account. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495606">It is laughable. I certainly hope Treasury Board would not accept that model for itself. The idea that Treasury Board officials think that parliamentarians should accept that notion of accountability for Parliament and that Parliament should understand its accountability function for government in that way is an insult to this place. It makes perfect sense that parliamentarians would be able to ask questions of government departments in terms of what they are going to do with money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495607">As an example, in these estimates there is approximately $54 million under Treasury Board vote 40, or the budget implementation vote, for the Canada Border Services Agency, to strengthen the border and to help the CBSA. There are a lot of ways. We have had debates in this House about the border. Different people have different ideas about what ought to be done on the border. They cannot tell me it does not matter to parliamentarians whether the government ultimately uses that money to hire more CBSA staff, to buy guns, or to build a wall. Those are three ways to strengthen the border on some interpretations. Obviously, some are better than others. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495608">The idea that it would not matter to parliamentarians which of those three roads the government was planning to take is ridiculous. However, we have heard from Treasury Board officials at committee that it is not the business of parliamentarians to plan programs and to wonder how the money exactly is going to be spent, that parliamentarians should be satisfied with high-level—read “vacuous”—goal statements like “Strengthening the Canada Border Services Agency”. We cannot approve money on that basis alone and Parliament has already recognized that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495609">That is why we have had a rigorous process, not a perfect process by any means but a process that at least in principle allowed parliamentarians to interrogate ministers about the plans for the departments and particular line items in the budget to know how they were planning to spend that money. That is not some cute principle. It is essential in order for parliamentarians to be able to do their jobs. I have found it astonishing that the Treasury Board, who recognizes that in its own work, and ought to, does not see that Parliament requires information as well, in order to be able to be said to be an accountable body. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495610">There is a need for accountability. That is something certainly that the Liberals recognized in the last campaign.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495611">Let us take a recent example of the Phoenix pay system where the Auditor General has called it an “incomprehensible failure”, because at various stages in the process people were not asking the right questions, or they were accepting answers that needed to be challenged and those answers were not being challenged. The fact of the matter is that for an organization as large as the Government of Canada, if it is going to have proper accountability for spending, it needs to have multiple accountability mechanisms. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495612">Parliament is one of the most important and fundamental of those mechanisms. Therefore, it is wrong for us to be undermining the power of Parliament to provide effective oversight for government spending. I am not saying that the estimates process alone would have stopped Phoenix. Obviously money for Phoenix was appropriated under the estimates process. However, it is one of those important checks and balances, and if we allow each of those checks and balances to be undermined because no one check and balance is the be-all and end-all, eventually we are going to find ourselves in a situation where we do not have an appropriate number of checks and balances. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495613">As I say, Parliament is one of the most important because it is the accountability process that gives the political and moral legitimacy for government to pursue certain measures. It is not a simple control. It is actually one of the most important controls because it is the one that confers legitimacy to government programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495614">That is, in essence, the real problem with Treasury Board vote 40, or the budget implementation vote. It does not allow Parliament to do its job.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5495615"> Getting more information is good. I do not think anybody here is opposed to the idea of having more information, or having the information presented in a more digestible way, where it is more obvious how what was announced in the budget lines up with what is being asked for in the estimates. The <Affiliation DbId="214341" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation> is trying to defeat a straw man here, because nobody is saying that it is not better to have that information. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495616">That information should not come at the cost of meaningful oversight, and it does not have to. That is what we heard from the Parliamentary Budget Officer. Frankly, it is what we heard from the <Affiliation DbId="214341" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation> when he referred to the Australian model as the gold standard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495617">Australia does not have a huge omnibus central vote for all of the new budget initiatives. Australia has a Department of Finance and a treasury board secretariat that co-operate in advance of the budget being released. They communicate to the departments which initiatives on their departmental wish lists are going to get into the budget. Then they work with those departments to do the rigorous costing process and to run those programs through treasury board before the budget is announced. That allows them to table their main estimates at the same time as the budget without asking Parliament to sacrifice its power of oversight, without telling parliamentarians that they cannot answer questions about how to spend the money because they have not figured it out yet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495618">It is important to note that the model that the <Affiliation DbId="214341" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation> is invoking as a justification for what he is doing does not support the idea of a central budget vote. It is something very different. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495619">It is lamentable that the <Affiliation DbId="214341" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation> did not get buy-in from his colleagues in government in order to be able to accomplish that feat. I recognize that cultural change within an organization is not easy but it is incumbent upon the minister to get that job done within government. For him to impose a lack of accountability on Parliament and to undermine the work of parliamentarians in terms of holding the government to account with respect to the government's financial plan is wrong. It is not the place of the executive to undermine the authority of this place with respect to financial matters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495620">That is a major problem. I cannot stress enough the frustration that I feel when we listen to members on that side talking about how we have to suffer this red herring about coordinating the two documents. There were lots of ways that the budget and the estimates could have been better coordinated in terms of the information and cross-referencing of that information without asking parliamentarians not to do their job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495621">Another issue that deserves to be addressed is the idea of online reporting. I am not opposed to it but I do have a problem with its being a substitute for parliamentarians receiving information in the proper way in this place and having that information tabled in this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495622">We all know, without accusing the government of the day of doing anything like this, that some governments are more unscrupulous than others and online information can be changed. When we get official documents in this place they are in a form that is not alterable. If it is published and tabled in the House of Commons, it exists in a particular form and it is public. While a website is public, the information on it can be changed and changed in a way that does not record the fact that it has been changed. It can appear one way one day, and another way on another day. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495623">That is why there is a certain permanency to the documents that are here and that is important. It is a reason why parliamentarians should not be quick to accept promises of online publication as a substitute for documents duly tabled here in the House of Commons.</ParaText>

One of the jobs of parliamentarians is to hold the government to account and it does not come as a surprise to me, and I say this without any disrespect to their careers or talent, that people who came up through government would be very trusting of government to look over its own shoulder and police itself. That is not our job in this place and I humbly submit to the member that if that is the job he wants, he is welcome to join the public service. However, in this place, it is our job to keep an eye on the government to make sure it lives up to what it says it is going to do, and we cannot do that if it does not tell us what it is planning to do with the money before we approve the funds. Finding out about it after does not work. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495628">Let us say I am renovating my house. My contractor tells me what it is going to cost for a new kitchen, and I say, okay, and give him the money.

I want to know what kind of flooring he is going to put in. I want to know what kinds of cabinets he is going to put in. I want to know whether it will have a dishwasher. Those are all things that I, as the customer, want to know and have a right to ask. I will not approve the cost for a kitchen renovation and find out it looks nothing like what I thought I was signing up for.

              <ParaText id="5495630">One of the main problems with this slush fund, which has been pointed out by the Parliamentary Budget Officer, is that not one penny of that $7.4 billion shows up in the departmental plans of the government, not one penny. I am going to read what the departmental plans are for. They describe departmental priorities, strategic outcomes, programs, expected results, and associated revenue.

It has reduced some, but added 35. The issue is that there is $100 million in this slush fund, but not one penny of it is shown in the departmental plan.

It undermined the study of the estimates process and was not in keeping with the procedure and practice of this place. I felt this was so serious that I raised a point of order to that effect. The Speaker ruled and I will not comment on his ruling. However, it is an important issue. Departmental plans are supposed to be the place we go to understand what government does in its spending and what it plans to do, and to hold it to account. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495634">Departmental plans are part 3 of the estimates. They are a formal document. They are meant to provide, in a contained document, both the funding requests and what government plans to do with the money. Now, by having this central vote, we have all this other information hanging out there that parliamentarians do not see as part of the ordinary process of studying the estimates. Hence we saw a lot of confusion. Things that should have been asked at other committees were not. They were at our committee, OGGO, instead. Then we had the kind of circus of a meeting with 12 to 14 different officials from many departments trying to talk to one committee about it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495635">Not having this information in the departmental plans, even in the short term, has created a lot of confusion about how to study this and come to an accurate judgment about whether the numbers in the estimates make sense. In the long term, it creates a problem as well by having that information housed outside of the normal departmental plans.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495648">The hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214254" Type="2">Edmonton West</Affiliation> argued that certain provisions of the supply bill are not properly aligned with the content of the main estimates transmitted to the House by Her Excellency on April 16, 2018. More specifically, he was concerned that the wording of vote 40 under Treasury Board Secretariat, the budget implementation vote, contains new elements not originally found in the main estimates. He felt that this was inappropriate, as this language had not been considered by the standing committee and will not be concurred in by the House when it votes on the estimates later today. By modifying the language found in the bill, he felt the government was inventing new authority and purposes other than what had been communicated to the House by Her Excellency when the Estimates were presented.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="5495649">The hon. parliamentary secretary noted that the Standing Orders require that the appropriation bill be based on the estimates. He noted that this language is similar to that found in Standing Order 83(4) regarding bills based on ways and means motions. In his mind, there was no doubt that the appropriation bill was based on the main estimates.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="5495650">The hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214129" Type="2">Elmwood—Transcona</Affiliation> argued that each item in the main estimates contains an amount and a destination, as described in the vote wording. Since the vote wording lays out the purpose of the spending and the conditions governing the spending, he argued that the government could only change it through the supplementary estimates or by new legislation. He did not feel the government had the prerogative to change the form of its request, especially after it had already been reviewed and approved by committee.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="5495651">Standing Order 81(21) provides as follows:</ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The adoption of any motion to concur in any estimate or estimates shall be an Order of the House to bring in a bill or bills based thereon.</QuotePara>

              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="5495653">This provision is particularly significant given the way the House considers supply. The main estimates lay out the government’s spending plans. They are first tabled and then studied by committees over a period of several weeks. They contain an annex with the proposed items to be included in the schedule to the appropriation act. The supply bill is, by rule, considered at all stages in a single sitting, generally without debate or possibility of amendment. Such a process only makes sense if the supply bill is closely aligned with the main estimates. Indeed, the practice of distributing the supply bill at the beginning of the final allotted day, rather than when the bill is read a first time, developed, in part, because it is based on the main estimates. Similarly, the practice of allowing a member of the official opposition to ask, during the committee of the whole proceedings, if the bill is in the usual form, is yet another opportunity to reassure the House that there are no unexpected surprises in the bill</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="5495654"> The essential question, then, is what is meant by the words “based thereon”. As the parliamentary secretary mentioned, similar phrasing is used in Standing Order 83(4) regarding bills based on ways and means motions. While the chief opposition whip argued that this is not an appropriate comparison, I note that in both cases a motion must first be concurred in before a bill based thereon can be introduced. In one case, it is a motion to concur in the estimates, while in the other, it is concurrence in the ways and means motion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495660">I believe that these precedents are instructive to the case before us today. The difference between the wording of vote 40 as found in the main estimates and that found in the appropriation bill, is the addition of the words, “…set out under that department or other organization’s name in that Annex, in an amount that does not exceed the amount set out opposite that initiative in that Annex.” The amount of the vote is the same. The purposes of the vote are the same. The additional wording imposes certain conditions to the funding. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495661"> While I agree with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214129" Type="2">Elmwood—Transcona</Affiliation> that the government does not have a wide-ranging prerogative to modify the terms and conditions of the proposed spending, in this case, I note that the new language appears to be consistent with the information provided elsewhere in the main estimates. For example, the description of vote 40 found at part II, page 261 of the main estimates indicates that it is for measures approved and identified in Table A2.11 of the budget, measures which are essentially reproduced in the annex of the main estimates for the present fiscal year. I have some difficulty concluding, then, that the bill is not based on the main estimates.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495662">Therefore, in the present circumstances, I am prepared to find that the bill is properly before the House. Of course, to echo the words of Speaker Jerome, it would be most desirable that the bill adhere as strictly as possible to the main estimates. Were the variation more significant, the Chair’s conclusion could very well be different. </ParaText>

I know we have a long evening ahead of us, but if members can bear with me for a few moments, I will bring forward my thoughts and some of my findings based on my experience and on my work in my riding. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495667">I am proud to stand today and talk about our government's plan to put people first and ensure equality and fairness for all Canadians. We know that providing Canadians with the opportunity to realize their full potential is not just the right thing to do; it is the smart thing to do for our economy. By investing to create these opportunities for all Canadians, in all their diversity, we are instilling confidence and reinforcing the foundation for a stronger middle class and a growing economy for the benefit of all. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495668">I would like to spend a few minutes outlining the key elements of that plan, which are included in the supply bill before us today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495669">It is about a stronger economy that benefits all Canadians. A confident, growing middle class is driving economic growth, creating new jobs and more opportunities to succeed. Our plan is working, because Canadians are working. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495670">Over the last two years, Canadians have worked hard to grow our economy, creating 60% more jobs than the previous Conservative government over the same time period and driving the unemployment rate down to a 40-year low. Middle-class Canadians are now feeling more optimistic about their future, whether their plan is to pay down debt, save for a first home, go back to school to train for a new job, or ease their way into retirement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495671">In my riding, the average age is fairly high. The issue of those in the middle class transitioning into their senior years is, of course, a very important one, which we find addressed in the bill as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495672"> The very first thing we did as a government was to raise taxes on the top 1% so that we could lower them for the middle class. Also, through the Canada child benefit, we increased support for nine out of 10 families, putting more money, tax-free, into the pockets of parents for them to spend on things they need. That means more money for books, skating lessons, or warm clothes for winter. These are important achievements for the middle class and the people working hard to join it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495673">We know there is still hard work ahead of us before we meet our full potential, and there are challenges that must be overcome. We also know that some of our greatest challenges present the greatest opportunities. In the 150-year existence of our country, we certainly know that to be true. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495674">On the international stage, we are members of the G7, and we punch way above our weight, whether it is the strength of our economy or the strength of the exports that we push around the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495675">By creating these opportunities, the government is taking action through budget 2018 to make sure that the benefits of a growing economy are felt by more and more people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495676"> We are creating opportunities that draw strength from our diversity to build a country where every Canadian has a real and fair chance to work, to contribute to our economy, and to succeed. That includes Canada's talented, ambitious, and hard-working women. That is why in budget 2018 we focused on issues such as promoting equal parenting for new families, with a proposed new El parental sharing benefit, and tackling the gender wage gap. In short, it is fundamental to a strong and growing middle class. By building on this understanding, the government, through budget 2018, takes us further than ever before toward a stronger Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495677">I would like to talk in detail about one of the things we have been working on for quite some time, first as a party in opposition and now in government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495678"> We know that Canadians are working hard to build a better life for themselves and their families. Low-income Canadians are sometimes working two or three jobs so that they can join the middle class and give their children and grandchildren a better chance at success. Like all Canadians, they deserve to have their hard work rewarded with greater opportunities and a fair chance at success.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="05">(1905)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5495679">That is why, in budget 2018, we introduced the new Canada workers benefit, a new tax benefit that would put more money into the pockets of low-income workers. The new Canada workers benefit builds on the former working income tax benefit, or WITB, to give even more people greater financial benefits from working. The government is also ensuring that, starting in 2019, every tax filer who could benefit from the new CWB will benefit, by proposing changes that would allow the Canada Revenue Agency to automatically determine eligibility for those who do not make a claim.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495680">We have also enhanced access to the Canada child benefit, which we have talked about quite a bit here simply because we are quite proud of what we have done over the last little while. It is a tax-free benefit, especially for those with young families. We fought a gruelling campaign over this issue. We came out on the successful side, promising to do just this, and we are delivering it after two years. Like the Canada workers benefit, the Canada child benefit, or CCB, is a cornerstone in our plan to strengthen the middle class. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495681">We recognize that indigenous communities, in particular remote and northern indigenous communities, face distinct barriers to accessing federal benefits such as the CCB. That is why, in budget 2018, we expanded efforts to reach out to indigenous communities and to conduct pilot outreach activities for urban indigenous communities as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495682"> I recall that in the last Parliament we sat in front of many stakeholders in the indigenous community and first nations. In Newfoundland and Labrador, I have the only reserve on the island, which is Conne River, or Miawpukek. I remember some of them talking about their concerns for their brothers and sisters who were in urban areas yet full members of their own reserve. They were deeply concerned about the fact that a lot of first nations people living in larger centres were not able to access some of the government funding and programs that were available. That became a priority for many of us, me included, not just about first nations, but all indigenous people in Newfoundland and Labrador, particularly in Labrador.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495683">These efforts would ensure that indigenous people are better able to access the full range of federal social benefits, including the Canada child benefit, putting money into the pockets of those who are unable to afford basic goods for young children. That is what we built our campaign around.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495684">In closing, these investments in budget 2018, included in the supply bill before us today, recognize that new opportunities and equality are at the heart of Canada's future economic success. Fairness demands equality, and the prosperity of all Canadians depends on it. Certainly in an area such as my own, where the unemployment rate is high, we seek out ways so that people can re-educate themselves. We seek out ways by which they can find other forms of income by retraining and other methods.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495685">For seniors, we want to provide a blanket security that provides them with a living and with services so they can continue to enjoy their moments as they slip into their senior years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495686">By promoting equality, our government will help create long-term prosperity for the middle class and those working hard to join it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495687">On the other issues we have talked about in the House, both in the past and now as we lead up to this prosperity of a burgeoning middle class and low unemployment rates, I would say that it is best for us not just to create the jobs by which these people would have income relief available to them in case of unexpected job loss, but also to create a just society they can live in. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495689">I recently returned from a trip regarding the OECD. Many countries were fascinated by the new horizons program, because it provides a social benefit to seniors that they have not seen before. Many countries get deeply concerned about financial well-being, and it is true that this is the cornerstone, but to build upon that for our seniors is very important. There are other programs associated with it, also for the middle class. That is why we are very proud of the Canada child benefit. </ParaText>

We had feedback from this process. Individuals who may not be scholars when it comes to numbers and accounting to begin with can make mistakes when punching in numbers on the phone, and they are not receiving anything in paper. It is just a matter of going through the process and reporting their income tax using a phone tree in order to continue their child benefits through the government. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495698">Mr. Speaker, I want to return to one of the general themes of tonight's debate, which has to do with the budget implementation vote and what that means for parliamentary accountability for government with respect to its spending. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495699">I offered up a hyperbolic example earlier today, imagining some of the different ways the government might say it is strengthening the Canada Border Services Agency with the $54 million that is in vote 40. I suggested that it would matter to parliamentarians whether the government was deciding to hire more officers to patrol the border, to buy guns, or to build a wall. It is reasonable for parliamentarians to ask that question. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495700">However, a slightly less hyperbolic example that gets at the same thing is that, in these estimates, the Privy Council Office has asked for about $750,000 to support a new federal leaders' election debate process. The consortium that has sometimes done the debates in the past has said that it usually costs about $250,000 to do the debates for an election, so it could do at least three elections worth of debates for $750,000. The government is projecting that it may spend $5 million next year, and we do not know if that money is for consultation, or to set up an office. We do not know what that money is for, and the PCO has said it does not know what it is for, either. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495701">Does the member think it is acceptable for parliamentarians to be approving funding when we have no idea how the government would decide to support the goals it has stated for the funds? </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5495705">Mr. Speaker, we have had a spirited debate in the House and in multiple committees on this year's main estimates. We have also had a spirited debate about the important reforms that our government has introduced as a two-year pilot to improve the transparency and accountability of government spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495706">Today, I would like to spend my time highlighting why we are pursuing these important reforms, and what we have achieved thus far.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495707">The main estimates are a fundamental document, outlining the government's spending plans for the fiscal year. This year's main estimates include $113 billion of voted expenditures and another $163 billion of statutory expenditures. These expenditures will ensure our government can continue to deliver on its commitment to Canadians to grow the middle class, protect the environment, and invest in Canadians' priorities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495708">Allow me to highlight some of those initiatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495709">The 2018-19 main estimates propose $2.2 billion for the Department of Health. Our government will continue to help Canadians lead healthier lives and strengthen our universal health care system to quickly adapt to new challenges. The $2.2 billion in the main estimates will help the department deal with the opioid crisis, provide cannabis use education, and renew the federal tobacco control strategy. Part of that funding will also make home care and mental health services more accessible to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495710">The main estimates also include $20.4 billion for the Department of National Defence. This funding will support the implementation of Canada's new defence policy, “Strong, Secure, Engaged”; action to prevent and address gender-based violence, harassment, and discrimination; the integration of GBA+ considerations in all of its operations; and major capital projects.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="5495711"> I mentioned that the main estimates are a fundamental document outlining the government's spending plans. Naturally, the other fundamental document that outlines the government's spending plans is the budget. The budget sets out the priorities on which the government commits to spending its resources. It is the best guide to what the government is planning to do over the coming year, which explains why budget day is always so important in this town.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="5495712">However, in years past, there was a major disconnect between these two fundamental documents. The budget was tabled after the main estimates, which meant that the main estimates provided a detailed breakdown of spending plans only superseded and in many ways rendered irrelevant by the budget. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495713">Imagine if a company put out a detailed statement of its plans for the year and then a few weeks later put out another statement laying out the new investments to be made that year, and the two statements had nothing to do with one another. Shareholders would cry foul. They would not accept that the company's detailed breakdown of spending plans for the year had literally nothing in it about the key new investments the company was going to make that same year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495714">Clearly, most organizations do not operate this way, but up until this year, that is exactly how the federal government operated. It is no surprise that <I>The Globe and Mail</I> called the system “bad to the point of absurdity” and “a discredited practice that has only served to keep MPs in the dark about how tax dollars are being spent.” As somebody who has been in Parliament for over 20 years—I am obviously not talking about me—and as somebody who has spent the majority of that time on the opposition benches, the <Affiliation DbId="214341" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation> understands very well the important role that parliamentarians play in holding government to account and he understood the frustration in being provided with a document in the main estimates that was incomplete, not reconciled to that year's budget, and essentially rendered obsolete when the budget was tabled. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495715">Parliamentary committees devote many meetings to studying the main estimates, as they should, so the government decided that they should be studying a document that is more complete, more relevant, and more up to date. That is one of the reasons we introduced provisional changes to the Standing Orders for this year and next year. These changes allow the budget to be tabled before the main estimates, which means that the two documents can have the appropriate connections to one another. It means that they can be reconciled with one another. It means that the parliamentary study of the main estimates is far more relevant to the current spending priorities of the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495716">Two former senior public servants at the Department of Finance, Scott Clark and Peter DeVries, who are well respected for their commitment to fiscal responsibility, have praise for the changes. They call the new system a more comprehensive reconciliation between the budget spending proposals and the estimates, and they said that parliamentarians are now provided with more information than in the past. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495717">We are proud of important improvements to transparency and accountability and it is important to remember that we have demonstrated our respect for Parliament by making these changes provisional. After a two-year pilot, Parliament will have an opportunity to decide whether it wants to continue with these changes. I certainly believe and hope that it will, since returning to a system that was called “bad to the point of absurdity” would be a clear step backward.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="5495718"> The alignment of the budget and main estimates is not the only important reform we introduced. We also put in place a pilot project for purpose-based votes that give parliamentarians even more precise control over the review and approval of government spending.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="25">(1925)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="5495719">The existing system is built around categories of spending, for example, operating expenditures, capital expenditures, and grants and contributions. Parliament approves a total amount for each department for each of these categories. However, Parliament's discretion is limited to category-level spending. It has been like this for years, but to provide greater control to Parliament, we have piloted a purpose-based vote system at Transport Canada. This means that parliamentary control extends beyond the category of spending and down to the level of what purpose the money will go toward. We think this is another step in the right direction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495720">I sit on the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates. It is continuing to study how to better improve transparency and accountability to Parliament and I know we will come back with a report in short form.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495721"> I am proud of what our government has done thus far and we will continue to do this in the future to improve the transparency and accountability of government spending.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495738">As the federal member of Parliament for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, I welcome this opportunity to inform Canadians about the estimates, and particularly vote 40. My speech is going to focus on the cover-up and how the carbon tax has given rise to the need for a $7-billion slush fund. Canadians want to know if the $7-billion slush fund is part of the carbon tax cover-up, so I will begin by summarizing the carbon tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495739">I am going to start with the carbon tax cover-up that had been going on for years in Ontario and what it has meant to everyday, average Canadians. I am pleased to confirm that once the taxpayers in the province of Ontario became aware of what is known as the “green hustle”, they not only removed Kathleen Wynne from office, the red rump that remains is not even recognized as an official party in the legislature.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495740">For the benefit of taxpayers listening to this debate and hearing the term “green hustle" for the first time, here is an explanation of the term. An example of the green hustle is when the Conservative shadow minister of finance, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214462" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>, asks the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> when the government will share with Canadians how much the proposed federal carbon tax of $50 a tonne would cost a median Canadian family and the finance minister is prevented from answering the question by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s principal adviser Gerald Butts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495741">Instead, the <Affiliation DbId="214310" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> assumes the role of finance minister and invokes the green hustle by claiming some unsubstantiated benefit to the environment, where none exists. In fact, the evidence shows that adopting carbon taxes in Canada raises global carbon emissions by offshoring economic activity from relatively environmentally friendly places like Canada to places with lax environmental laws.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495742">Data from the World Bank reveals that China and other developing countries produce far more carbon per dollar of economic output, at purchasing power parity, than do western nations. China shows no signs of decreasing its emissions any time soon. China is currently building hundreds of new coal-fired plants, which will ensure carbon dioxide emissions continue to rise for decades to come. Taken together, these facts mean that for every factory pushed out of Canada because of a carbon tax, global emissions will actually increase dramatically, and this will be the case for decades to come. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495743">As a Conservative, I recognize there are many things we can do to improve the environment. A made-in-Canada environmental policy by Canadians for Canadians would be an honest start for the government. Carbon taxes are wrong for the Canadian experience. We live in a cold country which, by its very nature, is energy intensive. Carbon taxes are not neutral. No money will be returned to taxpayers. Carbon taxes are not going to save the planet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495744">The same tactic of using the environment to cover up the greed was used in Ontario, a tactic that resulted in ratepayers of Ontario paying the highest price for electricity in North America, a tactic that resulted in the Liberal Party of Toronto being reduced to a red rump. Green is the new red.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495745">A failed policy led to energy poverty among seniors and others on fixed incomes who have been forced to choose between heating and eating during the coldest months. With the term “energy poverty” a new expression in Ontario, the Ontario Association of Food Banks put a photo of a light bulb on its 2016 hunger report. For Ontario's rural residents in places like Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, there was no environmental benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495746">Industrial-scale wind turbines were forced onto unwilling Ontario municipalities and never demonstrated a benefit in cutting carbon dioxide emissions. In fact, according to a journal in the renewables green hustle racket, the way wind power and the carbon tax cover-up were done in Ontario, by covering up the carbon tax on electricity and calling it a “global adjustment”, is now a textbook example, a black eye so to speak, on how not to do greed energy.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="35">(1935)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5495747">There is a direct connection between the failed greed energy policies, the carbon tax cover-up of the Toronto Liberal Party, and the federal Liberal Party in Ottawa. Gerald Butts, who is the most powerful unelected technocrat in Ottawa today, held the same as an unelected technocrat in Toronto. The greed energy act that was so thoroughly rejected by voters in Ontario was his creation. The failure of the greed energy act has been well documented. What has not been well reported is how rich it made a select group of Liberal Party insiders. They are people like the $6-million man, Hydro One CEO Mayo Schmidt; and people like Mike Crawley, the former president of the Liberal Party of Ontario, who received a contract for $66,000 a day for 20 years, $478 million, to put up industrial wind turbines. The Liberal Party of Ontario was continually shaking down energy companies for political contributions to keep the money flowing if they wanted to keep their FIT contracts that were making a few select people obscenely wealthy at the expense of Ontario residents struggling with their electricity bills. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495748">Because the wind blows when power is not needed, Ontario ratepayers have paid American border states billions of dollars to take the unusable electricity. The Liberal Party talks about threatening a trade war against our largest trading partner, yet Liberal policy was providing the energy to run American industries in the U.S. border states that compete with Canadian manufacturers. Some of these American industries had been in Ontario, but were forced to leave because of the greed energy act and the high electricity prices it created.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495749"> I use the past tense because the new premier of Ontario, Doug Ford, has promised to govern with respect for the taxpayer dollars, something that needs to happen in deficit-obsessed Ottawa and the reason we are debating vote 40 this evening.

Canadians want to know if the $7-billion slush fund is part of the carbon tax cover-up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495750">The motion from the official opposition earlier today was asking for a clear explanation of the costs of the Liberal Party's carbon policy, just like we want to know what the costs of the estimates are for. We know they have the numbers because our finance critic has seen the redacted pages and there will be costs and indirect costs that will escalate throughout the Canadian economy. For example, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> needs to understand that his failure to effectively manage trade relations with our largest trading partner and his clumsy attempt to respond to his failures by announcing a trade war can only end badly for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495751">In my riding of Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, tourism is a large employer. As Jeff Wilcox, general manager of Pride Marine Group in Eganville and Ottawa has made me aware, the decision by the Liberal government to target boats as the only recreational product listed for retaliatory tariff will result in millions of dollars in lost wages and taxes. It will have a negative effect on what has been an affordable outdoor activity for middle-class Canadians. Will the $7-billion slush fund help them? Jeff says a single-family house in Toronto has become an unaffordable luxury for middle-class Canadians; so too will being able to afford a boat to enjoy the Canadian outdoors become an unaffordable luxury, thanks to Liberal policy and their failure to secure the North American Free Trade Agreement, and that is just one tariff. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495752">On behalf of all Canadians, I ask, what is the carbon tax cover-up really costing Canadians? By using a carbon tax to rapidly escalate the price of fuel, tourism in my riding, which will be hit by the trade war, will be hit even harder. At $2 a litre for gasoline, the most recent target price from the Liberal government, American and Canadian tourists will be staying home. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495753">The carbon tax cover-up will affect workers' pensions. For too many Canadians, unfortunately, retirement income consists of only the old age security and CPP. The decision by the Liberal Party to push the CPP pension managers to buy into the carbon tax cover-up by purchasing, with workers' pension savings, industrial wind turbines that are being dumped by their foreign owners, jeopardizes the CPP. Already, 77% of Canadians believe the CPP will not be there for them when they are ready to retire.</ParaText>

Carbon dioxide makes up only 4% of earth's atmosphere. Of that 4%, 3.4% is attributed to anthropological activity.

Those plants and vegetation actually take carbon dioxide, the dreaded gas the Liberals are so afraid of, out of the air and produce food with it. However, with the extra taxes on fuel and the taxes on transporting their livestock from point A to point B, and all the other costs that are going to ensue because of the carbon tax, it is going to make life unaffordable for them. Their prices will have to be raised and it is going to make food more expensive. When food becomes more expensive, the people with the lowest incomes in society are the ones who suffer the most.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5495763">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join in tonight's debate on the main estimates. Most Canadians who follow parliamentary procedure understand that the main estimates are all about granting spending authority to the government. Therefore, for the next few minutes I want to talk a bit about spending, not so much in the context of the main estimates, but more in the context of the out-of-control spending that is being exhibited by the current government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495764">To get a fulsome view of what I mean, I want to go back a few years to 2015. During the 2015 election campaign, the Liberal Party at the time made many campaign promises, most of which of course it has broken. However, I want to focus in on only one of those broken promises, and that is the promise that the Liberals made that, if elected, they would run modest deficits of no more than $10 billion, and that they would be temporary. The Liberals also promised that these temporary $10-billion deficits would be eliminated by the end of their first term; in other words, they were saying that they would be back to balanced by 2019. That is not just a broken promise, that is a shattered promise, because we are nowhere near balancing the federal budget by next year. In fact, we have found from documents provided by the government's own finance department that even if there is no new spending, the earliest the government could see a balanced budget would be the year 2045. To put it another way, if a 16-year old young man or young woman today wanted to see a balanced budget in this country, he or she would be 44 years old by the time that happened. It is shameful what the government is doing to the finances of this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495765">We should not be surprised because, after all, excessive spending is in the Liberal DNA. We have seen this time and again over successive Liberal governments. In fact, the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s own father, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, when he was in power for 16 years, was considered the most profligate spender probably in parliamentary history. To prove my point, I would offer this observation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495766">In 1984, when former Prime Minister Trudeau finally left office, Canadians and the Canadian government were spending $1.03 for every dollar that it took in in revenue. We should think about that for just a moment. How can Canadians who try and run an efficient household balance their own budgets if they continuously borrow and go further into debt? It cannot be done. Eventually, the rope runs out, the borrowing has to end, and the debt has to be repaid. Unfortunately, the current government does not seem to recognize that, because it continues to borrow and rack up massive deficits and incur more debt. Referring back to former Prime Minister Trudeau, Canadians are still trying to pay off the debt that he incurred during his 16 years in office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495767">We have also seen that the apple does not fall far from the tree, because the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has taken the same Keynesian approach to fiscal management, or in his case mismanagement, that we have seen from his father. We have seen the current Prime Minister rack up deficit upon deficit with no idea how to balance his own budget or the budget of his government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495768">That attitude has actually prevailed upon the current <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>. I point out that only a few short weeks ago, the finance minister appeared himself before the finance committee. During that testimony, he was asked on multiple occasions by the Conservative finance critic, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214462" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>, when the federal budget would be balanced. On multiple occasions he was asked that very simple question, and the finance minister could not respond, and did not respond. The reason he could not and did not respond is quite simple. It is because the finance minister does not know when the budget will be balanced. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="50">(1950)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5495769">I think that is absolutely shameful, that the chief financial officer of our country does not even know when his own budget can be balanced or will be balanced. No Canadian taxpayer should have to put up with that ineptness. We see it time and time again by the government, in everything it does, in every public document it puts forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495770">It is not just this massive deficit that the government is racking up that is of concern. To exacerbate the problem of the runaway deficits, the government continues to raise taxes on Canadians. One of the other broken promises by the Liberal government during the 2015 campaign is that it would lower taxes for the middle class, but it has done just the opposite. In fact, a recent study published by the Fraser Institute indicates that over 80% of Canadians today are paying more taxes than they did in 2015. They are paying higher income taxes and payroll taxes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495771">Now, on top of all of that, the Liberal government wants to introduce a job-killing carbon tax. We heard earlier today, from several of my colleagues, the problems with this so-called revenue-neutral carbon tax. Let us be clear, there is nothing revenue-neutral about the proposed carbon tax, nothing even remotely close to it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495772">The simplest way to try to explain how a carbon tax is supposed to work, according to the Liberal government, is that for every dollar taxed Canadians, to disincentivize them from perhaps using oil or gas or any other non-renewable resource, the government would refund that money back to that individual. It is simply not true. If it was, if every time I was taxed $100, I knew I was getting $100 back, why would the government bother taxing me to begin with? It makes absolutely no sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495773">According to the government, its rationale is this, if we disincentivize all Canadians by raising prices on everything, on home heating, on gas, on oil, they will stop using those products, they will change their consumer habits, and they will stop using things that the government thinks are pollutants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495774">That does not work. All we need to do is take a look at what is happening today in British Columbia, where the gas prices for a litre of gas is on the north side of $1.60 a litre. Has that changed consumer habits? No. Why has it not? Quite simply, Canadians still need to get to work, soccer moms need to take their kids to the soccer pitch on Saturday morning, and $1.60 a litre does not stop them from doing it. All it does is it takes more money out of their pockets, and it makes them and all Canadians far worse off and far less affluent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495775">This is the record of the Liberal Party: higher deficits, higher taxes, and now a threat to impose a job-killing carbon tax. A year from now, in 2019, Canadians will be given a clear choice. Do they want to re-elect a government that has raised taxes, that has increased deficits and debt, and that has imposed a carbon tax, or do they want to elect a Conservative government that will lower taxes and balance budgets?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495776"> I can assure the House that I have the utmost respect for the intelligence of the Canadian taxpayer, and because of that I know, come 2019, we will be seeing a new Conservative majority government here in Ottawa.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495798">Canadians may not hear about the over 24 hours of voting on the estimates that will start tonight, but they will definitely feel the impact of our government's plan to put people first and ensure that equality and fairness is there for all Canadians. On this side of the House, we know that providing Canadians with the opportunity to realize their full potential is not just the right thing to do, it is the smart thing to do for our economy. By investing to create opportunities for women and men, in all their diversity, the government is instilling confidence and reinforcing the foundation for a stronger middle class and for growing the economy that benefits all of us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495799">I am a big believer in empowering women to change the way we do politics; to change the way we do business, STEM, and community building; and to change the way we do everything. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495800">I would like to spend a few minutes outlining the key elements of budget 2018's support for Canada's women and girls, which are included in the supply bill before us today. I would like to spend some time discussing the data behind budget 2018's focus on women and girls.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495801"> Even though Canadian women are among the best educated in the world, they are less likely to participate in the labour market than men and more likely to work part time. On average, women in Canada earn 69¢ for every dollar earned by men, on an annual basis. Canadian women are under-represented in positions of leadership, and businesses in Canada are overwhelmingly owned by men. The number of women in economically transformative STEM remains low. Women who graduate from STEM fields typically earn an average of $9,000 a year less than their male peers. The demands of unpaid work are too often preventing women from pursuing opportunities to reach their full potential. This is holding back half of all Canadians from reaching their full potential and the full potential of what our country is able to accomplish. It is holding our economy back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495802">RBC <I>Economic Research </I>estimates that adding more women to the workforce could boost the level of Canada's GDP by as much as 4%. McKinsey Global Institute estimates that by taking steps to advance equality for women, such as employing more women in technology and boosting women's participation in the workforce, Canada could add $150 billion to its economy by 2026. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495803">Empowering women and girls will help close the gender gap that holds back growth and increases poverty. Simply put, equality between Canadian women and men will lead to greater prosperity, not just for women and their families but for all Canadians. With equality of opportunity as a guiding principle, budget 2018 takes us further toward this stronger Canada than ever before. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495804">Let me give some examples, some of which, I might add, are included in the supply bill before us today. To support young families and gender equality in both the workplace and the home, our government is introducing a new employment insurance parental sharing benefit that will help support an equal distribution of home and work responsibilities. This will provide an additional five weeks of El parental benefits when both parents agree to share parental leave or an additional eight weeks for those who choose the extended parental benefit option. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495805">With budget 2018, we are looking at federal institutions and providing a leadership role in addressing the systemic undervaluation of women. That is because we know that equal pay for work of equal value is a human right. Through budget 2018, we are addressing the gender wage gap by announcing that we will introduce historic proactive pay equity legislation in the federally regulated sector, which would apply to about 1.2 million employed Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495806">We are also looking at how we can better support women entrepreneurs in starting and growing their businesses and taking them global. Our government is committed to helping women-owned businesses grow, find new customers, and hire more Canadians. To help make this a reality, the Business Development Bank of Canada and Export Development Canada are making $1.65 billion in new financing over three years available to women entrepreneurs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495807">Empowering women to build their businesses and create jobs just makes good economic sense. Here at home, it is also important that we continue to break down barriers to gender equality in education and in employment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495808">In my riding of Mississauga—Erin Mills, I have established the Women's Council, dynamic women tasked with empowering more women at the grassroots level. The breaking of barriers is key to reducing poverty and building an economy that works for everyone. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495809">Budget 2018 proposes to help women enter and succeed in the trades by creating a new apprenticeship incentive grant for women. The grant will encourage women to enter the trades and fill positions that offer high-quality, well-paying, middle-class jobs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495810">On this side of the House, we know that equality is at the heart of Canada's future economic success. Fairness demands equality, and prosperity and growth for all Canadians depends on it. Canadians work hard every day. They take care of their families, run businesses and public institutions, protect communities, and create the art that shapes our culture and reminds us of what it means to be Canadian. For all they do, all Canadian women and men deserve to be equal partners in society and equal participants in the economy. Through budget 2018 and the measures listed in the supply bill we are debating today, we want to help make this goal a reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495811">When women have equal opportunities to succeed, they can be powerful agents of change and economic growth, improving the quality of life for families and communities. I have seen that first-hand in my riding of Mississauga—Erin Mills through my Women's Council and through the many women who take part in the economy in business and in not-for-profit organizations. I have seen their contributions to our country and the way we function as a whole. I know that, through budget 2018, we will continue to empower more women to take ownership, take leadership, and own the country that is Canada.</ParaText>

They tell her she should not be spending time in the home, if that is her choice; she needs to be contributing to the economy. They tell her that it is not enough to leave the choice up to her in which way she will contribute to the economy; they will actually tell her the way. They go on in the budget to outline that women should be contributing through STEM, the skilled trades, technology, engineering, and these sorts of things. They are not only telling women that it is up to them to decide whether they should work part time or full time, but they are going so far as to tell women exactly the fields they should be entering. </ParaText>

It is embarrassing. The goodwill of the government, the words of the government, and the words of the speech, yes, of course, but it is two and a half years later. It was 42 years ago that the previous prime minister Trudeau said the government was going to implement pay equity. It was 42 years ago, and it still has not happened. There are zero dollars in this budget to implement pay equity. My colleague across the way can say until she is blue in the face how important it is. Why does her government not do it? The Liberals have a majority, they have the mandate, and they have the words, but they have no concomitant action. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495819">They say now they are putting in this great new parental leave benefit. Six in 10 workers in Canada do not qualify for employment insurance, so fix EI and do something with the power you have and fund it in the budget. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495826">Mr. Speaker, it is always an honour to rise in the House with the ability to speak to whatever the topic may be, but today's topic is particularly germane and pertinent to our role as members of Parliament. Our role here is manifold, but prime among our role as members of Parliament and representatives of our constituents, of Canadians is to oversee the expenditures of the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495827">This has been a key characteristic of the Westminster model since its inception. I do not have to give you, Mr. Speaker, this historical lesson, but others in the House may benefit from it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495828"> There is no role I take more seriously or spend more time on than reviewing the proposed expenditures of the government. Not only do I have the honour and privilege to speak tonight to this topic, I also have the honour to serve on the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates. Every member of that committee takes his or her role seriously, feels honoured to have it, and knows the important work we do for Canadians and for the budgetary process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495829">That is why this year I was absolutely thrilled to be part of a groundbreaking process, a game changing process, almost an earth-shattering process in which we had the estimates presented before the budget. Imagine something as bold as that in the Parliament of Canada. We have corrected the errors of the past.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495830">This is a process that needs to be developed. It is not the end of the line; it is the first step. Improvements need to be made, and we all agree with that. I find it very odd that we have the most open and transparent process of budgets and estimates since Confederation, and we are here, probably spending the most time voting on the process. I find it almost ironic, and it would be funny and humorous, that we are all here voting on these items instead of spending time in our ridings and with our loved ones. It is almost like we have to examine everything because how could this possibly be fair? How could this possibly be just? Because it is open and transparent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495831">The Parliamentary Budget Officer has agreed. We now know what money will be spent before it is spent. We do not get the dollar signs after the budget is approved. Each of dollar of the $7 billion has been itemized. At the government operations committee, 12 departments and their officials were asked about the the expenses. With respect, I asked more questions about the expenses than the members from the party opposite. They wanted to play games and somehow pretend that this was an affront to democracy, an affront to the role of parliamentarians. How could they possibly approve money when they did not know what every dollar would do? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495832">Every year each member of Parliament gets a budget for his or her office. We are not asked where every dollar goes. We get an amount of dollars for the year and next year account for what we have spent. Why is that okay for every member opposite, but not okay for the government at large? </ParaText>

Did he say he could not possibly hire any staff or pay any rent because the numbers were not itemized, that he would not take the money? No, he did not and he used every staff member to research every point of history to give his eloquent speeches. Every week he gives a speech. He is not doing the research himself. His staff members are being paid to do that. We do not know how much they are being paid until the year is done. Does he say he does not want their services anymore, or does not want to speak in the House anymore?</ParaText>

Consequently, the budget initiatives were not in the departmental plans until the following year.</ParaText>

I hope we can all agree to make Canadians aware of where their taxpayers are going. This is important not only for that process. I am sure my friends on either side of the aisle would agree that once Canadians know where their taxpayer dollars are going, they will share my conclusion that they are getting value for their dollars, and that this Canadian government serves all Canadians well. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495854">We need look no further. If people do not believe in climate change, they will always have trouble with any price on carbon. That is the fact, unfortunately.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495856">The member talked about $7 billion, which does not have any real purpose in the budget. I happened to sit in in the government operations committee, so I would have to disagree with him. Very serious questions were asked. We asked officials what it really meant if we voted for $7 billion now? The officials said we could ask questions about it later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495857"> That is not the way it is supposed to work in Parliament. We are asked to approve measures. We know what they are and we vote for or against them based on what is going to happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495858">The member's analogy with the members' office budgets proves he has not looked very closely at his own budget. Our budgets are itemized. We know what the dollars are are for. We know what we can spend them on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495859">I would ask the member to think again about this request in the budget for members of Parliament to give a blank cheque of $7 billion to Liberals and only ask about it later.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495860">Mr. Speaker, the member for <Affiliation DbId="213909" Type="2">Esquimalt—Saanich—Sooke</Affiliation> did stand in one day on our government operations committee. I used to think we had the best committee on the Hill, but the day he showed up, I realized it could be so much better. He was like a bright light on the committee, and it was awesome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495861">However, since that time, we have invited 12 departments to committee to ask questions. My friend from <Affiliation DbId="214254" Type="2">Edmonton West</Affiliation> moved a motion, and we agreed to it, that brought 12 departments in front of the committee to follow up on the request the member made earlier in the committee. It was an important part of the process, and I agree.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495862">My comment toward the member's office budget is that we get an envelope of dollars for each sort of section and group, and that is exactly what vote 40 does. It gives an envelope to the departments to spend the money. They have to account for it after it is spent. It has to come back to Parliament. Every month, they will be reporting to the House. It is not a blank cheque.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495863">First, my idea of blank cheque is one that does not have a number on it. This one clearly has a number. I do not see where the blank cheque analogy comes from. Every dime has to be accounted for. Departments have to report back to the House. The Treasury Board president, who is doing yeoman's service on this file, has said that they will report back every year. He has done enough that the PBO has agreed that this meets any test of accountability and transparency.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495866">Today, I have the privilege of talking about the main estimates. To some, this might sound rather boring; to others, they might not even know what the estimates are; and still to others, they know exactly what they are and get really excited about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495867">What exactly are the estimates? Essentially, it is a financial plan put out by the government. It shows its priorities for the next year. Specifically, it casts a vision, but the vision is cast in numbers, really big numbers, lots of spending. As the opposition, it is our responsibility to look through these numbers and decide whether the government's spending is actually in the best interest of Canadians. Then we come before this place and we are able to put forward arguments with regard to whether those numbers are in fact in the best interest of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495868">Why should Canadians care? Canadians should care because governments do not have their own money. Governments spend Canadians' money. It is called “taxes”. At the end of the day, when we are talking about the estimates, talking about spending, and looking at these massive numbers, we are talking about the money Canadians have worked really hard for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495869">The Liberal government is spending a lot of it, a ton of money. It is money it does not have, a good portion of it anyway, so it is fair to say that when it is spending this money it is actually driving us further into deficit as a country. Now, there are only two ways a country can make money. One, it can develop the natural resources it has at its disposal. For example, building a pipeline and getting a commodity to market would produce money. The other way that a country can produce money is by taxing people directly through income tax, a gasoline tax, or through other sorts of taxation, a carbon tax, perhaps. We will get to that in just a moment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495870">While a Conservative government believes in giving priority to the development of natural resources, expanding trade, and developing international relationships, the Liberal government has actually chosen to increase taxation and incur a giant deficit while not fostering relationships with other countries, not making sure our commodities are able to get to market, nor ensuring we are attracting investors to Canada. The problem with this way of governing is that it makes life incredibly expensive for everyday Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495871">This budget, and therefore the estimates, could have been great. It could have cast a really great forecast across the country, a really great vision for our country. We had a lot of potential going for us. When the Liberals came into power, they had a world economy thriving all around them. Interests rates were low. The Canadian dollar was down, which facilitated trade, and entrepreneurs were creating jobs and were invested in our country, at least they were until recently. Now they have decided to pick up and go because there is a carbon tax being implemented. Those things were positive and created potential for us as a country to do incredible things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495872">With that, a responsible government would take advantage of this economic stature and take the additional money it could generate during this time and put it aside for when the country falls upon hard economic times and it is needed. Instead, the government is choosing to spend an additional $18 billion it does not have, which means it is an $18-billion deficit. There is absolutely no requirement to do this; the government is just doing it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495873">I have looked through the estimates and the budget, and I have tried to find what is so great about this that the government needed the extra $18 billion. I just cannot find it. The government will try to tell us it needs it in part, a significant part it says, for infrastructure, because infrastructure helps build our economy, helps invest in our nation, and make it a viable place for further investment from other businessmen and women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495874">The problem with this is that when we look at the numbers in the estimates, what we see is that infrastructure spending has been cut by $2.1 billion here and $35 billion has been given to a foreign investment bank, namely China. We are investing in its infrastructure, but we are not investing in Canada's infrastructure. How will this help Canadians? It will not. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495875">Let us look at some other things. The government is creating a $7-billion slush fund without telling us where that money is going. There is no accountability and no transparency. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="30">(2030)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5495876">The government is also taking $4.5 billion and putting it toward a pipeline. It did not need to put it toward this pipeline. The pipeline was going to go forward based on private money. However, the government ragged the puck. It put incredible regulatory measures in place. It withheld its support from Kinder Morgan, and at the end of the day, it had to swoop in and buy this pipeline. Members might be thinking that $4.5 billion does not seem like that much and is a pretty good deal. It is not, because this pipeline is only worth about $2 billion. Therefore, we are paying $4.5 billion for a pipeline that is worth $2 billion, and we did not even need to spend a dime on it because it would have been built based on private money from Kinder Morgan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495877">In addition to that, we could talk about the veterans. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was recently at a town hall where he was asked why he was not investing more money into veterans. He had the audacity to say to these wounded veterans that we just do not have the money right now. The government has $7 billion for a slush fund, $35 billion for China, $4.5 billion for a pipeline that the government did not need to purchase because it was going to go into the ground if the government would have just let it, yet it does not have money for veterans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495878">At a time when the government should be focused on making life more affordable for Canadians by getting out of the way, it is focusing on implementing more regulations and slamming Canadians with more taxes. The current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is failing Canadian families over and over again. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495879">Recently, there was an Ipsos Reid poll that came out in December. It said that about half of Canadian families are within $200 a month of not being able to pay their household bills. That is a very slim margin. If their expenses go up by $200, they will no longer be able to pay their bills. That is a big deal. It is especially a big deal when we have a federal government in place that is trying to implement a carbon tax, which will definitely boost the household debt load.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495880">Let us talk about that carbon tax. We are not talking about a little tax. We are talking about a big tax. We are talking about a tax on everything. We are talking about a tax that is going to be imposed on home heating, fuel, and electricity. Anything that requires fossil fuels in order to get it to market or in its production will be taxed. We are talking about clothing, shoes, food, and camping equipment. All of that will have a tax applied to it. Not only that, but the GST will also have a tax applied to it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495881">Albertans have been paying a carbon tax since January 1, 2017. I thought that I would do a little survey with those in my riding and ask them if the carbon tax has changed their behaviour, because that is the theory, that it will somehow change people's consumption patterns. I asked a few questions in this survey. I asked if people did not need to heat their homes in winter, if they no longer needed to drive to work on a consistent basis, if they stopped buying groceries, if they no longer required corrective lenses in order to see, if their children no longer needed to be driven to sports practices, if they started to walk their household garbage and recycling to their respective places instead of using curbside pickup, and if they started their own cotton farm and sewed their own clothes. I even asked my farmers if they reverted to using a plow. I did not get a single positive response. We are shocked. We would expect the carbon tax to change these behaviours. However, it has not. It is an absolute joke. It is simply a tax that the current government is imposing on every single Canadian. It will do nothing to reduce greenhouse gases, as proven by B.C., and it will do nothing to change our behaviours and our consumption patterns. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495882">We rely on fossil fuels to live everyday life. That needs to be acknowledged in this place as a fact. To pretend that it is not so is absolutely ignorant of the government. Therefore, with regard to this carbon tax, I would call upon the government to back off and put measures in place that are supportive of Canadian families instead of harmful. A government's responsibility is to look out for the well-being of its citizens, to provide an environment where they can prosper, where their dreams can be made into reality, where they can thrive. I call upon the government to create that environment, because that is the Canada that every single Canadian from coast to coast deserves.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495898">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today in the House of Commons. I have been here for about six months now, and every single day, it is such a privilege and honour to be here with members of all parties. I think we are all here for the right reasons. We want to serve Canadians to the best of our ability and in the best interest of our constituents. Sometimes we have different ideas of what is best for our constituents, but I know that in our hearts, we all want to do what is right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495899">I rise to speak on the issue of the main estimates and the Liberal government's extraordinary use of vote 40 to circumvent parliamentary oversight and accountability. We are debating this today because of how uncommon the circumstances are surrounding these estimates. For the first time, outside of a major economic crisis, the government is using measures to spend over $7 billion with little parliamentary oversight. The Liberals are claiming that they are doing this to improve accountability and transparency, but outside of their own echo chamber, and outside of the musings of some mandarins, there is little to substantiate those claims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495900">For those of you watching at home, I would like to outline the importance of the main estimates and their role in the budget process. Main estimates are a tool used by the government to allocate funds from Treasury Board to various departments based upon the estimated amount of funds needed to achieve the government's policy goals. Sometimes these estimates fall short, and supplementary estimates are used to allocate further funds. This is usually done because of unforseen circumstances, such as a natural disaster or an economic catastrophe, such as the 2008 recession.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495901"> Estimates are also an essential tool for parliamentarians to hold government accountable, because they provide the means by which we measure government spending and also hold it to its commitments, should the spending go higher than estimated or should the government fall short of its commitments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495902">Recently, one of the most important debates regarding the main estimates has been taking place in this chamber and has also been taking place in some committees, although we have seen the government unwilling to engage in debate or even in talks about this matter at committee. I am specifically talking about vote 40.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495903">Vote 40, according to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, is a novel innovation by the government. A similar measure was used most recently during the 2009 recession as an extraordinary means to get critical funding out the door. At the time, in the face of a rapidly deteriorating economy, government stimulus was needed to protect jobs. The fact that this was such an extraordinary circumstance justified the use of this measure. However, it has not been used for day-to-day purposes until the current government decided to use it. Today the Liberal government, ostensibly in its effort to streamline the budget process, has decided to use this measure, but in reality, it will reduce accountability and transparency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495904">To get to the crux of the matter, the Liberal government is voting to allocate over $7 billion without telling Canadians or parliamentarians what that money will be spent on. In recent committee testimony, many departments that came before the committee were unable to explain what the monies they were receiving in the vote would be used for. In some cases, individual departments are being allocated hundreds of millions of dollars and cannot even explain what the plans are to spend that money. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495905">This is not chump change. This is hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer resources that could be going toward paying down mortgages, paying for children's education, or saving for retirement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495906">Canadians expect that when they pay taxes, they can trust that the government will spend on things that are important to taxpayers, and most importantly, that there is transparency regarding what those things are and what the outcomes of those things will be. Canadians do not write blank cheques to the government, and they certainly do not want to give the Treasury Board Secretariat, which is a department that most Canadians know very little about, the authority to spend money without Parliament's oversight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495907"> My constituents in Sturgeon River—Parkland, like most normal Canadians, do not want to spend their time thinking about the nuances of Treasury Board submissions or funding guidelines, but they rightfully expect me, as their member of Parliament, to care about these things on their behalf. They expect me to hold the government accountable, whether my party is in government or in opposition, to ensure that those funds are spent in a way that is measurable, transparent, and fundamentally subject to parliamentary oversight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495908">We cannot take this issue lightly. The actions of Parliament today set the precedent for Parliament in the future. By going down this route today, the government is opening the floodgates that will erode some of the means by which parliamentarians, and indeed Canadians, can hold their government to account.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495909">In case some back home are wondering if this is not just something that their Conservative member of Parliament is blowing out of proportion, I want to direct them to comments made by the Parliamentary Budget Officer, who is a non-partisan official, and whose mandate is to scrutinize the government and its actions. In regard to vote 40, in his own words he says, “With the money requested for TB Vote 40, TBS is effectively requesting that Parliament provide funding in advance of this scrutiny”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495910">Drawing some historical parallels, in the 17th century, the king of England, King Charles I sought to spend money without parliamentary oversight. He refused to even allow Parliament to convene when they would not give him what he wanted. It led to civil war, and as a consequence of Parliament winning that civil war, we gained the privileges in the Westminster system that we have today. One of those privileges is, chiefly, the right of oversight over government spending decisions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495911">What the government has labelled as reform may help the government get the money out the door faster, but it is undermining accountability and transparency in its efforts to do so, and that is not a trade-off my constituents are willing to make. It is not a trade-off I am willing to make. In fact, much of the information surrounding this spending will not be available until after the next election, effectively giving the government what many of my colleagues have called a slush fund to spend on whatever it may want before the next election, with little oversight for us as parliamentarians or for Canadians. In effect, it is going to be denying Canadians the evidence they need to render a verdict on the government until after the next election. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495912">How are Canadians to know, especially when we are talking about deficits that were supposed to be $10 billion and are now $20 billion. Going year after year, how are we supposed to get a sense of what the value is for those monies when the government has now been setting a precedent through vote 40 to spend $7 billion without government oversight. How are Canadians supposed to have that accountability? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495913">I also know that the Auditor General is very concerned, in a much more general manner. In a recent document and report he outlined his concerns with the government's spending plans. To paraphrase, he said that with this government the measure of success has become the amount of money spent, rather than approved outcomes. This is a damning assessment from the Auditor General that casts doubt on whether taxpayers' resources are being used in the best manner by the government. Instead, it looks like they are just trying to shovel it out the door as if it is a virtue to spend taxpayers' money, rather than spending it for the best possible result for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495914">In committee, my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214254" Type="2">Edmonton West</Affiliation>, has been holding the government's feet to the fire to try to get some transparency over the $7 billion appropriation. The government is playing a game of ping pong with the opposition, telling them to ask departmental officials what the individual funds are allocated for. However, when those departmental officials are asked, they claim it would be preposterous for them to know what the money is going to be used for. This level of stonewalling occurring on this measure is truly astounding, and for the government to so frivolously administer taxpayer funds is truly disturbing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495915">It is troubling, the Orwellian Newspeak coming out of the government. When Conservatives ask how much the carbon tax will cost Canadians, the Liberals claim the information is out there, but when we ask for the information in an access to information request, they black out the document to hide the true cost to Canadians families. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495916">Day after day we ask, and day after day they refuse to answer. We also see that the government increasingly wants to move its spending off the books, so that Canadians do not get to see how it is spent. They are trying to interfere with the Canada pension plan, our national retirement savings, to bail out the government's disastrous intervention on the Kinder Morgan pipeline, an intervention that would not be necessary at all if the government had just stood up for the energy industry and unequivocally backed the pipeline in the national interest, instead of standing back and letting the project fall apart under its watch.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495917">The Liberals have also created this new infrastructure bank, and they are shifting resources that could have been used for infrastructure in communities to the bank, so that it reduces transparency. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495918">Finally, to what we are talking about today, vote 40, where the Liberals claim they want to improve accountability and transparency, they are actually removing parliamentary oversight and asking taxpayers to trust that the government knows best.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495919">My constituents demand better from the government. They demand transparency and accountability on how the Liberal government is spending their money. I look forward to spending tonight voting to hold the government accountable for its carbon tax cover-up. I look forward to the months to come, where I will continue to fight for my constituents to hold the government accountable. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495920">Mr. Speaker, throughout the day, I have been hearing references to Australia, which is a country I know well as my parents were born there and it is the place where my cousins live. Email is a fantastic thing because I get to ask them in real time about what happened after carbon pricing was removed in Australia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495921"> My cousins in Victoria will tell us that electricity prices tripled the first year it was gone because the price on coal was removed. The price on coal, which is largely exported to China, was being used to subsidize electricity in Australia for clean energy. When the carbon price was removed, it opened up the coal mines, which was not good for the environment but also tripled the price of electricity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495922">For those who are really concerned about what the cost of gasoline is in Australia, they might want to check what happened with the gasoline prices there. At the point of the carbon tax being in place, gasoline was going for $1 a litre in Australia. Today it is $1.88 a litre. Why? Because the private market dictates the price, not government taxes. It is the market price for fuel that is the issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495923"> The trouble in Australia is that it is losing port capacity because of erosion, due to massive floods caused by climate change. Climate change has eroded the Australians' capacity to import cheap energy and so energy prices are going up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495924">If the members opposite really want to follow Australia's example, could they explain why farmers should pay $1.88 for a litre of gasoline? Could they explain why coal in manufacturing is the preferred method of energy generation? Could they please explain why they want to triple the price of electricity?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495926">When we are talking about Australia, we should note that in Australia the vast majority of coal used in there is metallurgical coal, which is used in steelmaking, which is shipped to China. We are not talking about coal from coal-fired power plants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495927"> When the member talks about removing a carbon tax and increasing the cost of fuel for people in Australia, the evidence does not match up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495928">Australia, unlike Canada, is not a largely oil and gas producing country. It is a completely different economy, and it is captive to the countries from which it needs to import oil and gas. We should be looking at why those reasons are causing its increases, not transporting them to Canada and trying to say that raising taxes on Canadians is going to lower our cost of living.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5495932">Mr. Speaker, today I came here to talk about the main estimates and how the government was trying to pull off a new measure in order to hide the $7 billion in spending. However, the member for <Affiliation DbId="213909" Type="2">Esquimalt—Saanich—Sooke</Affiliation> asked a very important question on carbon pricing and the effects of climate change, which we do know have a significant effect on the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495933">However, where we fundamentally disagree is when we have policies that are putting a tax on everyday Canadians, on everything from their groceries to their fuel.

              <ParaText id="5495934">As a country, we really need to look for technological solutions.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5495935">Mr. Speaker, it has been an interesting day to say the least. We have heard the Conservatives talk a great deal about taxation. They talk a lot about revenue, among a few other things. I was hoping to take this opportunity to share with my friends across the way a few thoughts, maybe introduce a few facts, and see if they could realize some of the errors in their ways and possibly reflect on the reality of the situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495936">Where to start? The Conservatives continuously try to push a myth. The Government of Canada has been very strong in terms of good sound environmental policy. We have witnessed that virtually since day one, when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> went to Paris with a number of different stakeholders, including provinces, indigenous peoples, and others. He came back as the signatory to a fantastic agreement, which was actually being acted upon around the world. At the time, we had countries all around the world recognizing that we do need to put a price on pollution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495937">Then the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and cabinet focused on getting provinces together to have a discussion. It was an historical agreement that we needed to look at the environment and look at a price on pollution. It should not be of any great surprise, in fact well over 80% of Canadians already have a system in place where there is a price on pollution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495938">This gets us right to that whole issue of a myth that the Conservatives are trying to say exists today. It is as if there is going to be this super-huge tax coming between now and 2019, and whether it is true or not, it does not really matter because the Conservatives are going to say it is true. They want to plant the seeds of doubt and fear in Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495939">Truth be known, when it comes to taxation, the government has nothing to learn from members opposite. In reality, we just need to look at the actions of the Conservative Party since the last federal election. Those who might be following the debate would be very much aware that one of the very first initiatives of the government was a substantial tax break for Canada's middle class. There is absolutely no doubt about that. There was a clear tax break, at the same time there was, in fairness, a tax increase to Canada's wealthiest 1%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495940">The Conservative Party voted against that. On the one hand, Conservatives are saying, “Look out, Canadians, the Government of Canada wants to impose a tax.” In fact, that is not the case. In reality, it is the Conservatives who voted against a tax decrease to Canada's middle class.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495941">I listened to hours of Conservative after Conservative standing up and clearly demonstrating that they are in fact completely out of touch. They are not listening to what Canadians expect from good government, a government that will demonstrate leadership on important files. The price on pollution is one of those issues that the government takes very seriously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495942">It was interesting. I heard one member from the Conservative Party talk about the importance of revenue. She made reference to the fact that we develop natural resources or we raise taxes, or we increase the deficit. Those are the three things she focused on. We have heard a lot coming from the members opposite. I can comment on each and every one of those separately, but there was one that she missed out on, growing the economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495943">The government, working with Canadians in all regions of our nation, has witnessed some of the greatest growth in terms of real jobs. We are talking in excess of 600,000, most of which are full-time jobs that have been created as a direct result of Canadians working with the government to ensure that every region has seen a benefit, in a very real and tangible way.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="00">(2100)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5495944">If we grow the economy, we also grow the revenue of the government, and that is something the Conservatives have completely forgotten.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495945"> If there is an area in which Stephen Harper demonstrated failure, it is dealing with development in the prairie provinces. I could come up with a number of examples, but one example that has often been referred to today and in the past number of days is the issue of natural resources, in particular the Trans Mountain expansion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495946">One would think that the Conservative Party would have been happy when the Government of Canada made the decision to acquire assets so that we could move forward with a pipeline to tidewater. For months, they were asking where the pipeline was, and to show them the pipeline. Stephen Harper failed at delivering. Not one inch of pipeline to tidewater was built under his government in 10 years. In two and a half years, we have put in place an opportunity that will see a pipeline to tidewater actually built. I believe everyone in the Prairies will recognize that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495947">The Conservatives are nervous about this and say that we spent public money on the issue. Why did Stephen Harper invest in the automobile industry when it looked like it was not going to survive? He did that because it was in the national interest to do so. The Conservatives spent billions and billions on the automobile industry, a lot more than we will be spending on the Trans Mountain expansion, with no reservations. We recognize that as a positive thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495948">Today, the hundreds of thousands of jobs we have in the automobile industry might not have been here if the government had not become involved. That means the Conservative Party can be brought into doing the right thing at times. It can be a challenge to drag the Conservatives into doing something that is right. In the back rooms, they would probably concede that the government acquiring the assets of the pipeline is a good thing, but they cannot say that publicly. Shame on them for not recognizing that the national interest and Alberta are worth it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495949"> If they are prepared to fight for the automobile industry in the national interest, they should have been prepared to fight for Canada getting involved and investing in a national pipeline. However, every one of the Conservative members of Parliament from Alberta did nothing but criticize this government consistently throughout. At least there are some Albertan MPs on the government benches that recognize the true value in terms of what is happening here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495950">We can contrast that with my NDP friends, who have made it very clear. Rachel Notley, the NDP Premier of Alberta, understands, as this government does, that when it comes to the environment and the economy, they go hand in hand. We have heard the government talk about that now for over two years, and the pipeline is an excellent example of this. Like NDP Premier Rachel Notley, we believe that the Trans Mountain expansion is in the best interest of our nation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="05">(2105)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5495951">The NDP, on the other hand, at the national level here in Ottawa said no. Let there be no doubt that they are, in my opinion, completely abandoning the province of Alberta, and I would argue beyond Alberta to include the Prairies. They are abandoning what is in the national interest. That is shameful. If they cannot support this particular pipeline, then what pipeline can they support? They do not support any pipeline. They are trying to out-green the Green Party. They believe there is no need for a pipeline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495952">I come from Manitoba, which is a beautiful province. We have unfortunately been in a position where we have been receiving literally billions of dollars every year through equalization payments. Contrast that to Alberta. Alberta generates on the positive side billions of dollars every year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495953">What is the difference between Manitoba and Alberta? Many of my constituents would say that Alberta was somewhat blessed by having a lot of oil. There is no doubt that oil has really been responsible for a lot of the success of Alberta, and it has contributed immensely to the many different social programs. If we did not receive those billions of dollars, we would not be able to provide that quality health care that we have in Manitoba, the type of education we provide, the repairs, and many other wonderful things, including financing environmentally sound projects. The Government of Canada, the provinces, and the different regions have benefited immensely by Alberta and its contributions through equalization payments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495954">My New Democratic friends want to throw that out the window. NDP Rachel Notley has said that they have a cap. They are being very responsible with respect to the environment. That is something we have recognized. Even the New Democrats will say Rachel Notley is being wonderful and she is abiding by emissions and she has this cap. The only thing that they disagree with her about is that she wants the pipeline. However, the pipeline is all part of the Rachel Notley package. One cannot cherry-pick and say that the pipeline is a bad idea to Rachel Notley or to the NDP in Alberta. They will never agree to that. Only the national New Democrats will agree, and team up with the B.C. New Democrats.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495955">I find that the New Democrats are making a big mistake. We will see that once we get the pipeline moving forward and the jobs being created, and the potential for ongoing revenues, all in an environmentally sound way that incorporates different levels of government, indigenous peoples, and many other stakeholders. That is in regard to that source of revenue. In terms of natural resources, that was often referred to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495956">One never runs out of incidences of hypocrisy within the collective Conservative caucus when it comes to the issue of deficits. Imagine that we have the Conservative Party of Canada trying to give advice on what is good or bad when it comes to deficit financing. Let me expand as to why I say that. When Stephen Harper actually became the prime minister of Canada, he inherited a multi-billion dollar surplus. Even before the recession started in Canada, not only did he blow the surplus, he created another deficit.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="10">(2110)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5495957">It was a whopper of a deficit. It was a multi-billion dollar deficit. It took him no time whatsoever to do that. My friend across the way says we told him to spend more. Have I got news for him. Saying the Liberals told him to do it does not cut it with Canadians. The Conservatives are the ones who turned a multi-billion dollar surplus into a multi-billion dollar deficit in a year. Then, they continued to add billions of dollars to it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495958">We have heard the Conservatives say they want to see a balanced budget within four years. They could not do it. In budget after budget, and I could say that nine or 10 times, they kept on adding to the deficit. The total was over $170 billion of Conservative debt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495959">Then when they tried to get it to balance, what did they do? I told members about their purchase of GM shares. They tried to sell $1 billion of GM shares to try to cover their back ends, to try to give the false impression that they know how to balance a budget 10 years later. It is a stretch.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495960">I am hoping that those listening, and Canadians, will understand that when it comes to the balancing of a budget, or the managing of an economy, or dealing with important issues related to the environment, this government understands what Canadians expect of it. We have a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who consistently says within his caucus that as members of Parliament, we are to bring our concerns from the constituencies we represent to Ottawa, and build the types of budgets and support programs that we believe Canadians expect of good governance. That is, in fact, what we have witnessed, budget after budget, with respect to Liberal budgets. I believe that Canadians are quite satisfied with the priorities this government has.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495961">I made reference to the number of jobs. We created 600,000-plus jobs over two years. We believe in Canada's middle class. Canada's middle class is our number one priority, and that predates the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> becoming prime minister. When he was elected the leader of the Liberal Party, one of the very first statements he made was about getting behind Canada's middle class and supporting it, and supporting those who are aspiring to be a part of it. That has been priority one with this government from day one, and it will continue to be a priority of this government. If we invest in Canada's middle class, ultimately we are going to have a healthier economy. It is the middle class, and those aspiring to be a part of it, that push the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495962">Let me give members a specific example. Every month, millions of dollars goes into Winnipeg North, the riding I represent, through two programs that have been greatly enhanced by this government. One is the Canada child benefit and the other is the guaranteed income for seniors. These programs lifted hundreds of seniors and children out of poverty in Winnipeg North, and the same principle applies across this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495963">Those individuals are consumers, and they are participating in the economy. They are helping to create the jobs that ultimately led this government, working with Canadians, to generate over 600,000 jobs. The Conservative Party votes against every progressive initiative, whether it is increasing funding to Canada's poorest seniors or supporting the children in our communities or giving tax breaks to Canada's middle class or giving the 1% a tax hike. It is never-ending.</ParaText>

Some of them said earlier that they believe climate change is not caused by humans, but a side effect of human activity. That is why they think they can go on extracting oil, western Canada's dirty oil, even if it causes terrible, negative consequences, since they do not acknowledge them.

Ultimately, different provinces will also benefit from those additional revenues that will be generated. Many of the initiatives that will be taken will promote and encourage a healthier environment, clean technology, and all sorts of research capabilities.

However, if they read the document that was made public back on April 1, there is all sorts of information in there.

              <ParaText id="5495995">Here we are, in the final moments of debate, the penultimate opportunity to speak to the 2018-19 main estimates. I am delighted to have this opportunity. For the benefit of folks looking in from home, the main estimates are supposed to list and outline the resources required by individual departments and agencies for the upcoming fiscal year, in order to deliver the programs for which they are responsible. The main estimates are supposed to be allotments of dollars and cents, many dollars and cents, aligned with specific spending plans, laid out by the government in the budget for the fiscal year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495996">As we know, budget 2018 was not an economic document. It was a virtue signalling, social engineering, shamelessly pandering, ideologically preoccupied pitch to what one respected national commentator described as “every conceivable Liberal client group and policy cult”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495997">This year, in budget 2018 the government told Canadians that total government revenues this year, taxes primarily, would amount to about $324 billion. Total expenditures by the government and its agencies and departments would be about $339 billion, leaving the budget in a deficit of more than $18 billion. Let us remember, this major deficit is much more than the modest deficits promised by the Liberals, and that their promise of a balanced budget by next year will also be broken, along with so many of their original 2015 campaign promises.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495998">Getting back to the main estimates and how they are supposed to work, the various spending authorities are called “votes” with the amounts to be included in future appropriation bills that Parliament will be asked to approve to enable the government to proceed with its spending plans. That is the way it is supposed to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5495999">Members may recall the days when finance ministers explained in detail the planned expenditures to Parliament and to Canadians. Not here, there are scores of unknown and undetailed spending elements in the main estimates for 2018-19. That is why so many of my colleagues have shared with the House and Canadians their concern that the Liberals are changing the rules to suit their own suspect agenda.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5496000">Is “suspect” too extreme a characterization? I do not think so. After hearing so many opposition speakers, I am sure the Speaker shares our concerns regarding the unacceptable way the Liberals are trying to hide their spending intentions from Canadians. For example, we have the oft-referenced $7.4-billion example. Vote 40, a $7.4-billion vote, is either an attempt to hide next year's election year goodies funding, like the many million dollars dumped into the Quebec riding facing a by-election in just a very days, or it was a very large contingency fund to cover the <Affiliation DbId="214341" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation>'s unidentified spending priorities, as set by the direction of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and cabinet to avoid parliamentary oversight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5496001">This $7.4 billion has been quite properly characterized by our shadow finance minister, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214462" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>, as nothing more than a Liberal election-year slush fund. At committee earlier this month, departments that had received major allotments were unable to give meaningful answers about millions of dollars they were to receive or how the spending of those millions will be reported, if ever at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5496002">Instead, in something of a puppet show, Treasury Board officials stepped in to offer their answers for the department officials who could not. When it came time at that meeting to ask questions about how the mysterious $7.4 billion apparent slush fund would be spent, the Liberal members of committee walked out. Their abandonment of committee killed quorum, leaving those questions unanswered, as they are still unanswered today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5496003">Among the scores of unanswered questions is another glaring question, which was debated in the House earlier today. That question involves the Liberal refusal to tell Canadians just how much the carbon tax obligations they have downloaded on the provinces to collect will cost the average Canadian family. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="35">(2135)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5496004">The Liberals know the answer. They will not tell us, and they will not tell Canadians. They have provided a document that quite clearly focuses on the potential impact of a carbon price on household consumption expenditures, but when the document comes to key findings, there is a blackout. Most segments of the rest of the document are redacted, hidden behind solid ink black blocks. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5496005">Members will recall that under our previous Conservative government, Canada worked to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by regulation. Even though Canada generates less than 2%, now far less than 2%, of the world's annual emissions, we acknowledged that we would work with the provinces to carefully reduce emissions while at the same time ensuring that we protected the economy, even as we protected the environment, lines that have since been taken by the Liberal minister and reiterated, by rote, in question period almost every day. As a result, our Conservative government was the first in history to achieve tangible, significant reductions of greenhouse gases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5496006"> We started with the transportation sector, the largest-emitting sector, and we created, in partnership with the United States, tailpipe regulations, which are reducing car and light-truck emissions and will, by 2025, reduce those emissions by 50%, and which will consume 50% less fuel. We set new regulations for heavy-duty trucks and buses that are seeing emissions from these vehicles, by this year, reduced by up to 23%, which means a saving of up to $8,000 a year for a semi-truck operator driving a newly purchased 2018 model vehicle. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5496007">We set marine emission guidelines, began work with the aviation and rail sectors, and then moved on to the next-largest emission sector: coal-fired electricity generating plants. We set emission-reduction regulations, and our former Conservative government imposed a ban on the construction of any new coal-fired units, the first government in the world to implement such a ban.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5496008">In every one of those emission-reducing regulations, scientists and economists at Environment Canada conducted a cost-benefit study, and in every one of those situations, we were able to show that the benefits of the regulations outweighed the costs. The regulated sectors and the provinces and the consumers knew what careful, reasonable regulation would cost. That is why we are so concerned by the Liberals' refusal to come clean on the estimated cost to the average Canadian family of their carbon tax. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5496009">I would like to end with just a couple of statements by past and present parliamentary budget officers. Former PBO, Kevin Page, said, of the unaccounted billions in the main estimates, “Financial control and ministerial accountability are being undermined.” He said that of the current government and the main estimates and the budget. Mr. Page said, “This is a new low for our appropriation system.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5496010">The current PBO said, “virtually none of the money requested in the new Budget Implementation vote has undergone scrutiny through the standard Treasury Board Submission process.” In effect, the current Parliamentary Budget Officer is saying that the government is getting the money through its majority, without proper scrutiny and accountability to this elected House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5496011">Therefore, we in the official opposition will, in the coming many hours, stand so many times, proudly, to oppose the Liberals' unexplained, undocumented, and unaccounted removal of billions of dollars from the national treasury, to be spent in ways that can only be described as highly suspect in the coming election year.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5496023">Mr. Speaker, I know the answer came from the other side, “Just watch us.” The glaring problem that not only we in the official opposition and the NDP, but all Canadians see is the manner in which the Liberal government disrespected accountability and transparency in committee. A member seemed to celebrate when I made the point that, when questions came around to the $7.4-billion slush fund, the Liberal committee members actually left the committee, killed quorum, and refused to answer questions, which they and the <Affiliation DbId="214341" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation> still refuse to answer today.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5496024">Mr. Speaker, I hope the <Affiliation DbId="214341" Type="4">Treasury Board president</Affiliation> will stand fast for questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5496025"> I am pleased to rise today to speak to the Liberal slush fund, vote 40 of the estimates. I want to quote from King Edward I when he said, “what touches all, should be approved by all, and it is also clear that common dangers should be met by measures agreed upon in common”. King Edward originally said this in 1295 when calling the model parliament. At the time, legislative authority was limited primarily to levying taxes. I am sure the current government would love to go back to that era when all parliament did was levy taxes. Edward's goal at the time was to raise funds for the campaign against the Scots and the French, nobel causes I guess, unless one happens to be French or Scottish. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5496026">What does this have to do with the budget? Some 753 years ago, King Edward I, in calling the model parliament, set up new functions for spending approvals and addressing grievances. The estimates, with their odious vote 40, violate such long-held functions of what touches all should be approved by all. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5496027">What is vote 40? It is basically a slush fund. I will give a quick glossary of some of the items we talked about today. For those watching at home wondering what we are doing, the estimates are basically the spending authority. The budget of course is just an aspirational thing. It is like having a plan to put something together, like perhaps a hockey rink on Parliament Hill, and they might come up with a budget of $8 million. Actually cutting the cheque and paying for it would be in the estimates, which is the spending authority. The public accounts, which I will talk about later, are the books that reconcile all the spending at the end of the year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5496028">I want to read the PBO's letter about the public accounts, because it is important. Not one penny of the spending from the slush fund is going to show up detailed in the public accounts, unlike items such as the hockey rink, or perhaps the $200,000 Twitter account for the <Affiliation DbId="233811" Type="4">health minister</Affiliation>. The $7.4 billion will not show up detailed in the public accounts. The <Affiliation DbId="214341" Type="4">Treasury Board president</Affiliation> has tried to say otherwise, but the PBO says that currently the main summaries in volume 2, etc. provide dollar amounts to all authorities being transferred from each central vote. The spending data is rolled up and provided as a total number, not detailed, just a lump sum transfer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5496029">There is no accountability for where this money is going to be spent. Why is that? It is basically to cover up the failed actions of the <Affiliation DbId="214341" Type="4">Treasury Board president</Affiliation>. He promised us easier understanding of the spending, alignment of the estimates to the budget, and more transparency. We actually got the opposite. We get ministers not coming to committee to defend their spending. We have the Liberal members of the operations committee blocking. We tried repeatedly to add other meetings to have ministers and officials come and explain their spending. We were blocked. We had one extra meeting and Liberal members of OGGO actually walked out, denying us quorum. They had a chance to debate the $7.4 billion. It was the very first item we were debating. They walked out and deprived us the right to actually talk about it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5496030">The voters put us here to approve all that touches us, and the Liberals are trying to stop us. They are the same people who gave us ad scam, the same people who had 10% of their cabinet under ethics investigations. It would have been 13%, but they threw out one of the members, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214134" Type="2">Calgary Centre</Affiliation>. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">finance minister </Affiliation> have been investigated under ethics. Of course it was not the first finance minister investigated. The current<Affiliation DbId="214300" Type="4"> public safety minister</Affiliation>, when he was finance minister, was also investigated for ethics. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5496031">With all these ethics issues, these are the same people who are saying give us $7 billion of taxpayers' money with no oversight, no plan, and no scrutiny. Remember, not one penny of the $7.4 billion slush fund shows up in any of the departmental plans. Why is that? We were told the plans are not mature. We were told they could not tell us what the money is for in the slush fund because they have not come up with a plan. They have no backup on how they got to the $7.4 billion and what will be spent from the program, but they do want us to preapprove it. they want it to be spent and never seen again. The government's own lauded GC InfoBase, which it claims will show the spending, will only show what the public accounts show. A lump sum transfer will not show details. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5496032">In committee, we asked procurement and public services what the details were of the two-thirds of a billion dollars in vote 40. We asked what the money was going to be used for, what results they were hoping to achieve. We were told they were preparing a case to go to Treasury Board, and when they do they will have that information for us. Not now, not in advance, but once they know what they are going to spend it on they will get back to us. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="50">(2150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5496033">I asked if they had the information now and I was told no.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5496034">We asked the <Affiliation DbId="233810" Type="4">procurement minister</Affiliation> if she thought that Parliament should rubber-stamp $650 million of taxpayers' money without a plan on how to spend it. When we asked how she even came up with this total, we were told to check with Treasury Board Secretariat. Maybe the <Affiliation DbId="214341" Type="4">Treasury Board president</Affiliation> could tell us how he came to that $650 million. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5496035">We asked about the $300 million for Phoenix and why there was no breakdown of spending details. I was told it would be presumptuous to put it in the departmental plan when the money had not even been approved by Parliament or by Treasury Board.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5496036">We are asked to pre-approve money in vote 40 with zero backup, yet we are told it is presumptuous to expect a budget or details. Imagine going to a bank and saying, “Give me a million-dollar loan.” The bank manager asks me what I want it for and I say I am not going to tell. I tell the manager to give me the money and let me spend it, but I will not say what I spent it on. However, I say I will provide a copy of the cancelled cheque to show it was spent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5496037">It is no different with vote 40. We have repeatedly asked what the money is to be used for and the government tells us it does not know. How is this being accountable to taxpayers? How are we going to see what we are getting for the money? We do not know. Not one penny of that is in the departmental plans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5496038"> The government goes on and on about trying to provide safe drinking water on reserves. There is $100 million in vote 40, but it does not show up in the government's departmental plans. Not once does it show up as a target on how or what the government is going to achieve with that $100 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5496039">I asked someone in Treasury Board about the $300 million. I asked for a breakdown, because that money could be used for anything. What is stopping the government from spending that $300 million by providing a thousand dollar payout to every single employee as a reward for putting up with Phoenix? I was told nothing is to stop the government from doing that. The government is actually being sued by the public service. The gentleman from Treasury Board was intimating that perhaps that is what the money was going to be used for. Again we do not know what it is going to be used for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5496040">We asked Privy Council officials about their spending and we were told they could not tell us the details because the money is not approved yet. They do not have a plan as to how that money will be spent. Who is the minister responsible for the Privy Council? It is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. This is a perfect example of what is going on with this department and what the plan is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5496041"> We have heard throughout the evening from Liberal members that the Parliamentary Budget Officer supports them. They say the previous Parliamentary Budget Officer supported them. Here is the truth. This is what Kevin Page, the former Parliamentary Budget Officer has to say about the vote 40 slush fund. He said that there was no way that this was an improvement. He did not say it could be okay, or maybe there was some good stuff about it. He said there was no way that this was an improvement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5496042">The PBO says that because not one penny in the slush fund is in the departmental plans, so the estimates and the budget cannot be considered aligned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5496043">The <Affiliation DbId="214341" Type="4">Treasury Board president</Affiliation> is taking away accountability and transparency under the guise of making it easier for Canadians to understand because it is now aligned. However, here we have the Parliamentary Budget Officer, who he was happy to quote earlier supporting vote 40, telling us that the Treasury Board president's main reason for taking away accountability has not even achieved real alignment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5496044">I want to finish with a final word from the Parliamentary Budget Officer. He said, “Over the past twenty years, the Executive Branch has gradually ceded additional support and control to Parliament.” Perhaps we could go 753 years back to the model Parliament, but Treasury Board vote 40 would represent an inflection point in this trend going the other way, where Parliament would now receive incomplete information and be able to exercise less control. He goes on to say that the main problem, as has been stated before by him and as said by the Treasury Board president, is not the alignment of the estimates; it is the government's inability to get their programs out the door. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5496045">He states in his review of the estimates process that parliamentarians have to decide whether it is worth it to allow the government to continue their incompetent way of getting the programs out the door and to allow them a blank check to spend $7.4 billion of taxpayers' money rather than getting their act together.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5497513">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to speak today about Hong Kong. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5497514">Hong Kong is a special and beautiful place. It also in many ways is a place of contrast. Breathtaking natural beauty is interspersed with urban beauty as apartments rise and mountains rise even higher. East meets west and the cutting edge of modernity grows in an environment with clear and evident tradition. It is also a place that has unfortunately never known true democracy, yet which is also historically at a very high level of freedom.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5497515">I went to Hong Kong last fall with our foreign affairs committee and quickly fell in love with it. It is a beautiful place possessed of an inspiring order, poise, and dignity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5497516">Hong Kong is part of China and it has an important role to play as a light for freedom in China. When Hong Kong joined China, it was under a commitment that Hong Kong's distinctiveness would be respected. The structure was to be one country, two systems. It has a genuine market economy and it has a legislature.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5497517">However, Hong Kong is not a true democracy. There are vast differences in the number of electors in each constituency. In some cases, companies as opposed to individuals are the electors. The system is not a proper democracy and it creates the condition for significant manipulation by the government on the mainland.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5497518">On the other hand, despite lacking proper democratic institutions, the people of Hong Kong stand up for their freedom and for the freedom of all Chinese citizens. During our trip we met with NGOs in Hong Kong who offered us more genuine insight than we were able to receive on the mainland. I met and was inspired by pro-democracy legislators and activists who have risked everything to stand up for their freedom.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5497519">The question that I raised in the House earlier this week with respect to Hong Kong was a question of human rights but also a question of political structure. The Government of Canada needs to stand up for the particular political arrangements that Hong Kong was promised and for the people's fundamental right to real democracy. If China will not keep its commitments to Hong Kong, how can we expect it to keep its commitments to anyone else?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5497520">Perhaps the best illustration of what makes Hong Kong special is what happens on June 4. In 1989, pro-democracy protestors were massacred in Beijing. Troops fired on civilians with automatic weapons and tanks. In every other part of China this occasion is not marked in any public way, but in Hong Kong people mark the occasion and keep the memory of those who died alive on Chinese soil. They did not die in vain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5497521">I raised a specific question about Hong Kong, dealing with the heroes of Hong Kong's democracy movement who are now being given absurd prison sentences for no justifiable reason. Has the government spoken publicly or to the Chinese government about these individual cases or about the declining political situation in Hong Kong in terms of respect for Hong Kong's freedom? Has Hong Kong come up in discussions with the Government of China? We think it should and we would like to know if it has.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5497522">This was my question this week. It was not answered in question period, so I am asking it again. Has the government specifically discussed these cases or the lack of respect for Hong Kong's basic law in general, publicly or directly, with the Government of China?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5497523">Mr. Speaker, after what I know has been a long and difficult night for my colleague across the way, I am glad we have a chance to exchange in this important conversation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5497524">My colleague will know that the promotion and protection of human rights is a core and fundamental part of our foreign policy, and it remains an unwavering priority for our government, for Canadians, and for Canada's engagement abroad. We are well aware of the recent sentencing of Edward Leung Tin-kei for his conviction on the charge of rioting. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5497525">The ability to gather and protest peacefully is a core human right. Hong Kong is widely recognized as an open society with a long tradition of popular engagement in political expression, and we support efforts to ensure this tradition continues. Canada strongly supports the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary in Hong Kong under the one country, two systems principle under Hong Kong basic law. Hong Kong's protection of civil and political rights guaranteed under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights has been essential for the integrity of this framework. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5497526">Canada champions the values of pluralism, democracy, inclusive and accountable governance and respect for diversity, and universal human rights, and we do so at every opportunity. Our government has never and will never hesitate to voice our human rights concerns at every possible opportunity in our exchanges with China. This is a core component of our engagement, of Canada's engagement with China. Canada has expressed concerns about the shrinking space for civil society in China, and raises human rights situations in China with Chinese officials regularly. I have had the chance to do so, as has my colleague sitting beside me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5497527">Canadian engagement on human rights is done in high-level visits, public statements, and outreach to both government officials and civil society in mainland China, Hong Kong, in multilateral fora, and here at home. Canada has consistently called on China to respect, protect, and promote the freedom of opinion and expression, freedom of assembly and association, and freedom of religion or belief of all Chinese citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5497528"> Canada has a strong interest in a stable and prosperous Hong Kong. We share very strong people-to-people ties, and Hong Kong is an important trade and investment partner for Canada. An estimated 300,000 Canadians reside in Hong Kong, and there are approximately 500,000 people of Hong Kong descent living in Canada. Canada and Hong Kong also share a Commonwealth heritage with a number of values, including the rule of law and freedom of expression, which are essential components of Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. Young people in Hong Kong should not be discouraged from exercising their rights of freedom of expression and peaceful demonstration. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5497531">The member said that the Government of Canada took note of these cases. Has the Government of Canada specifically discussed the status of Hong Kong and these particular cases with the Government of China? Have statements been made with respect to that? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5497532">Could the parliamentary secretary clearly communicate the view of the Government of Canada that these particular sentences are unacceptable, that they go outside of the framework established in Hong Kong's basic law, and that action needs to be taken to address the injustices perpetuated in these cases?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5497533">Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, Canadian officials, both on the political side and our tremendous civil servants, always raise our human rights concerns and raise specific cases with our Chinese counterparts at every opportunity. As I said earlier, I have had the chance to do so. My colleague, the parliamentary secretary responsible for consular cases, has done so. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> does when he has the opportunity to do so. Members of the government always raise our human rights concerns, as it is a core and fundamental part of our international engagement everywhere we go. Certainly that holds true in our exchanges in our relationship with our Chinese counterparts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5497534">In addition, Canada and Hong Kong share extensive commercial, institutional, and close people-to-people ties. The ability to gather and protest peacefully is a core human right that we believe in, and we see that it must be protected. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5497535">Our long-standing position is clear. We support the one country, two systems framework. There are rights guaranteed under Hong Kong's basic law, and Canada will continue to call on China to uphold its international human rights obligations.</ParaText>
