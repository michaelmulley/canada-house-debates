The current minimum length for a campaign is 36 days, and there is no explicit maximum length, which was a loophole exploited by the previous Conservative government when it allowed spending limits to increase each day that a campaign exceeded 37 days.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4394024"> Mr. Speaker, in response to part (a) of the question, the number of GEIRA applications received as of April 14, 2016, was 50,530.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394025">Regarding part (b), the number of GEIRA applications approved as of April 14, 2016, was 36,969.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394026">In response to part (c), the number of GEIRA applications denied as of April 14, 2016, was 7,340. In addition, 3,063 incomplete files were closed without a decision being made as a result of applicants not responding to requests for additional information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394027">In terms of the average length of time to process an application, or part (d), in 2014-15, the department processed 74% of applications within the service standard of 26 weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394028">

Regarding the number of applications in backlog, or part (e), as of April14, 2016, 720 applications were in the processing queue for more than the service standard of 26 weeks, which is considered backlog, and 2,163 applications were in the queue for less than 26 weeks, which is inventory. In addition, 275 applications were on hold pending receipt of additional information from applicants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394029">In response to part (f), or how long there has been a backlog of applications, when Bill C-3 was introduced, the department started receiving applications and decided to keep them on file pending the coming into force of the Gender Equity in Indian Registration Act on January 31, 2011. As such, on that date, there was a backlog of 3,900 applications previously put on hold to be processed under the provisions of the new act. The number of applications in the processing queue went up to 9,000 by July 2011, and has been decreasing since then.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394030">Regarding part (g) of the question, the projected date by which the backlog will be eliminated is November 2016. This date is based on the current processing rate, including the number of files to process, the average length of time taken to process an application, and the number of resources available to process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394031">In response to part (h), causes for delays in processing GEIRA applications, delays were in part caused by the initial backlog of applications on hold pending the coming into force of the GEIRA on January 31, 2011, and the initial influx of applications shortly thereafter. In addition, there were a number of workload issues that were resolved in the first year of operation of the GEIRA processing unit. In particular, progress was slowed initially by the need to hire and train a large number of new officers. A 12-month training program is required for officers to process complex GEIRA applications, which require more in-depth genealogical research and analysis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394032">Finally, regarding part (i), the staffing shortage, the department is able to address the backlog situation with existing resources by improving training tools for processing officers, and by modernizing its policies, procedures, and processes, which is resulting in greater operational efficiency.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4394045">It is clear that members from all parties have engaged closely with their constituents, members of other parties, and their own experiences to make thoughtful and genuine contributions to our country's conversation on medical assistance in dying. This is one of the most important issues that this Parliament will address.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394046">Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> represents the government's policy choice to address medical assistance in dying, a choice that is fully informed by consultations with Canadians and experts and takes into account all the interests and values surrounding this matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394047">When the Carter decision came down in February 2015, one debate ended and another began. It was no longer a question of whether Canada would permit medical assistance in dying, but rather it was about how our country would do it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394048">Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> would create a statutory framework for medical assistance in dying that considers the perspectives of those who may wish to access it; those who are concerned about its consequences, including vulnerable persons who could be put at risk by the legalization of this practice; and those who may be asked to provide the assistance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394049">While the Carter decision told us that an absolute prohibition in the former law went too far, it did not tell us how medical assistance in dying should be implemented. The Supreme Court of Canada acknowledged that the issue “involves complex issues of social policy and a number of competing societal values”. The court stated that it:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394050">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">emphasized that there may be a number of possible solutions to a particular social problem, and suggested that a “complex regulatory response” to a social ill will garner a high degree of deference.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394051">The challenge facing Parliament is about setting new boundaries. Who should be eligible for medical assistance in dying; what safeguards should be required; how will it be monitored; and what issues require more study?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394052">A proposed law that answers these questions must comply with the charter, but that does not require replicating the Carter decision. The Supreme Court of Canada has recognized that the relationship between the courts and Parliament should be one of dialogue. Just as Parliament must respect the court's ruling, so too must the court respect Parliament's determination of how to craft a statutory scheme in response to the court's judgment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394053">It is helpful to know how this dialogue has played out in previous instances. For example, in R. v. O'Connor, a 1995 charter challenge in a sexual assault case, the Supreme Court mandated the disclosure of therapeutic records in the Crown's possession and set out a common law procedure for the production of these records.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394054">In response, Parliament enacted a statutory disclosure regime that differed in significant ways from the court's approach. The court upheld the constitutionality of that statutory regime, noting that it could not be presumed, just because Parliament's scheme looked different from what the court had envisioned, that it was unconstitutional. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394055">Instead, there is this dialogue between the legislative branch and the courts. The court can provide the general parameters for a response, but it is for Parliament to craft the regime. Details of that regime matter because they necessarily engage fundamental choices of our rights and values and reconciling the tensions that sometimes exist between them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394056">In developing a response to the Carter decision, the government was called on to simultaneously promote autonomy, protect the vulnerable, affirm life, prevent suicide, support persons with disabilities, respect freedom of conscience, and fully consider many other valuable interests. As we went about this, we remained mindful of our constitutional framework and the divided jurisdiction between Parliament and the provinces and territories. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394057">In weighing these values and making these policy choices, we were not alone. In the past number of months the national conversation on medical assistance in dying has been rich and fulsome, and no doubt it will continue.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4394058">Following the introduction of Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, the relevant standing committees of Parliament, including the justice and human rights committee and the Senate legal and constitutional affairs committee, which conducted the pre-study of the bill, have heard diverse perspectives from stakeholders and experts on all aspects of medical assistance in dying. Bill C-14 strikes a balance regarding eligibility and safeguards, as well as setting out what the federal law should do and what should be left to the provinces and territories to regulate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394059">Not everyone agrees with these policy choices. Still, I am confident that the decisions fall squarely within the range of alternatives that are legally open to Parliament to adopt. It would have been easy for the government to cut and paste the language from the court's decision into a new federal statute, but such an approach would have meant ignoring all the consultations and evidence that I have just referenced. It would also have fallen far short of developing a complex regulatory regime to balance competing interests, which the court said was the task of Parliament to craft and not the courts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394060">That evidence, presented over the past year, confirms that medical assistance in dying may pose risks to the vulnerable, even in circumstances where there is a general consensus that the person should be eligible for the procedure. That is why the bill provides for significant procedural safeguards, even when all of the eligibility criteria are met. This is why the bill would also put in place the necessary legal framework to monitor how medical assistance in dying is implemented in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394061">In terms of eligibility, the policy choice made by the government was to focus on persons who are in an advanced state of irreversible decline and whose natural deaths have become reasonably foreseeable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394062">Recall that medical assistance in dying is exceptional because, from a criminal law perspective, it is a situation where one person actively and knowingly participates in the death of another. We criminalize and strongly condemn this conduct in all other circumstances. The only place in our criminal law where this conduct is justified is in self-defence, where individuals are permitted to take a life but only in order to save their own life or someone else's. While medical assistance in dying has medical and health law aspects to it, we cannot lose sight of this dimension either, because it is the criminal law power that is the primary source of Parliament's jurisdiction to address this issue, and it was the criminal law that, before the Carter decision, stood in the way of medical assistance in dying. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394063">Having given careful consideration to the risks that may be posed when anyone, even a physician or nurse practitioner, is permitted to end another person's life, the balance reflected in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> is that medical assistance in dying should be a choice for Canadians about how they die, so that they may have access to a peaceful passing. The bill would create a complex regulatory regime to respect this choice and ensure it is exercised in a voluntary and fully informed manner. Equally, the criteria ensure that, for Canadians who are not declining toward death, the focus of medicine remains on improving life, not ending it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394064">We also recognize that there are those who believe that the law should permit access to medical assistance in dying in other situations. The government heard these concerns loudly and clearly. The Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights amended the bill to ensure that one or more independent reviews be initiated within six months of the bill receiving royal assent to further examine issues around the eligibility for mature minors, advance requests, and requests where a mental illness is the sole underlying medical condition. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394065">We welcome this amendment and want to emphasize that we will remain open-minded to the evidence that these reviews gather and as Canadian data begins to be generated on how medical assistance in dying is actually working. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394066">The decision to study these three issues further is supported by people who work with patients day in and day out in these three areas, who have been some of the most prominent voices calling for Parliament to proceed with caution. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394067">With respect to mature minors, the Canadian Paediatric Society, represented by Dawn Davies, testified before the Senate committee that there “is simply not enough information to reach an enlightened decision” on this matter and that “It is appropriate that the first iteration of legislation on physician-assisted death does not include...minors”. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4394068">She also stated that there have not been sufficient consultations on this issue. The usual capacity and assessment processes, which Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> supports as appropriate for adults, may not be the right approach for mature minors. We need to consider this issue further.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394069">Advance requests is another area where additional evidence is needed. We have heard many times over the past year that advance requests are likely to be sought in circumstances where persons are suffering from diseases such as Alzheimer's or dementia, but even the Alzheimer Society of Canada has stated in its public position paper that medical assistance in dying should only be possible when a person is competent at the time the assistance is administered. It says that advance requests not only pose risks to vulnerable patients, but they could also contribute to false stereotypes, undermining its message that it is possible to live well with this disease. Further study on this issue is the right policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394070">On mental illness as a sole condition motivating a request for assisted dying, it is not surprising that reputable individuals and organizations, including the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health and the Mental Health Commission of Canada, support further study before legislating in this area. Moving forward in this way does not deny the suffering that these illnesses can cause. Rather, it ensures that we get it right and protect some of the most vulnerable and stigmatized persons in our society. For these reasons, I believe that Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> represents the right policy choices to answer the difficult questions the Supreme Court of Canada left for us as parliamentarians to resolve for 36 million Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394071">I will now turn to the legal considerations, which play a crucial role in this seminal piece of legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394072">A consistent area of discussion has been around whether Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> is constitutional. As the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, I am of the firm opinion that the bill is consistent with the charter and is a justifiable response to the Carter decision. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394073">Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>'s eligibility criteria directly respond to the Carter decision. They clarify the intended scope of eligibility, acknowledging the submission of the Canadian Medical Association, which represents 83,000 physicians who will, with nurse practitioners, be responsible for implementing and applying this law in their daily practice. This organization has stated that the language in the bill is a significant improvement over what it views, from a medical perspective, as the court's unworkable term “grievous and irremediable”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394074">What was the scope of the Carter decision? I appreciate that there are many differing interpretations of the decision, and I acknowledge that the Alberta Court of Appeal recently read Carter in a broad way, while some judges in the Superior Court of Ontario have read it more narrowly. I believe that the Carter decision was about the factual circumstances of that case. At the end of the day, Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> will be measured against the charter as a whole and not the Carter case. As the Alberta Court of Appeal recognized, “the interpretation and constitutionality of eventual legislation should obviously wait until the legislation has been enacted”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394075">Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> addresses both dimensions of section 7 of the charter, respect for autonomy and respect for life. The bill would strike a new balance between these interests through a comprehensive regulatory regime, which would receive deference from the courts. The proposed law would respect individual autonomy for persons who choose medical assistance in dying, but would do so in a careful manner that preserves other crucial objectives: promoting suicide prevention, preventing social stigma of life with a disability, and protecting society's most vulnerable persons from a risk of premature involuntary death.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394076">While Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> requires that an eligible person be on a trajectory toward death, the flexibility purposefully built into the bill's criteria would allow medical practitioners to respond to a wide variety of medical circumstances, not just predictable diseases that are subject to fixed prognoses of life left to live. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4394077">Indeed, unlike some U.S. state regimes that require a specific prognosis, Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> does not require a strict relationship between the medical condition and the cause of the person's reasonably foreseeable death.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394078">I do not agree with those who say that the Carter decision means that Parliament is constitutionally mandated to enact one of, if not the broadest, assisted dying regimes in the world, and that Parliament has little scope to consider other societal interests aside from autonomy. The court acknowledged that medically assisted death involved complex issues of social policy in a number of competing interests. In matters of this nature, the charter analysis takes into account the fact that there is no single manifestly correct balance of competing interests that are engaged. Deference will be shown, provided that Parliament's solution falls within the range of reasonable alternatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394079">Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> is reasonable. It would provide people who are in a path towards death a choice that would respect their wish to die with dignity. Equally, it would limit medical assistance in dying to persons in these types of circumstances in order to prevent the normalization of suicide, protect vulnerable persons who were disproportionately at risk of inducement to suicide, and affirm the equal value of every person's life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394080">This balancing of interests addresses the inherent risks associated with permitting medical assistance in dying, and represents what the trial judge in Carter described as a “carefully- designed system imposing stringent limits that were scrupulously monitored and enforced”. Such a system is necessary because the suffering that can lead someone to request assisted dying does not just come from the condition; it also comes from how our society too often treats people with such conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394081">Under an approach where any serious medical condition is eligible, the law would be saying that an assisted death could be an acceptable treatment for a soldier with post traumatic stress disorder, a young person who suffered a spinal cord injury in an accident, or a survivor whose mind was haunted by memories of sexual abuse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394082">These are difficult but necessary situations to talk about, because cases like these are the unavoidable consequence of an assisted dying law where the only limit on eligibility is an individual's subjective experience of suffering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394083">As both the justice and human rights committee and the senate committee heard from several witnesses, the risk to vulnerable people, as well the crucial objectives of suicide prevention and affirming the value of the lives of all Canadians could be greatly increased unless eligibility was limited to persons who were approaching the end of their lives.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="30">(1030)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4394084">As I said, when Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> was introduced, assisted dying is a matter that touches us all and challenges us all. Divergent views on the bill remain, but we have a responsibility to act for all Canadians. The interim court approval process ends on June 6. If there is no legislation in place at that time, medical assistance in dying will lack a legal framework outside of the province of Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394085">There is even uncertainty as to whether the court's remedy in Carter, if it came into force on June 6 in place of a statutory regime, would have the legal effect of completely striking down the existing criminal law that prohibits consensual killings and the aiding of suicides outside of an assisted dying context.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394086">While most medical regulators have published interim guidelines, there would be no mandatory or consistent national safeguards. It could be possible, for example, for a physician to end a mature minor's life, depending on the province. Different jurisdictions require different numbers of witnesses, and some provide no waiting period at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394087">Uncertainty around Carter parameters would persist and likely lead to inconsistent results in who would be found to be eligible, even between medical practitioners in the same jurisdictions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394088">We have a choice: To have a statutory framework in place with all of the national-level safeguards and protections that I have described, or having none. Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> reflects the kind of society we should aspire to be, one that respects individual autonomy and one that affirms that the lives of all Canadians have inherent value and are equally entitled to the protection of the law.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4394122">We have also heard that 84% of Canadians want this. However, that statement that we have often heard is a little misleading, because 84% of Canadians do support this under certain criteria, and that criteria is that the illness is terminal, and the person is suffering terribly and repeatedly asks to have assisted suicide to end their suffering. Therefore, it is important to remember that it is under certain conditions.</ParaText>

Actually, we have had more of a response to this issue through emails, phone calls, letters, and responses to the householder. We have had more responses on this than on any other issue in the last 12 and a half years that I have been a member of Parliament. People are very engaged and understand what the issues are and the challenges that the House faces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394125">Again, I thank the <Affiliation DbId="214321" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation>, but as a critique, I think the government could have approached this a little differently, instead of dominating the committee structures, instead of bringing in time allocation, and instead of saying no to all the amendments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394126">The minister spoke about the 16 amendments, which, of course, were Liberal amendments. Of the amendments, there was one that the Conservative Party and the NDP at committee agreed with, and that was on conscience protection. We asked that all physicians, health care professionals, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, or anybody who is a health care professional who does not want to be involved with this have the right to say no. However, the government turned down that amendment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394127">The fact is, the parliamentary secretaries in the committee talked to each of the members on that committee and told them that the Liberals were not going to support that. Then the parliamentary secretary of justice actually spoke at the committee and said that the government did not support amending like that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394128">As the <Affiliation DbId="214321" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> just said, the government is going to leave it to negotiating with the provinces, and download that responsibility to the provinces. However, what we are doing in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> is amending the Criminal Code of Canada. Prior to the Carter decision, it was illegal to assist anybody in a suicide. It was legal to commit suicide but illegal to assist somebody. It was considered homicide if someone assisted somebody. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="50">(1050)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4394129">Under the Carter decision a physician can, under certain conditions, provide assistance in a suicide and euthanasia. That amendment to the Criminal Code also could be elaborated on to say that it would be a criminal offence to force health care professionals or any individuals through coercion or intimidation, to participate in the death of another individual against their will. That is what we suggested. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394130">When Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> gets referred to the Senate it will have to deal with it. I believe the Senate will refer this legislation back to the House. It is going to refuse to accept Bill C-14 the way it is and it will provide proper conscience protection for physicians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394131">We heard from the Canadian Medical Association that 70% of physicians in Canada do not want to be a part of this. They do not want to be forced through coercion, intimidation, or threats that they will no longer be able to practise at this or that hospital if they do not participate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394132">In a <I>National Post</I> article called “'Killing' patients vs. 'doing their job': Sharp division of opinion on whether doctors should be required to assist in suicide”, a doctor says she has been practising medicine for 37 years. The family doctor has decided not to renew her medical licence in June of this year. Dr. Naylor has no desire to quit medicine but she says she is appalled at the thought of being forced to refer. Dr. Burke, who practises physical medicine and rehabilitation in Windsor Ontario, said he is renewing his medical licence in Michigan where assisted suicide is illegal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394133">I have heard this at town hall meetings across the country and at the two I had in my own community. A young medical student asked me if physicians were going to be forced to do this and I said that there is a good possibility because in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> the government is leaving it up to the provinces. We have already heard that the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario will require physicians to effectively refer, which means that a doctor must follow that person through the whole process to make sure he or she does get euthanized if that is what the individual requested. The doctor must participate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394134">Physicians across this country, like those I just mentioned, are going to refuse to participate, saying they are now of retirement age and will retire or will relocate to another jurisdiction where they will not be forced to be a part of this, which goes against their conscience. A shortage of physicians and nurses will create a medical emergency in Canada. We will have a shortage of physicians and nurses in Canada because they will be forced to participate in something that goes against their conscience.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394135">The government has an opportunity to do the right thing. It refused to do it in the House so it will be left to the Senate. The Senate will decide and it will amend Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. It will come back to the House in an amended form. We do not know how long that will take but it is obvious that the June 6 deadline will not be met. I hope the government will play differently then and will co-operate with the Senate and not strike down its amendments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394136">It is better to have Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> than nothing but it does need to be amended. The government needs to be more open-minded and congenial and work within this parliamentary environment and come up with legislation that represents where Canadians are at on this issue, not where the government is at.</ParaText>

It said that it will be the Carter decision and that it will be applied differently across Canada. In each province it will be the College of Physicians and Surgeons that will determine that. In Ontario, it will be required by physicians whereas in some provinces it will not be. In some provinces the provincial government will be engaged and in others it may not. Therefore, we will have a hodgepodge of how this will be applied across Canada. That is not in the interests of Canadians. Therefore, we need to pass this. Legislation is required. The problem is that Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> needs to be amended. It has some big holes in it.

This is not a matter that I take lightly, the issue of life or death.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394154">Over the last few months, I have had the opportunity to speak with constituents in my riding. I have read the letters and emails they have written in. I have consulted with spiritual leaders from many faiths in the communities within my riding. I have sat through every single minute of this debate, because the magnitude of the legislation is something that deserves our thoughtful consideration. It is also something that has been weighing heavily on me, because regardless of my personal beliefs, I represent the tens of thousands of friends and families in the beautiful riding of Cariboo—Prince George.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394155"> For years I have worked toward my dream of becoming a member of Parliament, because I knew this opportunity would afford me the chance to make a difference, to be part of meaningful change, and to leave our country better for generations to come, but nothing truly prepares one to vote on a piece of legislation of this magnitude. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394156">I am at the age and the point in my life where, unfortunately, I have seen my fair share of human suffering. It is a true test of humans to watch a loved one, a friend, or even a stranger, who is faced with intolerable suffering with no hope of recovery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394157">It is a reality that physician-assisted suicide will indeed become law. This we know is true. In 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada issued a landmark ruling in Carter v. Canada, stating that the laws preventing Kay Carter from ending her life in Canada were contrary to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394158">Kay Carter was a schoolteacher, a wife, and a mother. She was suffering from severe spinal stenosis, a disease that was making it impossible for her to move her body. She was 89, and because medical assistance in dying was illegal in Canada, Carter and her family travelled to a Swiss medical clinic, where she chose to end her life in 2010. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394159">It is not in dispute that Carter was faced with intolerable suffering, but Carter's family and their lawyer have publicly stated that they believe that Kay Carter would have been ineligible for medical assistance in dying under Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. Therefore, my question for my colleagues across the floor is this. If this legislation was built to address the decision of Carter v. Canada, then why would it likely exclude the very case that opened the door for physician-assisted suicide in our country?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394160">Many have expressed their concerns that this legislation is unconstitutional. Benoît Pelletier, a professor from the University of Ottawa, appeared before the special committee tasked with studying assisted suicide.

Beyond legal implications, the opposition to Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> crosses party lines. We have heard from Conservative, Liberal, and NDP members, as well as concerned senators, multiple witnesses, and organizations such as the B.C. Civil Liberties Association, the Alberta Court of Appeal, and the Canadian Bar Association. At the core of our democracy is the ability to have thoughtful debate and discussion on a wide range of issues. Some of these issues are easier to address than others. Sometimes there is a unanimous consensus, and sometimes there is not. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394163">We need to acknowledge in cases where there is not consensus that more work needs to be done, amendments need to be considered, and a majority control of the House should not be used to thwart dissenting opinions, especially on an issue of this scope and magnitude. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4394164">Dealing with the sanctity of life and death should be cause for more consultation, more discussion, and more debate than that over a pipeline or a budget. We have debated this for approximately 20 hours. Over half of the Conservative caucus has not had the opportunity to debate this subject. Even more of my Liberal colleagues have not had the opportunity to speak on this. It is concerning to me that on a piece of legislation of this magnitude, my Liberal colleagues have not had the opportunity to speak on this. It would appear from the outset that perhaps the Liberal backbenches are, indeed, being muzzled on this important piece of legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394165">Quebec took six years in successive legislative assemblies to develop its physician-assisted suicide law, six years of consultations and commitment to ensure its bill was not just good enough but one that captured most, if not all, concerns and safeguards. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4394167">The Liberal government should allow all members to speak on behalf of their constituents and engage in further necessary consultations in order to get the legislation right, because the alternative is passing a deeply flawed and in my opinion unconstitutional piece of legislation. Passing Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> in this manner will result in court challenges that will further deadlock the work of the House and parliamentarians in having a workable document that protects the most vulnerable members of society from abuse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394168">The debate on assisted suicide over the last few months has opened the door to some of the alternatives that also need to be considered when speaking about Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. Palliative care is a critical component of this issue. We must always ensure that a proper palliative care strategy is in place. While the government likes to talk about this being core and an important piece in its budget and in moving forward, it has not even been mentioned once in the most current budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394169">To ensure that individuals are well informed about their end-of-life options not only physically but to deal with their emotions, palliative care needs to be a viable end-of-life choice. At a time when assisted dying is a hotly contested issue, it is important to engage in conversations around palliative care to ensure that people are making the best decisions to improve their quality of life. We need to protect our most vulnerable.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4394192">Four months ago, I walked into the first meeting of a special House and Senate committee, created to advise the government on its response to the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in the Carter case. We worked long hours and late nights, respectfully and constructively with all parties and involving both chambers. We heard from witnesses and experts from across Canada and from all walks of life. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394193">As we worked, I know that many of us thought of those who had struggled and suffered for the right to control their own lives at the end: people like Sue Rodriguez, who died in 1994 after losing her battle with ALS and losing her battle in the Supreme Court of Canada a year before. I recognized important contributors like Svend Robinson, member of Parliament, in that earlier battle. I think of people like Kay and Lee Carter, Hollis Johnson, William Shoichet, and Gloria Taylor, who fought valiantly and won in the court last year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394194">The work of the Special Joint Committee on Physician-Assisted Dying proved that a thoughtful and respectful debate was possible, but more than that it proved that a well-crafted bill could win the support of all parties and members of both Houses. I say that because a broad majority of us from all parties and both chambers agreed on 21 recommendations to the current government. I never imagined that I would be standing here now to oppose this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394195">This government bill ignores or rejects the majority of recommendations of that joint House and Senate committee. I am proud of those recommendations. It is true that many would have required great political courage, but all of them faithfully followed the evidence we received from the majority of experts who appeared before us. For example, I sought to have advance requests accepted by people who may lose the ability to provide competent consent at the end. The vast majority of Canadians told us that they want that. However, not only does this bill reject those recommendations, the bill would defy the Supreme Court ruling, fall short of its requirements, and therefore would violate the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for suffering Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394196">That is the opinion of the Canadian Bar Association, the Barreau du Québec, and many others. That was the ruling of the Alberta Court of Appeal a couple of weeks ago, and just days ago, a court in Ontario echoed the Alberta decision. Justice Paul Perell of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice ruled that the Supreme Court's basis for an assisted death “is the threat the medical condition poses to a person's life and its interference with the quality of that person's life”. He went on to say, “There is no requirement...that a medical condition be terminal or life threatening.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394197">Despite this, time and again the current government has limited debate and tried to strong-arm a flawed bill through this chamber.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394198">To be sure, this is a complex and sensitive issue, but not a partisan one. The Supreme Court has given us as parliamentarians an opportunity, not an ultimatum, to craft legislation that is consistent with the Carter decision. As is so often the case in this debate, we ought to look at exactly what the court said. Here is what they said, in paragraph 126 of the decision: “It is for Parliament and the provincial legislatures to respond, should they so choose, by enacting legislation consistent with the constitutional parameters set out in these reasons.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394199">Today the <Affiliation DbId="214321" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> again suggested that the court instructed us to enact a bill by a particular date. The court said the opposite. Each of us as parliamentarians, facing a free vote, has a simple question to answer: Does this bill obey the constitutional parameters set out by the Supreme Court in Carter? In my submission, that is the only question. If it does not, if it fails that test, then this House is being asked to knowingly infringe the charter rights of suffering Canadians and to enshrine that violation in law.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4394200">The Supreme Court of Canada established that all adult competent Canadians suffering intolerably from a grievous and irremediable medical condition have the right to choose assistance in dying. The government would have us honour that right only for patients nearing the end of life. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394201">The Canadian Bar Association has said that such a restriction does not meet the floor of rights established by the court.

              <ParaText id="4394202">I suggested removing this line to help the bill comply with the court and the charter, but that idea was rejected by the Liberal majority. Now the Alberta Court of Appeal has ruled unanimously that the government's interpretation of Carter is simply wrong. In a crucial decision that the court wrote a couple of weeks ago, it said:</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394204">This is a devastating indictment of the very argument that the government has relied upon to defend Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> against this rising chorus of critics. Surely that ruling should give us all pause. However, still some will argue that the Supreme Court cannot be obeyed right away, that medical reality dictates a balanced approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394205">The government's restrictions have raised eyebrows in the medical community as well. The federation representing every medical regulatory authority in Canada has called this bill's end-to-life requirement “too vague to be understood or applied by the medical profession and too ambiguous to be regulated effectively”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394206">The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario called it inconsistent with Carter and likely to cause confusion among physicians. The Canadian Nurses Association suggested going back to the words of the Supreme Court, as I have done in this place. If that were done, this controversial line could simply be deleted. I proposed doing exactly that, and my amendments were rejected by the Liberal majority on the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394207">Not only are medical groups concerned about the bill, many were not even consulted. According to testimony in the Senate, neither the Federation of Medical Regulatory Authorities of Canada nor any of the provincial or territorial colleges were consulted in the drafting of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394208">We have a bill in which a few key lines have drawn heavy fire from both the legal and medical communities. These lines could be written on a napkin. They could easily be deleted, as my amendments would have done, and replaced with the exact words of our Supreme Court. Who could resist and oppose that in good faith? However, the government has refused precisely to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394209">On the first day of committee hearings, a Liberal member asked the <Affiliation DbId="214321" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> a simple question: “Have we sought outside counsel to ensure charter compliance of this bill?” The minister chose not to answer, citing only her personal confidence in the bill. Clearly, no independent confirmation of its charter compliance has been found.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394210">I appreciate what the minister told this House recently, that no one has a monopoly on interpreting the charter. Of course, the minister is right, but I am afraid that the outlier here is not the critics; it is the government. The Canadian and Quebec bar associations, eminent legal and medical experts, the lead counsel in Carter, all are saying that the bill does not obey the Supreme Court of Canada's ruling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394211">Against that array, the government stands almost alone, brandishing a backgrounder from the Department of Justice and refusing to refer the question to the Supreme Court, or even to obtain an independent legal opinion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394212">Now the Alberta Court of Appeal has unanimously rejected the government's argument that the Supreme Court limited its ruling to end-of-life patients. Let me repeat: A provincial court of appeal has already ruled that the government's narrow and selective reading of Carter, the legal argument that supports this bill, is not consistent with the Supreme Court's ruling and therefore infringes a patient's charter rights.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4394213">Now we are being asked to enshrine that violation in law, and with what justification? No argument has been made for the bill's compliance with Carter and the charter. The minister is right that Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>'s many critics cannot simply assert that the bill is not constitutional, but neither can the government simply assert that it is. No one can claim to know the inner thoughts of our Supreme Court justices, but neither can the government continue to suggest that the intention of their ruling is somehow opaque or unknowable. The ruling was not an ink blot test, it was quite clear. The court was looking at the law with the same objective as the bill, to protect specific vulnerable individuals suffering during moments of weakness. The court found that the previous ban was overbroad because it caught people outside of that class, competent people who were not vulnerable and therefore deserved to have their autonomy respected. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394214">That would remain true under Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. An entire class of competent adult Canadians would be condemned to intolerable suffering and denied recourse to assistance in dying. They may be forced to end their lives prematurely or violently. These are the same violations of section 7 rights identified already by the court in Carter. Although the court in Carter did not choose to proceed to an analysis of a section 15 infringement, the equality rights provision, the trial judge did. She concluded that the prohibition “imposed a disproportionate burden on persons with physical disabilities, as only they are restricted to self-imposed starvation and dehydration in order to take their own lives”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394215">As Quebec's minister of health warned us when he spoke out against the bill, this is precisely the same cruel option that will soon face patients if Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>'s end-of-life clause is not deleted. It is shameful that the bill leaves suffering Canadians in that cruel position.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394216">At committee, I pressed the Department of Justice on this point. I told them the story of Tony Nicklinson. This story comes from an affidavit filed in the Carter case. During a business trip to Athens, Mr. Nicklinson suffered a severe stroke that caused what is called locked-in syndrome. In this state, he could not move a single muscle of his body except his eyelids. His healthy active mind was trapped in an unresponsive body, without remedy, without hope, and perhaps for decades more. He said he could not even drink and smoke in the hopes of shortening his life. Mr. Nicklinson wrote this in an affidavit, one blink at a time. He told the court this:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4394222"> This is what we are talking about when we say that the bill infringes on the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for Canadians. Quebec's minister of health warned the government that the bill would force competent, consenting patients to endure starvation to win from the current government the rights that were already granted to them in the Carter case. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394223">The court found the previous ban unconstitutional, not only because it violated the rights of competent patients but also because it was unnecessary. A better system was possible. Vulnerability, it said, could be assessed on an individual basis, and well-designed safeguards are capable of protecting the vulnerable. With these facts, the court could see no justification for continuing to deny the autonomy of whole classes of competent patients, like Mr. Nicklinson. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394224">There is still no justification. In fact, the last refuge for the government would be to accept what is now clear, that Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> does not meet the test of the Supreme Court, and to argue that somehow it is necessary to violate the charter or even wise, because the safeguards the Liberals have developed are too weak to handle more complex cases. The bill is flawed, and I cannot accept that argument.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394225">I was proud to serve on the joint House-Senate committee that offered recommendations to the government before the drafting of Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. We studied best practices around the world and recommended many of the robust safeguards found in the bill. Above all, I have great confidence in the care and professionalism of Canadian medical practitioners, and so I cannot accept that the Supreme Court was wrong in saying that well-designed safeguards can protect vulnerable people. I cannot accept that this regime is so weak—or Canadian doctors so careless—that it cannot be trusted to faithfully uphold the full charter rights of patients and to filter out those who are not able to make this choice. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394226">Therefore, I am left with a simple conclusion. Enacting the bill would revoke from an entire class of competent and suffering adult Canadians the rights established for them by the Supreme Court. It would do so in a manner that is neither medically necessary nor legally justified.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394227">I have sought to amend the bill and have seen those solutions rejected. I have requested independent constitutional analysis, and found none. I have called on the government to refer it to the Supreme Court of Canada, and it has not. Now I cannot, as a lawyer and a parliamentarian, support the enactment of a law that I believe would be unconstitutional from the outset. To vote for Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, against the charter rights of suffering patients—and I know some of them by name—I cannot do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394228">The government may try to excuse the bill's imperfections as inevitable in the circumstances, and I know there are members here who recognize that the bill is flawed but have been told they simply have to pass it by June 6. </ParaText>

The absolute ban on medically assisted dying will not be restored, nor will the offences that prevented it, such as aiding suicide, disappear from the code. In other words, crime will not become legal, nor will medical assistance in dying become illegal. Rather, an exemption will open for patients and physicians acting within the parameters of the Carter decision. Of course, every provincial regulator has made rules to deal with safeguards over the last year anyway. They are ready to go.

It is rare in the House, although we all like to speak out, that we hear a member basically pull apart the government's arguments on assisted dying and put forward, as the member for Victoria has, the real reasons the government has so badly botched what should have been a non-partisan approach to the bill, which should have involved all members of Parliament. Instead, the government has been so clearly partisan that it has risked the actual objective of the bill to accomplish some sort of legislative framework and risked having it put in place.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4394274">The framework laid out in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> provides a solid, focused and detailed plan, which will meet the June 6 deadline set out by the court. Let me explain why.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394275">Permitting medical assistance in dying will extend more control to eligible terminally ill patients on how to live out their last days. This legislation also provides important safeguards and limitations. It requires the <Affiliation DbId="214328" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="214321" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation>, in consultation with the provinces, to create regulations that will protect all of those involved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394276">By permitting medical assistance in dying for competent adults, whose deaths are reasonably foreseeable, I believe we are striking the right balance between the patients' autonomy who seek this medical assistance and the interests of patients in need of protection.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394277"> It is important to note that this bill does not stand alone. I would point out the critical work of improving palliative care in this country. The ideas of medical assistance in dying and a strong palliative care system are not in conflict. Rather, the two are complementary and are both important issues to address. That is why I am proud that the <Affiliation DbId="214328" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> has recommitted to home care and palliative care improvements in response to a question that I asked during question period on May 2. In her reply to my question, the minister quoted Dr. Atul Gawande, who talked about how people want not only a good death but a good life to the very end. The minister reiterated her commitment to palliative care and providing dignity when Canadians are suffering. She announced how she will work with the provinces to ensure the high quality care of all Canadians. She also brought up how the Government of Canada is committed to an investment of $3 billion over four years to support that goal of palliative care and home care improvements. I commend this step forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394278">We cannot view assisted dying legislation separate from investments in our health care system. Quality palliative care is a critical priority of this government. Indeed, as our government renegotiates the health accord with the provinces, I look forward to seeing palliative care discussed. The work with the provinces, territories, and stakeholders is essential to providing options to end-of-life care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394279"> My background is as a research coordinator and diabetes educator. I know how the roles and views of physicians and nurse practitioners are vital to this issue. As a member of the health committee, and someone who worked in the health care field for almost 20 years, I understand the importance of consulting the people on the front lines. Physicians and nurse practitioners are central to the end-of-life process. Their conscience rights will be respected in this legislation. We are working on the best way to ensure their views are always taken into account.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4394280">The rules in this legislation are clear and eligibility has been carefully defined. I want to be clear. There is nothing in the legislation that would compel any medical practitioner or authorized nurse practitioner to provide medical assistance in dying. The legislation is meant to balance access to medical assistance in dying while respecting the personal convictions of health care providers. This is about finding the right balance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394281">Canadians are looking to their doctors and nurses to provide health care and to help them maintain their quality of life. However, when the quality is no longer attainable, Canadians want to know that their health care providers will also help them when their choice is a dignified end to their lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394282">We have struck the right balance in my view by having proper procedural safeguards. Access to medical assistance in dying would only be available to those who meet the following conditions: be a mentally competent adult who is at an advanced state of irreversible decline in capability; have a serious and incurable illness, disease, or disability; experience enduring and intolerable suffering; and whose death is reasonably foreseeable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394283">It will also remain a crime to assist a person either in dying or in causing a person's death in a situation other than lawful medical assistance in dying. Protective measures are a key part of the legislation to ensure that eligible patients have given informed consent. Patients have to make a written request for medical assistance in dying and have it signed by two independent witnesses. Two independent medical opinions have to confirm that the patient meets all the criteria. These first two criteria are intended to ensure that requests for medical assistance in dying are truly voluntary, that they reflect the wishes of the patient, and are not made as a result of external pressure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394284">Our evidence-based approach will include regulating, monitoring, and reporting. This monitoring and reporting system will also be able to signal any issues or unexpected consequences. We want Canadians to see a system that is functioning and preventing abuses or errors. This will build up confidence and allow Canadians to make informed decisions about how the system should operate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394285">I appreciate how other members have spoken about how we will look to international models in terms of ways to work with the provinces and territories. This end-of-life coordination system will respect the role of the provinces, while providing access and respecting peoples' rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394286">I want to recognize the work of the committees and the senators who have studied this matter and made recommendations around this debate. These recommendations and testimony from those on all sides of this issue should be taken into account. There have been a number of informative and heartfelt speeches by fellow members who I also want to take a moment to applaud. I also thank the <Affiliation DbId="214321" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="214328" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> for their work in introducing the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394287">Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> strikes a proper balance in view of the Supreme Court of Canada's decision and provides a needed legal framework. As parliamentarians we have the final say on behalf of the people we serve who elected us to be their voice. This is a debate that engages our morality, our sense of justice, and our compassion. It asks tough questions of our legal and medical systems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394288">We have talked to one another and heard some touching stories. We have reflected on how this issue affects all of us. It has called on us to hear the stories coming from the prospective Canadians who are suffering. It is often all too easy to forget what we would do if we were in their shoes. We often fail to truly appreciate the perspective and experience of those diagnosed with a terminal illness. Their dignity is challenged more and more as they reach their end. </ParaText>

The people of Brampton South elected me to be their voice here, to bring a different approach, and to implement our government's better plan. Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> is the right bill at the right time. It is the best approach. We need checks and balances. That is why the committee did a great job. Even the CMA said that. The Canadian Medical Association has pointed out that in the Carter decision, the “...parameters are vague in the extreme, and contain absolutely no clinical direction whatsoever”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394296">The term “grievous and irremediable” which is used by the court is not a medical term, so we need more clarification for that. That is why the committee did great work. We listened to all the consultations and this is the right bill. We have listened to all Canadians, and this is the right bill that we have to bring.</ParaText>

She committed in this House, in response to the question I asked on May 2, to invest in palliative care. As part of a multi-year health accord, the federal government has committed to providing $3 billion over the next four years to improve home care, including palliative care. The minister is working with the provinces and territories. Palliative care is more about dignity while dying from natural causes. That is the right plan. Our health minister is very keen to implement that, and that is what we are doing. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4394300">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to have this opportunity to speak to this legislation and enter this debate. First, I want to thank the leadership of all the parties for making this a free vote. This is such an emotional, difficult, and personal debate. Having had the opportunity to sit in the House since the eighties, I have had the opportunity to be involved in many debates. From my experience, this is one of the most difficult debates that as a parliamentarian I have entered into.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394301">I want to be clear, as we start this discussion, that I support the legislation, and I will lay out to some extent the reason why I feel this way. This decision has to be based on our own personal life experiences and some would say, our own values. However, the reality is that all members in this place come from different parts of Canada, come from different experiences, and have different understandings in some respects of what we are entering into.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394302">We all have to keep this in mind. This is fundamental societal change. This is fundamental because we are moving to allow individual Canadians, people who we love, who we are close to, who are our neighbours, our friends, the ability to have medical assisted dying. It should be one of those debates that should not be taken lightly. Nor should it be a debate where we talk specifically about what the lawyers or the courts are saying. Yes, we have a court case to deal with and the Supreme Court has told us what its sense is, that in fact people have a right to assisted dying. However, we should not diminish the importance of what that may do to our country over the long term.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394303">I want to use my experience as a member of Parliament to explain the rationale for being extremely careful and diligent in our decisions as we move forward over the next number of years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394304"> I represent a riding that probably has the most suicides of anywhere in Canada. Over the last decade, I have watched hundreds of young people take their lives, people who I know their families, their moms and dads, and have watched with some horror as they have made that kind of decision. Yes, it is a little different than what we are debating today, but it defines how we feel about the objective of allowing people to make that ultimate decision of taking their own life with the medical assistance of others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394305">We should in some regard be careful not to assume what is being said by others in the House, for example, that the legislation does not go far enough, or that it may be not charter compliant because it is too restrictive, or that it goes too far for some people who have made equally compassionate arguments in the House. This decision has to be based on where we think we want our society to go. It is not up to the courts to define and to suggest, as some have suggested even today, that we have not gone far enough so therefore we have to go all the way to a particular place because it may not potentially be compliant with the charter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394306">I sat in cabinet for a number of years and I have seen many legal arguments put to cabinet on different issues by legal counsel and on many occasions. On many occasions I have had the opportunity to see the decision made right or the decision made wrong, or the advice to be given not exactly as we had anticipated. Therefore, we cannot stand in this place and assure Canadians that this legislation is absolutely perfect one way or the other.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="05">(1205)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4394307">That is why I like the approach the government has taken. It has taken an approach that it is very restrictive. It gives society time to look at the other areas that we may consider, as parliamentarians, to allow people to take their own life, for example, minors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394308">As I said, I have had the experience of watching many young children take their lives. To talk about minors who are willing to take their lives and make it legal and easier, if I could put it in those terms, is not something I totally support. I am very concerned about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394309">I am worried about the whole issue of advance requests. It is hard to predict the situation a person will find themselves in, so we need to have more study of the whole issue of advance requests, and minors and mental illness. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394310">I support the legislation, not because the leadership told me to do it. I do not tend to work that way and never have. I think it is the best approach for something that would fundamentally change our society forever. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394311">We have to remind ourselves as we stand here, and when we vote tonight, that someone close to us very soon will use this legislation. It may not be as comfortable and as simple as some people have made it sound. We have had this discussion today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394312">The legal framework is important. It is important for the Senate not to get into this discussion about whether or not it goes far enough. The reality of it is that if it is a framework that allows us to get the compliance we need through the charter, we should move forward on it. I want to make this clear. I do not care which legislation we would pass, the one the NDP seems to favour or the one the Conservatives seem to want to have, and I am not sure exactly which way that would go. That legislation will go to the Supreme Court to be tested as we move forward. It does not matter which legislation we pass because this is such a fundamental change to our society, there is no doubt people will go to the Supreme Court to test the reality of the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394313">Here is the reality we face. Under the legislation, we allow mentally competent adults who are in an advanced state of irreversible decline in capability, have a serious and incurable illness, disease or disability and are experience enduring and intolerable suffering caused by their medical condition, and whose death has become reasonably foreseeable, taking into account all of their medical circumstances, to seek assisted dying. That is a pretty large amount to start with. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394314">I know this will change our health care system for the next generations. I strongly recommend to members of Parliament not to be too quick to judge what other generations will want to have 50, 100 years from now. We should be very careful about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394315">I believe, as most Liberals do, in individual rights. I am not suggesting we restrict those, but the right to choose for people who are competent is fair. Having control and obviously the dignity in dying are very important concepts for me as a member of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394316">Today I am pleased to have this opportunity to make these comments. This is not a partisan issue. This will not get any member of Parliament more votes, one way or the other. This is a profound fundamental change in how I will deal with individuals every day with whom I am close. I want to ensure we get it right. If we did restrict it too much this time, I would rather do that than go too far.</ParaText>

They would not want those under the age of 18, who might feel depressed or have mental issues, to access assisted dying. As far as vulnerable people, how we confirm their capacity to consent is another concern. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394319">In the last part of the member's speech, he said that he was a Liberal and that he believed in individual rights.

              <ParaText id="4394322">Madam Speaker, my colleague has asked a good question. It goes back to my original discussion that we should go slowly and take our time. We should not just let the Supreme Court, or courts, decide what Parliament should decide. We have to make decisions in this place based on what is good for Canadians, in accordance with their beliefs and values. They will be interpreted in the courts, as will this legislation. If in fact, as the member has suggested, we do not allow for conscience rights for members of the medical profession to not participate and if this is considered to be unacceptable to the courts, we will hear that, and we will have further debates.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394323">I have been in this place for 17 years, and my colleague has been here quite a long time himself.

I think that is where our views diverge somewhat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394326">Furthermore, at the end of his speech, the other point that struck me is when he said that, no matter which legislation we pass, whether it is an NDP, Conservative, or Liberal bill, it will face a court challenge.</ParaText>

I believe in the sanctity of life, and I believe that all life, from conception right through to natural death, has value, has worth, and has purpose. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394335">As a sitting member of the committee for justice and human rights, I spent several weeks together with the committee in significant and lengthy meetings examining Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. We spent long days listening to witness testimony from experts and organizations from all over the country, and then doing a clause-by-clause analysis of the bill. Despite the many concerns voiced again and again by witnesses, there were no meaningful amendments made to the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394336">Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> is called medical assistance in dying, but make no mistake, Bill C-14 is physician-assisted suicide. It is important that we make this distinction. The gravity of the bill should not be undermined by the colourful wording. The bill would change Canada forever, and it would be naive to think that Canada's most vulnerable people would not be at risk under the bill in its present state. This is the most significant social re-engineering bill in the past 25 years, because it changes how we view the sanctity of life. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394337">The Supreme Court was very clear that physician-assisted suicide is not a charter right, but it is an exemption that could be provided on an exception basis providing individuals meet certain criteria. The person must be a competent adult who clearly consents to the termination of life, who has a grievous and irremediable medical condition, including an illness, disease, or disability that causes enduring suffering that is intolerable to the individual in the circumstances of his or her condition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394338">Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> clearly goes beyond the Supreme Court decision with a mandate to study making physician-assisted suicide available to mature minors, exploring the concept of advance directives, and providing physician-assisted suicide to mentally disabled individuals. This is just not acceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394339">The committee heard testimony from approximately 42 individuals and/or groups who all have a vested interest in this issue. Over 100 amendments were presented to committee based on evidence from witness testimony provided to committee. Sadly, the Liberals did not present any substantive amendments, and in fact, voted against any meaningful amendments presented by any of the opposition parties. The Conservatives presented many thoughtful amendments that would have strengthened the bill and added important safeguards, as they did last night at report stage. This is a missed opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394340">Let me highlight just a few of these missed amendments, these missed opportunities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394341">These amendments included things like assuring that only trained and qualified medical practitioners, in other words physicians, would assess the individual and administer the lethal cocktail that would eventually procure death. The way the legislation is presently drafted, it would allow a person to obtain the lethal drug from pharmacists, take it home, self-administer, and procure their own death. This worries me, and it should worry every Canadian. Witnesses presented testimony that in other jurisdictions that permit this practice, 30% to 40% of prescriptions for death go unused. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394342">What happens to these unused drugs? What if the drugs fall into the wrong hands? What if the drugs were not administered properly? What if they did not take all of it and complications set in as a result? How can we be sure that the individuals were not at some point pressured into it? There are just way too many unanswered questions in the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394343">The bill would also make it near impossible for medical practitioners to monitor and report on subsequent events. Did the patient self-administer the drug or did the patient die from an illness? How do we ensure that we have the correct data to track euthanasia in Canada? These are valid concerns being voiced by Canadians, and it could have been addressed in the amendments that we proposed at committee.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4394344">The Liberals are unwilling to consider an amendment to ensure physician supervision during the procedure. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394345">In addition, Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> allows for nurse practitioners to provide medical assistance in dying. There are substantial differences between a medical practitioner and a nurse practitioner, including the length of time spent training and the ability to prescribe various narcotics, yet suddenly, in this bill, we are affording them the ability to assess an individual's eligibility for physician-assisted suicide and prescribe life-ending cocktails, which is in stark contrast to the typical expectations we have of nurse practitioners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394346">This goes too far and is another issue we sought to address in the bill. Again, this is a missed opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394347">We also provided an amendment that would have removed psychological suffering as an eligibility consideration for physician-assisted suicide. This, quite simply, leaves too much room for interpretation. Allowing for psychological suffering as an eligibility consideration is the start of a very slippery slope in terms of who can receive physician-assisted suicide and for what purpose.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394348">We also suggested that “reasonably foreseeable death”, as defined in the bill, would be replaced with imminent death or at least death expected within 30 days. We heard testimony from witnesses on either end of the spectrum raising various concerns about this wording. “Reasonably foreseeable” in one physician's eyes could be completely different in the eyes of another. This will certainly open the door to uncertainty among patients and practitioners, and will definitely lead to subsequent lawsuits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394349">To further strengthen safeguards, we proposed an amendment requiring that prior judicial review had occurred to ensure that all criteria for physician-assisted suicide eligibility had been met.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394350"> Dr. Will Johnston, chair of the Euthanasia Prevention Coalition of British Columbia, came to testify before committee. He said the following:</ParaText>

                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394352">Dr. Johnston brings forward a valuable consideration. Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> does not stipulate to what degree a patient should be examined nor does it require examination of the factors creating vulnerability for the patient.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394353"> In addition, we know that this is a complicated matter and difficult to address in legislation. Every individual and every disease presents a different set of challenges. Judicial oversight would ensure that individuals meet all the criteria given their unique set of circumstances and would further protect Canada's most vulnerable people. Again, this very reasonable amendment was rejected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394354"> We also put forward a request that palliative care consultation be included as a criterion for seeking physician-assisted death. Patients would be made aware of all options available to them and ensure palliative care options were understood, offered, and available.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394355"> We heard time and again in committee that access to palliative care is a problem in this country.

              <ParaText id="4394374">Madam Speaker, I rise somewhat concerned today that I am finally, for the first time, able to speak to Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. We are at third reading. This bill has been rammed through the House. The Liberals have brought in closure time and again with this bill. Every time it was debated, whether at second reading or report stage, I was not available, or the time was so constrained and the list of speakers of the members of Parliament was so long, that I could not get on the list. Finally, I am able to speak today to Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> to reflect my concerns and those of my constituents on this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394375">When closure is used in dealing with issues of conscience like we are dealing with today with respect to physician-assisted death or doctor-assisted suicide, whatever we want to call it, we need to take the time to have the debate. We need to have the discussion among parliamentarians and talk to the appropriate experts to ensure that we get this right. If the Liberals rush this bill through the legislative process in the House and if they try to do it in the Senate, I can guarantee that mistakes will be made and this bill will be facing court challenges in a relatively short period of time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394376">I also have to reflect what my friend from the riding of Provencher said today. It is extremely disappointing that so many reasonable amendments were presented by members of the opposition parties, and not one of them found their way into this bill at report stage last night. That truly is disappointing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394377">In my riding of Selkirk—Interlake—Eastman, the topic of physician-assisted suicide is divisive, as it is right across the country. The majority of constituents who have contacted my office have been opposed to this policy, on two fronts: first, many people have deeply held moral, ethical, and religious beliefs that are strongly against assisted suicide; and, second, many believe that the policy will be used prematurely to end the lives of those who have become a burden to their families, society, or the medical system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394378">It is important to note that the Liberals broke a key election promise to invest $3 billion into long term care, including palliative care. Access to palliative care is an essential part of end-of-life decision-making. There was unanimous agreement on the Special Joint Committee on Physician-Assisted Dying and among stakeholders, including the Canadian Medical Association, on the need for a pan-Canadian strategy on palliative care, with dedicated funding. This would be an important step forward for Canada. It is something that the Liberals have glossed over in favour of introducing this legislation in a very careless and expeditious manner. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394379">Many medical doctors, nurses, and health care professionals are conflicted with the ethical and moral conundrum that assisted suicide presents, as it runs counter to the modern adaptation of the Hippocratic oath.

Dying with dignity does not apply only to physician-assisted suicide. Expanding and improving palliative care services is by far the better public policy, and should be a priority of all health care providers across this country. I am recommitting to working with like-minded Canadians and policy-makers, and parliamentarians right here, who want to enhance palliative care in Manitoba and across the country.

              <ParaText id="4394411">In this postmodern world of ours, with its tendency at times toward a certain kind of what some might call libertarian relativism, we must continue to believe and affirm that there exist values that we can all agree are objectively good and worth protecting and promoting, values that should inform, motivate, and guide us both individually and collectively. Namely, we must subscribe to the imperative that we as human beings have a duty to support each other in our struggle in this fight for life, as some colleagues have put it, this struggle against the undeniable reality of our finite existence, our mortality. Every moment of life has value. This truth is to be asserted and upheld. This is the prevailing consensus, one that has become deeply rooted and entrenched in society over the course of history. It is also our best instinct. Many of my constituents fear that Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> would undermine this consensus, this instinct. I understand this fear. </ParaText>

When I hear anyone appear to frame the debate on medical assistance in dying as one of pure libertarian choice, I must admit that a little part of me shudders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394413">After much reflection, I do not believe that Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> would necessarily lead us down a path to an increasingly permissive and contagious attitude toward self-directed death.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4394427"> The bill may not be perfect, but I believe it would be a mistake to suggest that it leaves a wide-open field in medically assisted dying, a fear expressed to me by many thoughtful constituents committed in the highest degree to the protection of human life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394428">Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> would establish numerous criteria to be met before access to medically assisted dying could be granted. In addition to being 18 years of age, the person must have a grievous and irremediable medical condition that meets four distinct criteria: the illness, disease, or disability must be serious and incurable; the individual must be in an advanced state of irreversible decline; moreover, the illness must be causing enduring physical or psychological suffering that is intolerable; and natural death must be said to be reasonably foreseeable. In addition, the person must make a voluntary request that is free from external pressure and that is the result of informed consent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394429">The bill also includes a number of safeguards, and the individual must make a request in writing or through another reliable means. If the request is being signed by a proxy, that proxy must be at least 18 years of age and understand the nature of the request. The request must be made after the person has been informed that his or her natural death has become reasonably foreseeable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394430">The request must be signed and dated before two independent witnesses, and in turn, these witnesses must not consciously be beneficiaries, financial or in any other material way, of the individual making the request, and they must not be directly involved in providing personal care to the person making the request.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394431">Two medical practitioners must provide a written opinion confirming that the person meets the eligibility criteria, and these medical practitioners must be independent. For example, one cannot be a supervisor of the other or a mentor of the other.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394432">Crucially, the person must be informed that he or she has an opportunity to withdraw the request at any time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394433">All of this said, I am not at all convinced that medical assistance in dying is a serene and dignified phenomenon, even if often depicted in this way. I suspect that complications may arise. This is why it is crucial and to the government's credit that the bill allows for monitoring of medical assistance in dying through detailed reporting.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4394437">In this regard, I am heartened that, in addition to the government's existing commitment to do more to fund palliative care, the bill makes specific reference to this commitment.

              <ParaText id="4394456">He is imploring his father to fight to the very end, to rage against the dying of the light. I believe this stanza describes the very essence of western philosophy when it comes to dying. Simply put, do not accept death. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394457">However, life is terminal. The very definition of life is to die. A rock does not live, because a rock does not die. A tree lives, because a tree dies. A person lives, because he or she dies. So, am I going to die?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394458">This is the subject of an excellent Ted Talks by a first responder. It is about a paramedic who would often arrive at the scene of an accident only to find a victim whose injuries were so severe that he or she was not going to survive. These victims would inevitably look up to this paramedic and ask: “Am I going to die?” In those moments, he would always lie and say no. He did so because he thought that was the kind, caring thing to do. Then a few years ago, he arrived at the scene of a severe motorcycle accident to find a victim who again asked the same question. For some reason, he told the truth and said yes. The reaction was not what he expected. The victim showed calm, inner peace, wisdom, and acceptance. From that time forward, he always told the truth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394459">Dylan Thomas in his poem tells us “wise men at their end know dark is right”. Therefore, am I going to die? Yes. We are all going to die.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394460">Now we find ourselves discussing an issue that is foreign to many of us. With Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, we are trying to determine when it is acceptable to accept to die. That is to say, when it is acceptable to go gentle into that good night. This is essentially what we are debating with this bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394461">Some argue that the bill should follow the Supreme Court's ruling to the letter. Some argue that the bill should be broad to encompass all possible scenarios. Some argue that the bill should be narrow and restricted so as to protect the vulnerable. Some argue that there should be no bill at all, and we should not be on this path regardless of what the Supreme Court says.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394462">Here in the House we have had great debate on this matter. It has been passionate, intelligent, and respectful. It has been the House of Parliament at its best. For example, the member for <Affiliation DbId="213892" Type="2">St. Albert—Edmonton</Affiliation>, who was on the special joint committee that prepared the guiding report for this legislation, has spoken eloquently on why he believes this bill is missing certain key protections. On the other hand, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214384" Type="2">Victoria</Affiliation>, who was also on the special joint committee, has expressed, in a thoughtful, intelligent manner, his strong belief that the bill is too restrictive in certain areas. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394463">I have received numerous personal letters from many sides of this argument, letters from people who are suffering now and fear not being able to access this gentle path when their time comes. Other letters are from caregivers who look after the grievously sick, the aged, and the mentally incapacitated. They are deeply concerned that these vulnerable people will not be protected. My own father has written on this bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394464">I was out meeting constituents a few weeks ago and a lady came up to me. She said that she really liked what my father had written in the newspaper.

I asked to see it, if he could email it me. He said, “No, I've erased it”, because he does not like to keep clutter on his computer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394465">I asked him to explain the gist of what he said, and he went on to explain that the term “reasonably foreseeable natural death” was a difficult one, even for a physician. My father had suffered severe heart attacks 25 years ago and was told to put his affairs in order by his physician. </ParaText>

In my region, people are very concerned about palliative care. We have people who are working very hard in the field of palliative care in the greater Drummond region. For example, there is Maison René-Verrier, which provides wonderful palliative care. I know that palliative care is important to the Liberals, but unfortunately, there was nothing in the most recent budget in that regard. There is also nothing in this bill to indicate that the government is really going to focus on palliative care. I would like to hear my colleague's thoughts on that. </ParaText>

I urge you to write a law as restrictive as possible, and to respect and include the rights of many Canadians, who see any legalization of euthanasia and assisted suicide as murder. As a former health care worker for many years, I urge the government to invest more money in palliative care. I know from experience, pain can be controlled. They will receive passionate loving care and death will come naturally. Trusting that common sense will prevail in your good judgment.”</ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">“Hello Member of Parliament. I do not support this legislation, not because I do not firmly believe in a competent citizen's right to commit suicide at the end of life as determined solely and completely by that individual, but because C-14 does not go far enough. This bill certainly needs to be passed federally so a provincial regulatory ragtag patchwork does not evolve. As well, C-14 needs expansion in at least four areas: Enshrine my right to predetermine through a pre-arranged power of attorney for personal care that suicide is my wish if I become incapable of making that choice later on; in other words, similar to my legal right now to refuse treatment before treatment is ever needed. Enshrine my right to commit suicide on my own, without a doctor's direct assistance. This change will allow “medical practitioners” to merely prescribe requested and appropriate meds for this most personal action, not to have to do it themselves in an environment perhaps not of my own choosing. Following from number 2, ensure that a broad array of competently trained, caring “medical practitioners” beyond merely MDs are available to assist as I may desire; the so called “death doula” model. Ensure that the so-called mentally ill can benefit from the legislation if they are deemed competent to do so by due process, since by virtue of being labelled mentally ill, a person should not also be deemed mentally irrational or incompetent in all areas or aspects of life. This is very unlike children under 18 or the developmentally delayed however, who must be closely protected, at least by benefit of clear due process. At the same time, there is a clear need for those ethically opposed in both caring professions and institutions to be able to opt out because of their beliefs, but only insofar as they must also be compelled to refer me to those who are non-opposed. This should also hold true by the way, for abortion, legalized marijuana, and like matters. There is also a clear case for broadly based, publicly funded “palliative care” services for those who want this kind of assistance. At the end of one's life it must always be about informed and competent personal freedom of choice, whatever that choice may be. This is in fact the basis of all quality of life and death, as entrenched in our Canadian charter, as decided by our Supreme Court. A national referendum on the matter is unwise and not needed. Similarly, I refer you back to Conservative P.M. Mulroney's 1980s second election, which was a referendum/vote writ large on free trade. He won then, as did NAFTA. Therefore, I largely agree with the previous Pierre Trudeau's 1960s statement when he was Liberal justice minister: “The state has no right in the bedrooms of the nation”. I think that goes a bit too far. The state does have a "limited" right, but only to ensure vulnerable persons, as well as persons who may become vulnerable, are not exploited, and are always treated with dignity and respect. In this, the Dutch, Swiss and Oregon models serve well. Thank you; please do acknowledge this email and feel free to share your thoughts.”</QuotePara>

How about the disabled whom a lot of people believe are a burden to our society, the mentally ill, etc. Let us put money into our palliative care and hospices where people can die naturally.

What we suggest is that it be made legal for people to choose this option during the preparation of their will with family and/or doctor as witness to this wish. We have a mother in long-term care in Almonte and the number of people suffering from Alzheimer's disease far outnumber the people who are lucid. I am sure if these people had a choice it would be to end their lives rather than sit in wheelchairs all day and to be treated, through no fault of their own, like babies.

              <ParaText id="4394499">“Dear Member of Parliament, I'm answering your request for feedback on the specific euthanasia bill. First, a few generalities. I see the entire dynamics against a background where there is a movement for a culture of death, COD, and a movement for a culture of life. The culture of death tends to be hidden and manipulative. The well researched documentary CD called “Agenda” provides evidence of this. There are elitists who want to reduce the world population by almost any means. Some of them want to make a shambles of the capitalist system so that their socialist ideal swoops down as the saver of the world. It is ironic that these elitists are socialist. I have read that the CIA supported the radical feminist movement, which has been instrumental in tearing down family structures and consequently economic stability. Hilary Clinton said, quite clearly even if not in these exact words, because I don't remember exactly how she expressed it, that in our society there are Judeo-Christian values that “we” have to get rid of.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394500">Specific examples show this. “They rope in well-intentioned liberals, like fools conned into their service. Now to the specifics. The most dangerous thing about the bill is that there is nothing in the law to protect the conscience rights of medical personnel. This means we would have legislated immorality if the bill passes in its current form. Such a law would corrupt an important sector of the citizenry. Corrupt citizens are antithetical to a healthy democracy. If conscience protection is not in the law, it is almost certain that somehow the “inconvenience” of non-participating physicians will be swept aside by a bureaucracy, just as it is now in Quebec. The bill does have some restrictions. I can believe that it was drafted in order to satisfy the Supreme Court's mandate in a careful manner. There are two facts against an optimistic view of these restrictions. Note the language we hear on the news, about beginning gently with euthanasia. Such language indicates that the plan is over time to include more situations where euthanasia would be permissible. Make no mistake about these restrictions. Like dew on roses, they will evaporate. This has been the experience in Europe.”</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4394504">From a practical standpoint, it is almost impossible to make restrictions robust over time. The Council of Canadians with Disabilities says the bill does not provide protections it asked for in its vulnerable persons standard. Those protections, which are not in the bill, have to do with the assessment of vulnerabilities that may be inducing a person to seek assisted suicide as well as a review with the authorities with relevant expertise. In sum, the bill has three major drawbacks.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4394512">Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to the bill today in the House of Commons and share my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="2771" Type="2">Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394513">I am pleased to rise in the House today to speak to the legislation, as I said. I have had the honour of being a member of Parliament since 2004. I can honestly say that this is one of the most sensitive and controversial pieces of legislation that I have spoken to in the House. This is an issue that many Canadians have very strong opinions on, so it very important that throughout this process we respect all sides and ensure that we can come up with the best legislation possible, which responds to as many concerns as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394514">Today I would like to share some of my personal opinions on the legislation, as well as the expressed opinions of my constituents, many whom I have heard from. My vote on the bill will be based on what my constituents want and what my own conscience is telling me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394515">I recently wrote an op-ed in my local newspapers and distributed it to all media in the riding to connect with and consult with my constituents on the bill. I asked them to send their concerns to my office so that when I vote on the bill, I can be confident that I am voting in a manner that represents the views of my constituents. As of right now, the majority of my constituents, almost 80%, have told me to vote against the legislation. I want to point out that some of them are totally opposed to the bill and some would support some small amendments but are against it in its current form.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394516">Emails and letters are still coming in as we speak. The main concerns that have been presented by those who disagree with the bill are the need for further protections for the vulnerable, further protections for the conscience rights of health care workers, and the need for an improved national palliative care strategy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394517">I share many of the same concerns as my constituents. It is absolutely vital that there are safeguards for those who are vulnerable. For me, this includes three different groups of people. The first group would be children. We need to have a more robust discussion and study whether children under 18 years old should be allowed access to physician-assisted dying and who has the authority to make that decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394518">Second, it is paramount that those who have debilitating diseases, such as Alzheimer's, have a number of safeguards to ensure that they have fully consented to physician-assisted death while they were in a sound state of mind. The bill, as it is currently drafted, has a number of important first steps, but I feel it could go much further. The question is simple. Are there enough safeguards? Are we certain that we have it right?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394519">I appreciate the work that was done by the special committee that was struck to hold consultations before drafting the bill and also the work done by the justice committee. This has been a very one-sided and rushed process. When it comes to protecting the vulnerable, I do not want to leave any stone unturned. A matter like this deserves an intense and lengthy study by parliamentarians, all parliamentarians. It is very disturbing to know that at this point the government is not willing to have that full debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394520">Furthermore, it was made very clear in the House last night that the government is not willing to even entertain the notion of adopting any amendments, and that is wrong. On such a sensitive matter, it would have been my hope that the government would take a more sincere approach to working with other parties in an attempt to get the bill right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394521">A number of important amendments that would have addressed some very serious concerns were voted down by the government last night. I was deeply disappointed to see partisanship take precedence over common sense. It was refreshing to see some individuals, in all parties, vote according to their consciences and beliefs. That does not happen enough in this place, so I thank those members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394522">Finally is the question of whether the bill would allow those with mental illnesses to have access to physician-assisted death, as expressed by some of my colleagues. I would be very troubled if this was the case. It is my firm belief that mental illness is, in fact, an illness. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4394523">That being said, I would find it very troubling if an individual who was suffering from a mental illness had access to physician-assisted death. Mental illness quite possibly could mean that someone in a very poor state of mind, to use that terminology, could ask for assisted suicide when he or she would in all likelihood maybe not make this choice if in a sound state of mind. I believe this would send a wrong message to others suffering from mental illness. I am afraid that it would encourage more suicide, assisted or otherwise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394524">There are many groups in my riding who have put in a tremendous amount of work to combat mental illness and educate those suffering with mental illness that help is always available. We need to send that message that help is always available. Being able to seek physician-assisted death for a mental illness would, in my mind, run counter to this work. This is another area that deserves much closer study so that we as members of Parliament can be confident that the bill would not allow this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394525">Furthermore, National Nursing Week was only a few weeks ago. In light of this, it is very important to reiterate that we need robust protections for the conscience rights of health care professionals. Last night, the government had an opportunity to recognize the conscience rights of health care professionals, but chose not to take it. An amendment proposed by my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214396" Type="2">Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Affiliation> would have recognized that medical practitioners and health care professionals are free to refuse to provide direct or indirect medical assistance in dying. Unfortunately the government voted against this amendment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394526">The Charter of Rights and Freedoms states, “Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms”. What is first on that list? It is freedom of conscience and religion. I urge the government to put partisanship aside and recognize the charter rights of health care professionals. No one should be forced to perform any task that goes against his or her freedom of conscience or beliefs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394527"> I am not trying to reopen a previous debate held in the House, but I have to use an example that is very similar to the point that I am trying to make right now. Therefore, I would compare this to ministers or clergy who do not believe in performing same-sex marriages. Freedom of conscience and religion are fundamental freedoms that protect individuals who do not wish to take part in something that runs counter to their beliefs. This same kind of thing is not in the bill. Simply put, someone should not be required to participate in something or provide any service that she or he does not believe in. This must be an important consideration in designing the regulatory framework. Again, I wish that we had more time to hear from concerned health care professionals about this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394528">I would like to conclude with a comment on the timeline of this issue, and voice my concerns around putting forward legislation in such a rushed manner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394529">As I said earlier, I have been a member of Parliament since 2004, and in that 12 years that I have spent in this place, this bill is near or at the top of the list of the most intense and deeply sensitive matters I have spoken to. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394530">I fully recognize, as we all do in the House, the limitations on the orders that come from the Supreme Court. However, having said that, rushing through the bill and getting it not right is not worth the sake of a few days or weeks, whatever it takes. I urge all members to think about that. June 6 is a date that everybody has hard ingrained in their minds, but I am quite sure the courts would allow flexibility. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394531">Let us take the time and do it right. Given the sensitivity and public concern with this issue, I do not think that it is appropriate or prudent to rush through this process. I fully understand that there is a stated deadline, as I said, that the court has given Parliament to have it done. However, with this in mind, once again I have to point out that I have a number of concerns with the Supreme Court's limiting the ability of members of Parliament to have the time to have a robust debate and to allow for a more intense study of this important issue.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4394548"> The topic we are addressing today is a solemn one. As a result, the past few weeks have been emotional for all parliamentarians, myself included, as we have wrestled with the matter of assisted dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394549">The government had the responsibility to respond to the Supreme Court decision that was made in February 2015. I joined my colleagues in addressing that responsibility after we formed government in November 2015. Thus, in the very short time since forming government, there has been an incredible amount of work by officials and parliamentarians, with input from Canadians with a diverse range of views.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394550">Before us today is a legislative framework that we believe is the right approach for Canada. It is transformative. It would forever change the range of options that Canadians would have as they approach the end of their life. I would like to reflect on the principles that make up the foundation of our government's legislative approach in developing the legislation that is before the House today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394551">First, it is about the principle of personal autonomy, in helping people to write their own story, in a sense, in providing Canadians with access to medical assistance in dying, for the Supreme Court made it clear to us that Canadians must have that access.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394552">We have the responsibility to abide by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and we have the responsibility to put forth legislation that respects the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada. This legislation before the House today, if passed, would do just that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394553">The legislation also respects the principle of the inherent value of life. It is written, therefore, with appropriate safeguards that would protect vulnerable individuals. It would also firmly uphold the conscience rights of health care providers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394554">Over the past several weeks and months, I have had conversations with members in this chamber from all sides of the House. The <Affiliation DbId="214321" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> and I have appeared at committees in the House and the Senate. I have personally had numerous meetings and phone calls with many interested advocates, in addition to the witnesses whom committees have heard on this particular legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394555">It is worth noting today that the professional bodies that represent health care providers are supportive of this legislative approach. These include the Canadian Medical Association, Canadian Nurses Association, Canadian Pharmacists Association, and HealthCareCan, which represents our nation's hospitals and academic health sciences centres.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394556">Just today, parliamentarians received an open letter from 36 organizations representing the vulnerable, including the Canadian Association for Community Living, which has come out in support of this bill. Each organization may have continued areas of interest in which they wish to seek clarifications or undertake work with my department or with provinces and territories so that they can properly work with their members on implementing assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394557">As I have said in the past, this is an iterative process. It is why not only would we study further potential areas of assisted dying within a short period of time, if the legislation passes, but there would also be a parliamentary review of this important legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394558">Let us discuss the matter of timing. The Supreme Court of Canada gave our government an extension to put a legislative framework in place by June 6. Before going further, allow me to say that I respect the roles and responsibilities everyone has here as parliamentarians, as well as the responsibilities that senators hold in the upper chamber.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394559">There is a good reason for all of us to want to reflect upon and investigate this legislation in a thoughtful manner on behalf of Canadians. The reality is that we are facing a finite amount of time before there is a legal void, an absence of legislation to address the matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394560">Despite what some may say, there are real and very serious challenges if there is no legislative framework in place. As I said yesterday, there is a real risk that there could be no law in place by June 6. It is important to underscore what is at stake.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394561">First, organizations like the Canadian Medical Association and the Canadian Medical Protective Association have made it clear that they believe there is a vast majority of doctors who would not participate in assistance in dying without a legislative framework, despite the protections that some say the Carter decision provides.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4394562">Doctors are being advised by the appropriate associations to seek legal counsel before proceeding with any form of assisted dying, including consulting patients, and this would pose significant access issues and result in a situation where the Supreme Court's decision is not being realized.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394563">Second, it would be illegal for any other health care providers to offer assistance in dying. That means that nurses, pharmacists, social workers, and other providers recognized by amendments passed at committee would face no legal protection. In particular, pharmacists who are needed to dispense medications required for medical assistance in dying require clarification.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394564">Finally, there is the possibility that some could receive assistance in dying without a legislative framework in place, who would not otherwise have been eligible under the government's approach. This means, for example, the risk that someone facing severe depression could seek assistance in dying and that the safeguards to protect that individual would be inadequate or nonexistent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394565">I also want to remind members that medical assistance in dying is unlikely to be the choice for the vast majority of individuals at the end of life, and at its core our health care system is there to keep Canadians healthy. Canadians should have access to high-quality palliative care. This is something to which I have been, and will continue to be, committed to addressing with our provincial and territorial colleagues, along with the delivery of our government's platform commitment of $3 billion for home care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394566">Our government put forth this legislation that would transform end-of-life care options for Canadians. It is an approach that respects their rights under the charter, protects our most vulnerable, and considers the needs of health care providers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394567">I want to thank my fellow parliamentarians for their attention to the bill. Many of us are new to this role, and this is no small matter that we have been asked to address on behalf of the 36 million Canadians whom we represent. I thank them for engaging in the conversation with respect and dignity. I thank them for doing their utmost to consider the perspective of others, even if it differs greatly from their own. I thank them for the serious discourse we have undertaken in a situation where it is likely impossible to write legislation that would entirely satisfy every diverse view.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394568">Recognizing our responsibility to implement legislation, I urge members to support Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> for today's final vote.

              <ParaText id="4394577">As the member knows, we were asked to establish legislation on the matter of medical assistance in dying. The Carter decision included language around grievous and irremediable conditions. In drafting the legislation, it was felt that there had to be further clarification, which has been supported by health care workers who, in one sense, did not want to be limited by a particular deadline to say it is expected that a person is within six months of dying. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394578">This is a piece of language that has been supported to respect the professional opinion of health care providers who know when a grievous and irremediable condition has reached the point that death is reasonably foreseeable.</ParaText>

I recognize that some have argued that this is not an important point, but I want members to understand that, if what is important to them is that Canadians have access to medical assistance in dying, the best way to do that is to support this legislation. Without it, health care providers require further clarification. They are being advised to seek legal counsel. There will be serious problems with accessing medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>

Irish immigrants began arriving in the area around 1815 and continued to do so even after the great tragedy of 1847, where hundreds of Irish immigrants perished on Middle Island after fleeing the famine in their homeland. Many of the survivors flourished, however, and started new lives on the banks of the Miramichi River. </ParaText>

Farrell was also the well-deserved recipient of the Douglas Hyde Award, which was presented to him last month by Dr. Ray Bassett, the Irish ambassador to Canada. </ParaText>

Our commitment to increase the trust and confidence that Canadians have in our democratic institutions began as a result of 10 years of trampling on our democratic institutions by the party opposite. Canadians asked us to review the options available to us, not just the way we vote, not just online voting and mandatory voting, but to take partisanship and patronage out of our Canadian democratic institutions. That is what we are doing. It is time for the other side to come on board and help us.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4394868">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the third reading debate on Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, which would provide a federal framework on medically assisted dying. As acknowledged by many in the House in the last number of weeks, medical assistance in dying is a complex, challenging, and deeply personal issue for us all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394869">Since the Supreme Court of Canada rendered its unanimous decision in Carter last year, it has been discussed by many Canadians in different settings from coast to coast to coast. The issues continue to be debated and thoughtfully discussed worldwide, from the United States to Europe to Australia and New Zealand. Almost everywhere in the world, the act of ending one's life deliberately and the act of helping someone to end their life are serious crimes punishable by severe sentences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394870">Nevertheless, Canada is not alone in creating a legislative regime to permit medical assistance in dying. There are four American states, Oregon, Washington, Vermont, and California, the country of Colombia, and the three European countries of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg that currently have legislative regimes that allow some form of medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394871">These different international regimes share similarities, especially with regard to safeguards, oversight, and reporting, most of which are included in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. These similarities are as follows: requests for medical assistance in dying must be in writing, made voluntarily by the patient, and in many cases witnessed by independent witnesses; a second opinion from an independent physician must be sought; and a delay or reflection period between the request and the actual provision of medical assistance in dying is required.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394872">Colombia has a unique approval process for medical assistance in dying. It involves interdisciplinary committees within each hospital that assess requests and support patients and their families throughout the process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394873">In addition, almost all international regimes have mandatory oversight systems involving independent national or regional committees and government agencies or departments, which collect and process data in order to properly monitor medical assistance in dying. They make annual or biannual reports on medical assistance public in their respective jurisdictions. This evidence was critical to the Supreme Court of Canada's analysis in the Carter litigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394874">Unlike the fairly consistent approaches, the safeguard and oversight that we see in other countries, the various laws take two different approaches with regard to both: one, the form of medical assistance in dying that is permitted; and, two, the medical circumstances under which it can legally be provided.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394875">One could describe the different approaches with regard to eligibility and the form as being a spectrum. At one end of the spectrum stands the four American states that enacted the legislation, starting with Oregon in 1997, Washington in 2008, Vermont in 2013, and most recently California, just last year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394876">In these states, a mentally competent adult aged 18 years or older can obtain the assistance of a physician to die, only if their request is voluntary, and if they suffer from a terminal disease, which is defined as an incurable and irreversible disease that has been medically confirmed and will, within reasonable medical judgment, produce death within six months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394877">In the U.S. states, the physician is only permitted to provide the patient with a prescription for a substance that the patient must self-administer at a time of their choosing. This is commonly known as physician-assisted suicide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394878">What is commonly called euthanasia, where the physician administers an injection to the patient, is expressly prohibited in these states. Advance requests are also not allowed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394879">While these legislative measures in the U.S. accommodate individuals suffering from diseases that cause a steady, rapid, and predictable decline toward death, such as some forms of cancer, they do not accommodate other conditions, including some degenerative diseases that are enduring and predictable, nor do they enable patients who are physically unable to self-administer a substance to access a medically assisted death.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="15">(1515)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4394880">The Colombian regime, which was developed in response to two rulings from its Constitutional Court, has eligibility criteria similar to that of the U.S. states. It limits eligibility to adults who have a terminal illness, defined as a progressive and irreversible serious condition or pathology that will cause death within a relatively short time frame. It does not require the person to have a prognosis of six months, but it does require that death is expected in the short term. Unlike the American states, Colombia only permits a physician to administer a substance that causes a person's death. However, Colombia's regime does permit a patient to prepare an advance request for medically assisted death, which is not permitted in the <?bk?>U.S.<?ek?></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394881">At the other end of the spectrum, there is Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, known as the “Benelux” countries. In these three northern European countries, patients are eligible for medical assistance in dying if they have “intolerable” or “unbearable” physical or psychological suffering resulting from a serious and incurable medical condition where there is no prospect for improvement. Eligible individuals do not need to be dying or suffering from life-threatening conditions. Both physician-assisted suicide and what is commonly called voluntary euthanasia are permitted in these countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394882">While advance requests are permitted, there are some differences between the Benelux states. In Belgium and Luxembourg, advance requests can only be carried out where the patient is in a state of irreversible unconsciousness, while in the Netherlands, advance requests are also permitted where patients are unable to express their wishes but are conscious, such as for persons with dementia or Alzheimer's.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394883">While medical assistance in dying is only available to adults in Luxembourg, children as young as 12 years of age can request medical assistance in dying with their parents' consent in the Netherlands. In Belgium, adults and emancipated minors can request medical assistance in dying for the same kinds of conditions. In 2014, Belgium extended eligibility to minors of any age, but only where they are likely to die in the short term and where their suffering is physical. Additional safeguards must also be met.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394884">The experience and lessons from the Benelux countries have been closely examined. For example, in the Netherlands, while the legislation permits advance requests for patients who have lost their ability to express their wishes, Dutch research suggests that physicians are generally unwilling to provide medical assistance in dying, due to the inability of these patients to comprehend their medical condition and their inability to express informed consent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394885">The government has sought to learn from the experiences of other jurisdictions. The proposed legislation is broader than the U.S. state approach, which only permits those with a fatal disease to access assistance. Instead, Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> provides the option of a peaceful death to everyone who is in decline toward the natural end of their life, not just those who suffer from fatal diseases or terminal illnesses. At the same time, it avoids some of the risks that the Benelux-style regimes might present, although such broader questions, and the experience of other regimes around the world, will continue to be studied.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4394896"> However, many members are concerned about advance directives. The committee said that studies would begin within six months. However, one of the things that is very important to note is that advance directives, even in the one country that allows it for people with dementia and other declining illnesses, is not really carried out. In the Netherlands, given the concerns about what someone's wishes actually are at the time of death if they have dementia, almost nothing happens. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4394901">This is a very difficult time in my short political career, because it is a sensitive subject that should be free of partisanship. All opinions are right, and no one is wrong. We are all good Canadians of good conscience, and we are looking for the best solution on such a sensitive subject.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394902"> When it comes to this subject, we are not here to try to convince anyone; we are here to explain our point of view. According to the Supreme Court’s decision in the Carter case, it is not a matter of determining whether we are for or against medical assistance in dying, but of determining how we will apply it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394903"> Here we are at the final reading of Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. At my leader’s invitation, I had the privilege of participating in the parliamentary committee that studied the matter and produced a main report and a dissenting report. My official opposition colleagues and I signed the dissenting report, while my Conservative colleagues in the Senate signed the main report. This shows that there was no partisanship in our approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394904"> In our dissenting report, we raised five major concerns. Most of them were noted by the government and are reflected in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. We were against the medical assistance in dying bill applying to minors; the government listened to us. We were against the bill applying in the case of mental illness; the government listened to us. We wanted complete openness concerning conscience protections for physicians and institutions; the government listened to us in part. We also wanted a clear commitment from the government concerning palliative care; the government listened to us in part. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394905">On another note, I salute my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="214504" Type="2">Sarnia—Lambton</Affiliation>, who introduced Bill <Document DbId="8286156" Type="4">C-277</Document> in the House almost exactly 24 hours ago. The aim of this private member’s bill is to force the government to make a firm commitment to provide the necessary palliative care to as many Canadians as possible. As we know, only one-third of Canadians have access to that type of care. With Bill <Document DbId="8286156" Type="4">C-277</Document>, we want that to be enforced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394906">Those are the elements of Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> that we consider positive or semi-positive. Now here are the things that are of great concern to us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394907"> First, there is the famous definition of reasonably foreseeable death. For us, this makes absolutely no sense. “Reasonably foreseeable” means both everything and nothing. I am going to die some day. That is reasonably foreseeable, of course, but it means absolutely nothing. From sage experience, Quebec used the expression “end of life”. That is at least clearer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394908"> There is also the matter of nurse practitioners, who have the same decision-making powers as physicians under the bill. I have tremendous respect for nurses, and I know what I am talking about, since they are often the first people, and sometimes the only people, who see us when we are in hospital. However, when it is a matter of life or death, and that is literally the issue here, I would prefer that physicians have the ultimate responsibility rather than the wonderful nurses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394909">The points I have just mentioned are based on Quebec’s experience. I know what I am talking about, because I was a member of the National Assembly of Quebec. We worked on and gave serious consideration to the issues surrounding medical assistance in dying for six years, whereas here in the House we had only a few months to do the same work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394910">Later, I will talk about an unfortunate statement we heard during question period. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394911">Based on Quebec’s experience, we built our case for the dissenting report. The current bill includes some elements in full, others to some extent, and still others not at all. It is a fairly even balance of the positive and negative elements. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394912"> Then there remains the famous issue of constitutionality. Every bill that is put forward can be challenged. In fact, whatever bill was introduced, it would have been challenged by one group or another. For weeks, some people have been saying that it is constitutional, and others have been saying that it is not. Most of the people we heard from said that it did not make sense and that it did not comply with the Constitution or the Carter decision. However, this morning, in <I>La Presse</I>, if I remember correctly, three constitutional experts from three different universities, namely Laval University, the University of Montreal, and UQAM, said it was constitutional. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4394915"> The charter issue is another interesting point. Some people say it complies with the charter, while others say it does not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394916"> Let us try not to be too partisan. If we cannot rely on the Liberal government to draft a bill that complies with the charter, whom can we rely on? Do I need to remind anyone that it was the Liberal Party, under the leadership of the Right Hon. Pierre Elliott Trudeau, father of the current <Affiliation DbId="89563" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who enshrined the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in the 1982 Constitution, signed some 300 feet from here by Her Majesty the Queen on April 17, 1982? We all remember that. The sky was overcast, and at the very moment the signing took place, there was a rumble of thunder. Just a brief history lesson.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394917"> Seriously, I am not the greatest fan of the charter, much less of the Liberal Party, especially not the Liberal Party, but good Lord, if we cannot rely on the Liberal government to draft a bill that complies with the charter, I wonder whom we can rely on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394918">The events are balanced. This bill has good points and bad points. Over the past 24 hours, three events occurred that are worth thinking about. First, yesterday we voted on 10 possible amendments and they were all defeated by the Liberal majority. I commend the government members who voted against their party's position for their courage, honour, and dignity. Well done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394919">However, I believe that two of those amendments, both of them introduced by the member for <Affiliation DbId="213892" Type="2">St. Albert—Edmonton</Affiliation>, were essential.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394920">The first amendment protected the most vulnerable members of our society by proposing that people undergo a psychiatric assessment before giving their consent. We think that is extremely important because protecting the most vulnerable members of our society is essential. Nevertheless, the government voted against that amendment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394921">The second amendment had to do with conscience protections for institutions. I speak on behalf on my friends from Quebec when I say that, in Quebec, institutions such as hospitals are secular. However, outside Quebec, some institutions are religious and act according to the dictates of their conscience. We need to protect their conscience rights, but this bill does not do that. We proposed that amendment, but the government voted against it. That is unfortunate. The government refused to accept amendments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394922">Moreover, this morning, Quebec's health and social services minister, Gaétan Barrette, made a statement. I know the guy. He is honest, hard-working, conscientious, and a man of integrity. He is also a medical specialist who was once an administrator and is now a minister.

              <ParaText id="4394940">Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to rise in my place today and add the voices of my constituents to the debate on Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, an act to amend the Criminal Code and to make related amendments to other acts, regarding medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394941">I want to begin by telling this House that, in the almost nine years that I have been a member of this place, I have not been asked about or received as much correspondence as I have on the matter of physician-assisted suicide. It is clear that Canadians and members of this House have varied and deeply held beliefs and convictions on this issue, which have been informed by our life experiences. We members also have a responsibility to balance our personal beliefs with those of our constituents and the incredible wealth of knowledge they share with us. The widespread reaction to this short debate in Parliament confirms my belief and, I believe, the belief of my colleagues that physician-assisted suicide represents the defining issue of this Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394942">Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> would have the most lasting impact on Canadians and the social fabric of our society because each one of us could at some point see someone we know struggle with such a decision. My constituents' opinions on this issue have been genuine, considered, and informative, with a clear majority opposing physician-assisted suicide. I am pleased to inform them that I share their views. I believe in the inviolable dignity of all human life, and that it is to be protected by law from conception to natural death. Therefore, I have opposed and will continue to oppose any attempt to legalize euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394943">I have grave concerns with the process surrounding the introduction and passage of this bill. I am cognizant that Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> is now at third reading and that many members are still grappling with how they will vote later today. I hope all members will be able to vote freely, as Conservative members will be able to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394944">This legislation was first introduced in this place on April 14, less than two months ago. Passing a bill in a month and a half is a challenge under any circumstances, but passing a bill of this magnitude and in this amount of time is reckless and demonstrates a complete disregard for the significance of this issue to all Canadians. As my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="214456" Type="2">Lethbridge</Affiliation> noted in her earlier remarks, the Supreme Court of Canada has sent Parliament into an unending abyss of grey, and each day parliamentarians are being tested on the future limits of this legislation as one what-if leads to another. I do not believe that all the impacts of this bill can be assessed in such a tight timeline, as this truly is a new moral space for Canadians to contemplate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394945">Like many of us here, I am concerned that minors may eventually be able to attain medical assistance in dying. I am concerned for the well-being of those struggling through mental illness because, quite frankly, we as a country are only now beginning to recognize and understand its reach and impacts on so many. As well, I am concerned with the notion that doctors who for legitimate reasons of faith or conscience oppose medical assistance in dying would be forced to participate in this process contrary to their personal ethics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394946">While the government has presented us with a bill that is much narrower in scope than the recommendations made by the special committee, stakeholders on both sides of this issue have raised many what-is-next questions. These have not been answered, and I am therefore disappointed that consultations and debate on Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> are ending prematurely.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394947">Many of my constituents have suggested that the government should consider using section 33 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the notwithstanding clause, to prevent physician-assisted suicide rather than rushing a bill through Parliament that appears to fully satisfy no one. I want the government and my constituents to know that I would support using the notwithstanding clause to prevent the Supreme Court's decision in Carter v. Canada from having any effect. While I am not a constitutional expert, I assume that section 33 was included in the charter because the prime minister and the premiers of the day wanted to affirm that a democratically elected federal Parliament and provincial legislatures, and not the judicial branch, would have the responsibility to pass laws on matters of public policy.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="45">(1545)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4394948">By refusing to invoke the notwithstanding clause, the government is prematurely ending our deliberations on this bill, and consequently removing many voices from the discussion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394949">Parliament should be passing laws that the courts then interpret within the charter. Courts should not be telling Parliament what laws it needs to pass and by when they must be passed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394950">I do not believe that former premier of Saskatchewan Allan Blakeney would have signed the charter without the presence of the notwithstanding clause, as it protected the rights of Saskatchewan's legislature to override a court decision with which it might not agree.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4394956">Liberal members have continuously used the June 6 deadline as justification to pass the bill quickly, yet I would posit that the notwithstanding clause exists precisely so that Parliament, and not the courts, can set the timeline on important matters of public policy. At the very least, the government could have used this clause to give itself more time to consult Canadians and draft legislation that conforms to the court's decision and protects life. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394957">Quebec's National Assembly took six years to develop its legislation on physician-assisted suicide, yet the Supreme Court only gave the federal government a total of 16 months to put in place new legislation. Unfortunately, it is clear that using the notwithstanding clause is not an approach that the current government would even consider.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394958">I will use my remaining time to address the issue of conscience rights for medical professionals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394959"> I believe that opening the door to physician-assisted suicide is a slippery slope for our society. However, I believe that it is even more reckless if we fail to protect conscience rights in this legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394960">Without adequate protection for the conscience rights of medical professionals, Parliament, and more specifically the current governing party, is inserting the thinnest edge of the wedge when it comes to legislative disregard for conscience rights. If the current Parliament fails to respect these rights, we are setting a most dangerous precedent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394961"> Precedents matter. Members might not be in the House or even alive to see the effects that the precedents set by passing Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> may have, which is why the protection of conscience rights today is so important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394962"> I would have expected that most in this place would support conscience rights for medical professionals. I took at face value that the government included a mention of conscience rights in the preamble of the bill as an indication of its support for the principle, but the results of last night's vote demonstrated that this was not the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394963">No one is a permanent or an eternal member of this place. Just like legislators in past parliaments, the only lasting effect we can have on the future is to be clear in our intentions through the laws we pass today. Therefore, it behooves us as members of the 42nd Parliament to be very specific in what is allowed and what is being protected with this piece of legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394964"> In conclusion, our only legacy as a Parliament is what we pass into law. We have a responsibility to get this legislation right and ensure that all the issues that have been raised are addressed.</ParaText>

It was used once by Alberta on same sex marriage, about which even my Conservative colleagues have changed their minds last weekend. More important, it was used in Quebec, which I personally experienced, on the language of signs. The Quebec government promised English-speaking Quebeckers that bilingual signs would be allowed, and then reversed itself and used the notwithstanding clause to tell our community that we had no place to be visible in our own province.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394968">I would ask the hon. member, based on the Canadian experiences of the use of this clause—how an entire community felt their rights had been recognized in the court and then thrown out by their own government—how she could believe that we should use a notwithstanding clause in a case like this.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4394980">Let me start by acknowledging how challenging an issue this is. It is difficult for a person to engage in a conversation about death, yet our government has honourably taken on this responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394981">On April 30, I participated in a York Region town hall, where a sizeable portion of the attendees were from Richmond Hill. They passionately spoke to this matter from all sides. I am inspired by the passion found within my constituency, and I would like to assure them, and all Canadians, that we are in this together. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394982">I am sharing my story with the House, a story that complements the perspective of my constituents, and the work that we do in the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394983">This is the story of my father's journey dealing with the inner turmoil caused by cancer. It is the exact reason why I am so passionate about the bill. I wrestled with this issue because each one of my hats had a strong stake in this debate and the final decision to be made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394984"> The difficulty of beating cancer is well known to many. However, despite the odds, my father fought this disease. He fought it with all his power and he succeeded. Unfortunately, his success was short-lived and he relapsed in no time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394985">As a loving and supportive family, we did everything for my father to keep him happy and comfortable during the end of his days. However, no matter what we did, it was not good enough to relieve his pain. No amount of moral and social support was stronger than his inner suffering. We provided him with palliative care, but it was not enough. It broke my heart to watch my father slowly lose himself through the process. At the end, he was more concerned about the impact of his suffering on us than on him. After all, his pain was alleviated with heavy doses of morphine. However, there was no remedy for his mental pain and the hit to his pride.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394986">I have heard the concern that providing medical assistance in dying would negatively impact vulnerable people. However, as I stated before, what made my father vulnerable was not having the option to put an end to his journey.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394987">Eventually, my father suffered from two illnesses, one physical and the other mental. The amount of pain he was going through physically began affecting him psychologically as well. He began isolating himself from us, and in the end was suffering alone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394988">I agree with the government's commitment to support quality end-of-life services and to continue working with the provinces and territories to improve palliative care. Canadians and the Richmond Hill community have made it clear that is what they want. To that end, the government has committed to a long-term investment into palliative care of $3 billion over four years. However, no amount of investment into palliative care would have relieved my father's agony.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394989">My father's experience is not a unique one. I am sure that others in the House know of someone who has endured similar distress.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394990">We have a big responsibility to Canadians. Our responsibility is to make Canada great, to provide Canadians with the means for a better life, to facilitate their realization of their vision, and to help them achieve their dreams and aspirations. We were elected to represent their wishes, to provide services, and to make legislation to achieve those ends.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4394991">Let us look at the data that speaks to what Canadians want. Polls show that a majority of Canadians accept the idea and would even request medical assistance in dying if it were available to them. Those polls also show that over the years the acceptance level of medical assistance in dying has been been increasing. As Canadians became more aware of the matter, they began to empathize with those who suffer. In Richmond Hill alone, the local parliament project has shown that over 70% of my riding agrees that individuals who are terminally ill should be allowed to end their lives with the assistance of a medical professional. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394992">In February of 2016, a Statistics Canada demographic analysis showed that persons aged 65 and over make up a record proportion of our population. It also showed that the proportion of seniors in our population has been increasing over the past 50 years, and the trend is continuing. What does this mean for us as legislators and representatives? It means that we must be forward thinking in our legislation and we must ensure there are mechanisms in place to deal with future problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394993">The Carter case has shown us already that our current legislation is outdated, and the Supreme Court has asked us to update it. We are faced with a June 6 deadline. Let us ensure that we are prepared for this demographic shift and potential needs, such as the one on the table today. In order to ensure that we are prepared for this shift, we must ensure that we address key issues in our current system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394994">According to a research article published by the journal <I>Palliative Medicine</I>, in Canada, we need to streamline our legislative, financial, and regulatory affairs in terms of delivery of palliative care services. This means that once the legislation is passed we must continue to conduct studies and address lagging areas of hospice and palliative care services delivery. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394995">I was fortunate enough to hear points of view from my neighbours in Richmond Hill during the town hall. They opened up their hearts and shared with me. The most powerful story came from people suffering with terminal illnesses, similar to the one my father had. They spoke of the importance of making advance requests, addressing the issue of mental illness, and access to mature minors. I am happy to hear that the government will appoint independent bodies to study these issues. I have seen members of the relevant committees work hard to ensure that they provide a reasonable approach to the legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394996">It is after carefully thinking through all these issues that I have decided to support Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394997">I realize our government has genuinely worked hard on the bill. As it stands, Canadians do not have a choice on how to say goodbye to this world. My father died in my arms. He died in an attempt to say something to me, something I will never know. He did not choose when to leave me. He did not choose how to leave. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394998">Through my declaration of Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, I am sending four messages. To my conscience, I can say rest assured that with this decision I have balanced the three hats and their responsibilities to the best of my ability.

To my constituents and the Richmond Hill community, I want to assure them they were consulted, they were heard, and they are well represented. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4394999">To all Canadians, it has been a long and hard journey, but the journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step. However, in order for the journey to begin, the bill needs to pass. Let us work together to take that first step. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4395012">Mr. Speaker, I believe that Canadians need to have the option of how to end their lives. Unfortunately, my father did not have that option. When he was diagnosed with an advanced case of cancer, we consulted with the doctor and asked for options. We were basically given very interesting options. We were told that if we were religious, to go pray, and if we were science believers, to go bet on the science that in 5% of the cases like my father's the person would die from a heart attack. The other 95% would suffer deeply and go through organ failure. Whether we believe in science or not, we were lucky that he made the transition as a result of a heart attack when he passed away. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4395014">I believe that Canadians should have this option. My father would have suffered much less had he not experienced that prolonged mental distress. The government has announced that it will appoint one or more independent bodies to study advance requests in the context of medical assistance in dying. I look forward to being part of that consultation process and I invite all members in the House to participate. As I said, this is a journey of a hundred thousand miles and this is the first step. We have to take that first step, but we need to stay engaged.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4395015">Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for sharing his speaking time with me. It is small consolation, since the members of my political party were excluded from the committee formed to produce a bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395016"> Today, I can only say that we are witness to a sad chapter in the history of “parliamentary” democracy in Ottawa and in the House of Commons. I would even say that it is the product of a deplorable process, in both form and content.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395017"> Quebec has been cited often as an example. I followed and participated in that process. It was a process that aimed for transpartisanship, not just in words, not just in spin, but in actual fact. The goal of that transpartisanship was to achieve the broadest possible consensus. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395018"> Obviously, there was no Carter decision. Consequently, the Quebec government and the opposition parties included what was a step forward with regard to the problem of end-of-life care. They included medical assistance in dying in a continuum of end-of-life care, which is a provincial responsibility, by the way. They combined what was always considered distinct, that is, palliative care versus euthanasia, and they said that from then on, Quebec would provide end-of-life care. Obviously, that would take place in a palliative care setting, because there would no longer be any point to curative care. When someone goes to palliative care, recovery is no longer possible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395019"> At that point, they said that there would be palliative care, in which a person can die voluntarily at the conclusion of his or her end-of-life process, which is irremediable and already under way. The person is then in the terminal phase of life. If, one morning, the person, having received the appropriate palliative care, is completely at peace and ready to let go, this is not a failure of palliative care. That could be considered what we might wish for everyone here, that is, to be on one’s death bed, utterly serene, ready to let go and at peace with oneself. Palliative care can also lead to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395020">That is what Quebec decided to do, but it did not do so in the way the Liberal Party chose to do it. The Liberals steamrolled parliamentarians, and this bill was controlled by the executive from beginning to end, with the excuse that June 6 was a deadline that could not be circumvented. At the moment, we are well aware that with all the pitfalls and problems in this bill, it is impossible to meet that deadline. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395021"> The government should have, with the assent of all parliamentarians, given us the means to act and found ways of doing things properly instead of gagging people, since we know full well the deadline will not be met. We are told that it is very serious, but I must point out that the Morgentaler decision was struck down and declared unconstitutional as far back as 1988, but as far as I know, it is still in the Criminal Code, and we have not descended into total chaos in that area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395022"> We have to move forward, but let us not get carried away. With regard to form and content, the question we have to address at this stage is the minister’s unproven claim that her bill passes the charter test.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395023"> In the Morgentaler decision, the judges struck down the abortion law based on just one of the principles, just one of the rights affirmed in section 7 of the charter: “Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person”. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4395024"> Since the judges in the Carter case decided that three rights had been unreasonably infringed, namely the right to liberty, the right to life and the right to security of the person, it would suffice for just one of these rights to be infringed for it to be unreasonably infringed and for section 1 to fail to save the minister’s law. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395025"> Now, I asked her the question several times. I asked her to show me how a grievous and irremediable disease or disability that causes a patient intolerable suffering does not unreasonably infringe the right of that patient to security of the person. According to the government’s bill, to have access to medical assistance in dying, this person will have to either go before the courts, or go on a hunger strike so as to approximate the totally deplorable, inhuman, vague and unconstitutional criterion of reasonably foreseeable natural death.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395026"> The government never made an effort to accept even one of the amendments, however unimportant, from the opposition. It amended its bill on its own. I have never seen an attitude so contemptuous of the legislature. If this is the legislative democracy and the legislative powers of the House of Commons, it is hard to swallow, especially on a subject as sensitive as this one. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395027"> However much we boasted, if we were that sure of ourselves, we still had the option of referring this to the Supreme Court. It is true that it is not up to the Supreme Court justices to make the laws. However Parliament did nothing for the last 40 years. Eventually, certain citizens won a judgment. The only solution recommended over the last 40 years was palliative care, as if that were the answer to all our problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395028"> The Carter decision must not resolve only the end-of-life issue, but also the assisted suicide issue. There are people on the other side of the House who do not even differentiate between suicide and assisted suicide, which is in fact decriminalized. These are not the same realities. Suicide is not irremediable as long as the person has not acted out. A suicidal state can be corrected. There are people who are able to help these persons; there is therapy and medication.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395029"> However, when a person is suffering from Alzheimer’s, that is irreversible. If the government had agreed to remove this criterion, it would have corrected a number of shortcomings in this bill. In particular, it would have made it possible for any request to be made in advance, meaning that people could make a valid request before becoming incapable of doing so. However, the government is doing only as it wishes and is washing its hands of this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395030">The government is displaying political cowardice regarding the role it is obliged to play in the House. It is not the democracy of judges that we are demanding, but rather a democracy that respects the legislative power and the ability of legislators to define laws. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395031">Also, let us stop trivializing things. It is our duty to make good laws that make sense. Judges, as custodians of rights and freedoms, have the duty to determine whether those laws are in compliance with the charter and the Constitution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395032"> Therefore let us stop claiming that any law that leaves this place will necessarily be challenged and that the judges will have to make a ruling. What is absolutely inhumane is that the burden of litigation will fall on the shoulders of vulnerable persons and those who are suffering.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4395060">As a new member, I had, for my very first experience on a committee, the immense privilege of sitting on the Special Joint Committee on Physician-Assisted Dying. It was a privilege in a number of respects. First, I was there with my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="214384" Type="2">Victoria</Affiliation>, who shared with me his experience as well as his expertise as a constitutional lawyer. He was very generous in allowing me to work with him in the committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395061"> It was also a privilege because it was an opportunity to learn about all the work that had been done since February 6, 2015, when the Supreme Court handed down its decision in the Carter case. We read the report of the group of experts that criss-crossed Canada throughout last summer and fall and met with everyone interested in the issue of medical assistance in dying. They also met with people in the various American states that have had medical assistance in dying for 10 or 20 years. They went to Europe. They reported to us on everything they had learned about medical assistance in dying. We also read the report of the group of provincial and territorial experts. Although Quebec was the trail-blazer, working on the issue for six years and passing a law on end-of-life care last December, several provinces have studied the issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395062"> It was also a privilege to hear over 60 witnesses who came to present their points of view, whether as legal experts or as physicians. We met with representatives of different professional associations such as nurses and pharmacists. I found it really rewarding to hear all these witnesses and to better understand the different points of view. Indeed, on the subject of medical assistance in dying, as has been noted, there can be an opinion and its counter-argument. It was in light of all these views that we arrived at our recommendations. However, the particularly rewarding aspect of sitting on this committee was the commitment of the 11 MPs and five senators who gave full meaning to the term “working together”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395063">As a member of this committee, I developed a great sense of fellowship with all these parliamentarians. In spite of our differing views, we took the time to listen to each other, and we were respectful in our work. We spent dozens if not hundreds of hours working together. In spite of our differences of opinion, we were all committed to arriving at the best possible outcome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395064">This commitment to so complex and delicate a subject was for me a truly useful experience. Unfortunately, when I reported for the first meeting of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, the first evening when we did the clause-by-clause study and when we considered what I regard as the most significant amendments dealing with the most fundamental elements of the bill, I did not feel at all that open-mindedness, that commitment on the part of the Liberal representatives sitting on that committee. I did not feel that same willingness to listen to each other to arrive at the best possible outcome. </ParaText>

They may have been checking their email, because they spent a lot of time with their noses buried in their tablets or looking at the ceiling. They mechanically voted against the amendments proposed by the opposition. Viewed from the outside, they seemed to be acting like good little soldiers. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4395067"> Since tabling our report, I have fallen into the habit of saying that it will be relevant for at least 10 years. Of course, I did not expect the government to take all of our recommendations into account. In so short a time, that was not possible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395068"> Basically, what the Supreme Court has told us is that medical assistance in dying is a right. Since it is a right, therefore, we were motivated throughout our discussions and our work by the desire to be sure not to discriminate against anyone. However, this evening I will be obliged to vote against this bill, even though I have invested hundreds of hours of work in it and even though I have read thousands of pages and heard all those witnesses. For me, reasonably foreseeable natural death is a ground of discrimination, based on age, for example. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395069">As a member of the special joint committee, I had the opportunity to take time to meet with my constituents. I wanted to seek out the wisdom of those who work with persons at the end of life before taking a position on the various recommendations. I wanted to test my assumptions and my thoughts. I had the opportunity to meet, for example, with Les Amis du crépuscule. This community organization in my riding works every day with persons at the end of their lives. Those workers told me that they would respectfully welcome anything that we would decide, because they welcome the choices that people make. Indeed, the question of medical assistance in dying is essentially a question of choice. One person may choose to request such assistance. Another, who for reasons of conscience or other reasons cannot accept calling for medical assistance in dying, need only refrain from requesting it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395070"> These meetings made me realize just how unavailable palliative care is in our communities. The member for <Affiliation DbId="214384" Type="2">Victoria</Affiliation> and I made note of this in our supplementary opinion in the report of the special joint committee. My riding includes the Hôtel-Dieu, one of the largest hospitals for long-term care in Quebec. Hundreds of persons die there every year. There are only 12 beds for palliative care. We have one home that accommodates people at the end of life who are suffering from cancer. This home receives 800 applications per year and can accept only 200. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395071">Some people have told me that, if they have to be ill as they end their lives, they want to have quality care and to live with dignity beforehand, so they can die with dignity. This was a very strong message for me, because fundamentally, we must remember that this bill is intended to ensure that each of our fellow citizens is able to die with dignity. </ParaText>

I am a member of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, and I take exception to the fact that she mentioned that during the very considerable and time-consuming debate on the amendments before the committee, the Liberals were not interested, not listening, or not working in the best interests of Canadians. The fact that we happen to disagree with some of the amendments that were put forward by the parties opposite does not mean that we were not taking our job seriously. I do not think it was fair to characterize it in those terms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395074">There were in fact 16 amendments made at committee, some proposed by the NDP, some by the Bloc, and some by the Conservative Party. We worked collaboratively on things such as amending the preamble and putting palliative care in it, as well as amending conscience rights to include a clause to ensure that nothing could compel anyone to perform the service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395075">I note as well that the NDP voted against almost all, if not all, of the proposals by the Conservative Party. Therefore, for her to say that Liberals were not interested would cause me to wonder if the New Democrats were not interested in listening when other amendments from other parties were put forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395076">My question is this. Does she not agree that Liberals worked collaboratively and that the 16 amendments did improve the bill at committee?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4395096">While I acknowledge the government's expressed desire to get the bill passed before the Supreme Court's June 6 deadline, I think most people agree that this is too important a piece of legislation to rush, especially considering that in its present form it is not likely to pass constitutional muster. On this, I second NDP justice critic, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214384" Type="2">Victoria</Affiliation>, when he said, “I cannot accept passing a bill that I know to be unconstitutional”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395097">The key flaw of Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> is the end-of-life requirement of a reasonably foreseeable natural death. This is the part that conflicts with the Supreme Court, which did not require terminality or end of life, and therefore, according to the Carter decision, infringes on the charter rights of all those who have a grievous and irremediable condition that causes them intolerable suffering but who are not dying as a result. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395098">The Canadian and Quebec bar associations, various other legal experts, and now the Alberta Court of Appeal, has said that this requirement conflicts with the Supreme Court. Medical groups do not like it either. The body that represents every provincial medical regulator has come out against the bill as being too vague for doctors to follow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395099">The NDP put forward a number of amendments that would have improved the bill tremendously. Had they not been rejected, the bill would likely have had a better shot at making it through the Senate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395100">We suggested removing the controversial end-of-life requirement, which is almost certainly unconstitutional, and replacing it with the exact words that the Supreme Court used in its decision. However, the Liberals rejected that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395101">Of more than 100 amendments moved, just 16 were accepted, and they were mostly minor technical clarifications. However, the NDP did manage to secure agreement on two amendments that were introduced and adopted unanimously, and that was clarifying conscience objection rights and adding a stronger commitment to palliative care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395102">As criticism grows against the bill, the government increasingly falls back on the excuse of a deadline imposed on us by the Supreme Court, which is not exactly true. The court said that it would give federal and provincial governments a year to put in place more complex regulatory regimes should they choose. On June 6, an exemption is opened in two Criminal Code offences for patients and physicians acting within the guidelines that the court set out in the Carter decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395103"> There is not a vacuum, and to be blunt, murder will not become legal, nor will medical aid in dying return to being illegal without a federal law in place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395104">Over the past year, every provincial medical regulator has developed guidelines for medical aid in dying that physicians must follow. These safeguards are very close to the safeguards proposed in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. Federal leadership is necessary to ensure that access is equitable across Canada and to prevent a patchwork, but it is not strictly necessary to ensure basic access right now. Therefore, this final push to get the bill through the House is most unfortunate, and it is not the outcome we had hoped for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395105">The NDP worked long days in good faith with other parties, but it is better than passing a flawed bill, defying the Supreme Court, and infringing on the charter rights of suffering Canadians, which prompted this legislative response in the first place. For us, this is not a partisan issue. We have collaborated with all parties from the start on this and will continue that constructive approach, especially when it comes to championing the causes for our health care and palliative care.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4395106">We had a chance to get this bill right, but the government does not seem interested in listening at this point. It is important here to step back and reflect on how we got to where we are now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395107">In February 2015, a unanimous Supreme Court ruling established the charter-protected right of competent adult Canadians experiencing enduring and intolerable suffering as a result of grievous and irremediable medical conditions, including a disease, disability, or illness, to access medical assistance in dying. In February 2015, the Supreme Court unanimously decided in Carter v. Canada that Canadians who are suffering intolerably because of a grievous and irremediable medical condition have a charter-protected right to access medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395108">The effect of the ruling was suspended until June 6, 2016. The reports of an interprovincial task force and a federal expert panel, as well as a wide array of witness testimony, were considered by a joint special committee of Parliament, resulting in 21 recommendations on a legislative response to Carter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395109">We succeeded in adding major actionable recommendations on palliative care to that report. This issue of palliative care is what, for myself, goes directly to what I object to most about Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> in its current state.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395110">Should the government rush into a bill like Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> without also having a plan to shore up and extend palliative care? The answer is, of course, most emphatically no, it should not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395111">As noted in the recent report by the Canadian Cancer Society, “Right to Care: Palliative care for all Canadians”, there are gaps in palliative care across the country. As my colleague mentioned in her speech, it is very heart-wrenching to know some of the stats and facts about what is actually available right now in palliative care for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395112">It is an epic fail for the government to be putting forward a bill while at the same time ignoring the real tangible details that we need to give us confidence as we move forward in a future with medical-assisted dying. That was so insensitive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395113">About 45% of cancer patients die in acute care hospitals, even though most Canadians prefer to die at home. Not only are acute care settings more costly than dedicated palliative care, they are also not equipped to provide the most appropriate care to palliative care patients and their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395114">Palliative care can increase the efficient use of our public health care dollars, but increased care outside of a hospital setting can place undue financial hardship on family caregivers. Health care costs tend to increase substantially in the months and weeks before death, due to increasing frailty and dependence on health care services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395115">We believe that the government should take a lead in providing appropriate funding for palliative care. Improving palliative care in all settings, including outside the hospital, should result in a more efficient use of health care dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395116">However, there will be upfront costs to facilitate change. Federal, provincial, and territorial governments should work together to establish a financing plan, and create a national palliative care transition fund to ensure the changes needed to improve palliative care in Canada can take place.</ParaText>

However, as we know, not a single dollar was earmarked for palliative care measures. We should have fortified health care, palliative care, home care before we crafted Bill C-14.

              <ParaText id="4395124">Mr. Speaker, just to pick up on the member's last point, there are many things I could talk about but we recognize within the Government of Canada, the Liberal Party, how important palliative care is. I used to be a health care critic in the Province of Manitoba. I am very much familiar with the needs of palliative care. It is important that we recognize that the best way to deliver palliative care is in co-operation with the province and the many different stakeholders. It goes even beyond government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395125">One of the initiatives that this government has taken responsibility for in terms of providing good strong leadership is the idea of working with the different provincial and territorial ministers of health in order to achieve a new health care accord. By doing that, we are that much more able to provide the type of palliative care that Canadians want to see in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395126">My question for the member is this. Does she not believe that it is important for the federal government not only to make the financial commitment that it has made, which is billions of dollars, but that it is equally important that we work with the stakeholders so that Canadians will get the best possible palliative care system in the world; and that can only be achieved if the federal government is prepared to show leadership, which it has done, and we work with the provinces that are delivering our health care services?</ParaText>

We have all heard through assisted dying many stories from our constituents, who are very disconcerted. It is really scary for ordinary Canadians to read the text of a bill that could be passed tonight, and then to have almost platitudes, very ambiguous comforts about palliative care. That is where the problem is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395128">I do agree that it is very important, and I think maybe the hon. member misses my point that it should have been front-loaded. Those details should have come first, and then present the text for Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. That makes it that much easier for people to be able to accept. I know as recently as last week, I heard people who are heartbroken saying, “My father was in the hospital hallway for nine days before he passed away. What are you going to do about that? I don't want to hear any more about Bill C-14. What are you going to do about that?” My heart breaks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395129">It is not just that my heart breaks. I know now I have to show some federal leadership like all of us here. That needs to come first. It would be very easy for the current governing party to stand up with some real hard-core statements, not these ambiguous things that are meant to placate us and just sort of distract us from the issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395130">Where is this money? Recommit to the Canada health accord. Enforce the Canada Health Act when it comes to home care. You could make three bold statements right now that would change the whole atmosphere of this. That has been missed and that is what is highly frustrating. When it comes to working with other jurisdictions, yes you have to take federal leadership that is strong and true, and strong—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4395141">In a unanimous decision on February 6, 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada turned down the provision in the Criminal Code, giving Canadian adults who were mentally competent and suffering intolerably and enduringly the right to a doctor's help in dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395142">The court suspended its ruling for 12 months, with a decision taking effect in 2016, giving the government enough time to amend its laws. In January 2016, the court granted an additional four month extension to its ruling suspension.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395143">Until now, it is a crime in Canada to assist another person in ending their own life. As a result, people who are grievously and irremediably ill cannot seek a physician's assistance in dying and may be condemned to a life of severe and intolerable suffering. A person facing this prospect has two options: they can take their own life prematurely, often by violent or dangerous means, or they can suffer until they die from natural causes. The choices are cruel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395144">This enactment would amend the Criminal Code to, among other things: (a) create exemptions from the offences of culpable homicide, of aiding suicide and of administering a noxious thing in order to permit medical practitioners and nurse practitioners to provide medical assistance in dying and to permit pharmacists and other persons to assist in the process; (b) specify the criteria for eligibility, and the safeguards that must be respected, before medical assistance in dying may be provided to a person; (c) require that medical practitioners and nurse practitioners who receive requests for, and pharmacists who dispense substances further to, medical assistance in dying; provide information for the purpose of monitoring medical assistance in dying; authorize the minister of health to make regulations respecting that information; and, (d) create new offences for failing to comply with the safeguards, for forging or destroying documents related to medical assistance in dying, for failing to provide the required information and for contravening the regulations. This enactment also makes related amendments to other statues being affected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395145">We have reached to the final stage of debate in the House regarding the process, with hours of debate on Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395146">The biggest thing during these debates was the sense of compassion with which the House heard from members debating for their individual constituents. That is the reason the bill touched the hearts of not only the members of the House, but also the hearts of Canadian from coast to coast to coast. Now, when the bill has reached to its final stage, I appreciate and congratulate every member for actively participating in building the most important and valuable laws on assisted dying and also to the government for affording full opportunity to all members to be part and parcel of this delicate and important legislation.</ParaText>

Repeatedly they have indicated that we can count on provincial regulatory bodies, which will care for this and conscience protection will be guaranteed. However, as we have seen, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario and Saskatchewan have both indicated that there is an expectation on the part of their medical professionals to at least refer for the practice of physician-assisted suicide.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4395154">Mr. Speaker, we have all struggled with this very delicate and sensitive issue in light of the Supreme Court direction, which has left parliamentarians with the task of constructing a law that conforms with the Supreme Court case decision in the Carter case.

              <ParaText id="4395193">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to be able to speak to this bill, which follows in a long line of bills aimed at correcting the English version of <I>O Canada</I>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395194">I would first like to point out, primarily for the benefit of some Quebeckers and francophones outside Quebec, that the French version is really the first version of <I>O Canada</I>. The music was written by Calixa Lavallée and the lyrics were penned by Adolphe-Basile Routhier. One could say that the original version of <I>O Canada</I> is still the French version. Accordingly, when we talk about correcting the English version, we are really talking about correcting an adaptation of the French version.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395195">What is more, the English version of <I>O Canada</I> is not an exact translation of the French, but rather an adaptation. The message in both is more or less the same, but the English version is not a word-for-word translation of the national anthem in French. It is important to explain that for people who do not understand the language very well, and who might not fully understand what these changes consist of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395196">Again, for people wondering about the changes that will be made to the second line of the English version, the bill would change the words “all thy sons” to “all of us”. In other words, “the patriot love of thy sons” becomes “the patriot love of all of us”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395197">I wanted to clarify that for my colleagues and the people watching my speech who wanted more of an explanation about the French and English versions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395198">What is more, between 1880 and 1907, several attempts were made to translate Routhier's French version into English. It was the version composed by Robert Stanley Weir, a justice of the Exchequer Court of Canada, that would become part of popular culture. It was written in 1908 and sung during the 300th anniversary of Quebec City. The full version included the line “True patriot love thou dost in us command”. In 1914, that lyric was replaced with “True patriot love in all thy sons command”.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4395199">As I said in French, in 1914, the line that commenced with “True patriot love thou dost in us command” in <I>O Canada</I> was replaced with “True patriot love in all thy sons command”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395200">There is no clear answer as to why the change was made. A lot of people assume that because of the war, people wanted to make the English version of <I>O Canada</I> more patriotic, so they replaced those words. That is the most common explanation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395201">We now have a bill under the scrutiny of the House to again modify <I>O Canada</I> to make it more inclusive by replacing the words “all thy sons” with “all of us”. It is important to remember that women make up 50% of the population. Therefore, I think it is a good idea that our national anthem be more inclusive. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395202">Also, as I said to some of my colleagues, perhaps in 1914 there were not a lot of women in the army. However, now they are full members of the armed forces. If the original change was made because of the war, and the face of the army has now changed, I think that with respect to war and patriotism women should have the right to be included in our national anthem.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4395203">That is why it is important to move forward with this bill. There were a number of bills that have attempted to correct that problem in our national anthem. The first one I have noted was in 1984, so it is not the first time we have tried to change it. Now is the time. I do not think it is fair to wait another 32 years. We will be very discouraged if it takes another 32 years. It is the right time to do it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395204">We are in 2016. The Canadian population will understand why we want to make the change. It is not a big change, and there will not be a big difference in the national anthem, but the difference is significant for women all across Canada. That is why we should support this bill by my colleague for <Affiliation DbId="2609" Type="2">Ottawa—Vanier</Affiliation>. He did a really good job on it. My former colleague, Libby Davies, also worked on it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395205">It is the right time to do it. Let us make our national anthem inclusive. It is a good time to be singing the famous version with “true patriot love in all of us command”. I would be proud to sing it that way. It is what we should do, and I encourage all members of the House to make that change.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4395206">Madam Speaker, I am very proud to rise today to speak to bill <Document DbId="8068817" Type="4">C-210, </Document> an act to amend the National Anthem Act regarding gender. The bill proposes replacing the words “thy sons” in the English version of the national anthem, with the words “all of us”, in order to make it gender neutral. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395207">Before I continue, I would like to explain why I really wanted to discuss this important bill today. Originally, according to the Order Paper, today I was supposed to introduce my bill, Bill <Document DbId="8117672" Type="4">C-236</Document>, regarding credit card acceptance fees for Canadian businesses. Instead, my bill will be introduced for second reading on September 19, 2016.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395208">It was really a no-brainer for me to give up my place for my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214141" Type="2">Ottawa—Vanier</Affiliation>, as he courageously fights Lou Gherig's disease.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395209">During the first hour of debate on Bill <Document DbId="8068817" Type="4">C-210</Document>, I was really disappointed by the lack of empathy shown by our colleagues in the official opposition, who chose not to drop the debate and instead to force a second hour of debate for clearly political reasons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395210">There are times when we must set politics aside and show some humanity, compassion, and openness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395211">The sponsor of the bill, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214141" Type="2">Ottawa—Vanier</Affiliation>, has spent his entire career working tirelessly to promote justice for all, and I would like to highlight some of his remarkable achievements. His determination to introduce this bill yet again is just one example of his steadfast commitment to fairness. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395212">A staunch defender of human rights and strong advocate for official languages, he inspires every one of us. I first met my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="214141" Type="2">Ottawa—Vanier</Affiliation> when I became a member of the Standing Committee on Official Languages, and I had the great fortune to work alongside him. The status of official languages is an issue that matters very much to me too as the member for the Quebec riding of Rivière-des-Mille-Îles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395213">My colleague elucidated the reasons that justify the change, which I wholeheartedly support. There must be no gender bias in our national anthem. This is a change we need and want because, yes, esteemed colleagues, it is 2016.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395214">This bill holds personal meaning for me as the mother of four children, two boys and two girls. My children are the reason I became involved in politics. This is a dream I have always had for our country and my family. I want my girls to have the same opportunity to achieve their full potential as my boys.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395215">In my opinion, the words <I>in all thy sons command</I> may have reflected Canadian society in 1913, but our society has evolved considerably in the past century.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395216">When the lyrics of our national anthem were written, women could not vote for or against a bill. In fact, they could not vote at all. Before 1929, they were not considered persons. It is essential to modernize the words of our national anthem to reflect the social progress made by Canadian men and women. Again, this is 2016.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395217">For decades, the Government of Canada has been committed to promoting gender equality here at home and abroad. Many bills have been introduced to recognize the contribution of women who, alone or in groups, contributed to making Canada the strong, creative, and inclusive country that it is today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395218">I am not saying that we have achieved perfect gender equality in Canada, but we have quite certainly improved things. Our government remains determined to build a country where our boys and girls will be equal participants in all aspects of society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395219">Allow me to mention some of the measures taken by the Government of Canada to recognize the vital role played by the women who contributed to building our Canada of today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395220">In budget 2016, our government announced investments that will increase capacity at Status of Women Canada. In fact, a $23.3-million investment over five years beginning in 2016-17 will support local organizations working in gender equality and women's issues. These new funds will also support the creation of a dedicated research and evaluation unit within the agency to provide evidence-based, innovative research on women's issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395221">This year, we will be proudly celebrating the 100th anniversary of women's right to vote in Manitoba. This event gives us another opportunity to highlight the remarkable achievements of activists who have fought for women's equality and gender equality.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="20">(1820)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4395222">Canada's commitment to promoting gender equality and women's rights is central to our foreign policy and makes us proud. The <Affiliation DbId="214339" Type="4">Minister of Status of Women</Affiliation> announced in March 2016 before the UN Commission on the Status of Women that Canada is running for a seat on the commission for the 2017-21 term. This would allow our country to play an even greater role in creating a better future for women and girls in Canada and around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395223">The amendment that my hon. colleague is proposing would change only two words, but this small change would be a significant gesture that would ensure that women are no longer excluded from our national anthem. That is why it is important for me to allow my colleague to take my place so that he can present his bill, which is so important to him. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395224">As we prepare to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Confederation, our support for Bill <Document DbId="8068817" Type="4">C-210</Document> would give us an opportunity to ensure that this important national symbol continues to reflect our values and inspire pride and a sense of belonging in all Canadians. In 2017, at Canada's 150th birthday celebrations, I hope to hear a national anthem that reflects Canada's modern reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395225"> In closing, I would like to thank my hon. colleague for introducing this bill. By supporting it, we will send a clear message to Canadians and the entire world that we stand and will continue to stand for gender equality and that we value the significant contributions that women have made and continue to make to our country. It will serve as yet another example of the government’s resolve to promote the equality of all Canadians. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4395227">Madam Speaker, speaking to the private member's bill, I think all members in the House are thinking of the member in question, our friend, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214141" Type="2">Ottawa—Vanier</Affiliation>, who has brought this issue to the national consciousness on a couple of occasions, and cannot participate in a debate that he has helped to create. However, regardless of what side of the debate one is on or the issues raised in it, every member of this place, of Parliament, and here in the nation's capital, hold our colleague and friend in tremendously high regard. Our thoughts are with him in this debate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395228">I think of my short time as minister of veterans affairs. During the election, we had Victory over Japan Day, Victory in the Pacific, and the 70th anniversary of that important milestone. There is tradition that when an important commemoration event happens during an election, the minister will do the event but will invite other parties to be represented. I spent a day with my friend, the MP for Ottawa—Vanier, who was then a candidate. I fully expected him just to come to the cenotaph and do a speech after I did, meet with a few of the veterans, and then go back to his campaigning. He spent the entire day, right through to the dinner, thanking our veterans. We had Battle of Hong Kong veterans who had been prisoners of war, in ill health, and in their nineties. We had other veterans from the Pacific theatre. The member spent the entire day with them. He did not go back. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395229">I think of that moment often, because at the end of the day he said he was really tired in the campaign, that it was wearing him down. Months later, when he shared his news with the House, I thought back to that moment and how he was probably not feeling his best but did not sacrifice a minute away from thanking our veterans. I will cherish that memory with my friend from Ottawa—Vanier. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395230">Starting out with that remembrance of my friend, what is special about this place is that we can be friends and not necessarily agree on the debate he has brought here. However, as a parliamentarian, he has raised this issue. What I think is best served by the debate today is the fact that we are showing that Canada is not the country of 1880, when <I>O Canada</I> was first composed by an order of the lieutenant governor of Quebec for Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day. Anyone who follows that national celebration in Quebec might find some irony in the fact that our national anthem had its origin as a song for Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395231">These national songs, symbols, and issues are rooted in the time of our early country. When we look at some of them now, we can be very proud of the country that the men and women who built this place created. Therefore, while the words and the passions and the emotions of our early years as a young confederation can be looked back to, we should also respect the symbol's heritage heraldry from that time. That is why we bring to the debate that all members of the chamber promote fully the inclusion of all Canadians and the wonderful opportunity that our country represents. Our country is as free as it is because of equality between men and women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395232">There is irony, in that when the song was composed it was at a time when women could not sit in this place, yet a century later we are debating whether the words chosen at that time should be changed. That in itself highlights the fact that we have come a long way as a country. We still have a tremendous way to go, particularly with equality on corporate boards and on a number of issues that our past government looked at and the present government is looking at as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395233">It is wrong for a country to tread on its heritage and history, even when some of those heritage symbols, songs, and anthems may seem a little dated when looking at it through the lens of 2016. That is really what we have come to with a debate about our national anthem. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="30">(1830)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4395234">We are not debating composing that anthem today. We are celebrating the country that chose this anthem generations ago. It is much like the mace I am staring at. It is not a weapon that is used on the field of battle today, but when the first parliaments were formed in Britain, it was a symbol that the weapon was being placed on the table and that sides could debate in a democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395235">Do we discard our ties to the past, or do we learn by looking back at them? That is essentially the debate my friend from <Affiliation DbId="214141" Type="2">Ottawa—Vanier</Affiliation> has brought to us. We look at how we would craft a national anthem today. Whether in French or English, they were both written as a young country emerged a few years past 1812, before the Great War. Both the French and English versions of <I>O Canada</I> are deeply military in symbolism, whether it is sword, stand on guard, or true patriot love. These stir emotions, and they were meant to in a young country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395236">As someone who joined the Canadian Armed Forces at age 18, I heard that anthem played at my ceremony and my oath to Her Majesty the Queen, which some may feel is old fashioned. These are the ties I have to the same institution of the Canadian Armed Forces as my grandfather and, indeed, many of our great-grandfathers had.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395237">As we approach the 100th anniversary of the battle of Vimy Ridge, we should look back and recognize that our country has come a long way. What is interesting is that, when I took my oath to join the Canadian Armed Forces, I stood proudly alongside some tremendous female leaders who were leaving their high schools across the country and stepping up to serve their country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395238">Anthems, symbols, heraldry, and heritage are the connections we have to the past. We can learn now by looking at them, but we should be very reticent to change them, because they are part of our history. It is critical for us to learn from that history, but changing things to suit today, with respect to some of the early symbols of this country, is not a way we can show we have evolved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395239">We show we evolve by looking back and saying that at that time women did not have the vote. Thankfully, that has changed. Our country has modernized, but we still have the tie to these important rallying points for an early and young country that was emerging to the north of its great southern rival.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395240">In our debate here today, all MPs certainly want all Canadians to feel a part of the Canadian story, the celebration that is represented by our national anthem, by our flag, by the military colours of units, by badges, and by crests. These all have origins in the early days of our nation, but we should not substitute them in each generation. We should look back and see how our society might have changed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395241">This is a good debate if we can look at it from that perspective, if we can look back and say we take pride in our anthem and all it represents. We take pride in the symbols in this Parliament, in this very chamber; for example, our coats of arms. Countries do not change or alter these without considerable need for consideration. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395242">In this case, we have a situation where, if we start parsing lines of songs, we are not showing respect for the tradition and the heritage we have inherited. This in no way suggests that sticking to a historic root of a song means that one is not in favour of equality. I worry when people make that argument. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4395243">I know that, listening to my constituents, as many of my colleagues have, and certainly considering the origins of the song, we can stay with it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395244">However, I thank my friend from <Affiliation DbId="214141" Type="2">Ottawa—Vanier</Affiliation> for bringing this to the floor of the House.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4395245">Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise today in the House to speak to Bill <Document DbId="8068817" Type="4">C-210,</Document> an act to amend the National Anthem Act, particularly as the bill proposes to reword the anthem so that it finally has inclusive language in terms of gender.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395246">This is an important initiative put forward by the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="214141" Type="2">Ottawa—Vanier</Affiliation>. Along with members of my party, I want to acknowledge his tireless efforts over time to achieve this historic change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395247">This a change that we in the NDP are proud to support. I would like to acknowledge that this change was also proposed, over the years, by NDP members of Parliament such as Libby Davies and Svend Robinson.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395248">Like many efforts to achieve equality, we must also acknowledge the push that came from women outside of this place. Without their tireless campaigning and advocacy to make this change to these lyrics, it would not be possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395249">It is important to note that this change is symbolic. It is about making a line in the anthem more reflective of the fact that women and men are Canadians. It is about sending a message that we are not sons, but we are people. This is about adopting gender-neutral language, a practice that has been very important over the last few decades. In essence, it would allow us in the House to alter the language in our anthem and in a way catch up to the kind of changes in language we have seen over time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395250">In fact, during the 1970s, feminists Casey Miller and Kate Swift created a manual called <I>The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing</I>. It served to reform the existing sexist language that was said to exclude and even dehumanize women. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395251">This conversation led to important changes, like changing the words businessman or businesswoman to business person. It led to changing words like chairman or chairwoman to chair or chairperson. Policeman became police officer, stewardess became flight attendant, and the list goes on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395252">These changes matter. They send a signal to girls and young women that they can aspire to do anything. By changing our language, by moving from what is known as androcentric language and focus, we send a signal that we all share space in this world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395253">Feminists have argued that male terms contribute to making women invisible, that they obscure women's importance and distract attention from their or our existence. I also want to point out that changing this part of the anthem also means that the language would be inclusive of trans people, or people who identify as gender fluid. Changing the anthem in this way sends a signal that we can all be just as proud to love our country, and we should celebrate that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395254">However, we should not stop here. The anthem, as well as many of our national symbols, must be an accurate reflection of who we are. The reality is that there is much work to be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395255">We know that so many of our symbols are not reflective of our history of nation building, which is premised truly on colonization and the attack on first nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples; that we continue to live and work on unceded territories; that we continue to perpetuate racist attitudes and implement discriminatory policies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395256">We also know that, in many cases, our national symbols fail to reflect the racial and ethnic diversity of our country, or the fact that many people immigrated to Canada from around the world to help build the country of which we are so proud. We fail to recognize that, while many have come as immigrants and have made Canada their home, others have only been able to come as migrant workers, without access to the rights any citizen would have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395257">Therefore, much work remains to be done to make sure our national symbols—and symbols they are—are reflective of the kind of reality we all live in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395258">These are important conversations that people are already having on a day-to-day basis. I want to acknowledge the work of many who have taken part in the discussion around reconciliation and what reconciliation ought to mean. Those discussions also involved reforming and reshaping our national symbols.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="40">(1840)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4395259">I want to acknowledge that many activists have been critical of the concept of reconciliation, and recognize that in many cases the narrative around reconciliation, as it is used by some, is used to pacify, in their particular case, indigenous activists who are truly challenging the foundations of our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395260">I also want to acknowledge the many who have called for a very critical lens when it comes to discussions around our national symbols, as well as concepts of fairness and justice, and what that might mean for racialized Canadians in particular.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395261">Going back to the notion that today is about symbols, I also want to acknowledge that we in the NDP have made it clear that this is an important step, and changing that one sentence in our anthem is critical. However, it certainly is not enough when we are talking about achieving gender equality in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395262">We are at a historic time. We have a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who has identified as being a feminist. We have seen a government appoint a gender-equal cabinet. We have seen some very positive pronouncements when it comes to the recognition that injustices faced by women are injustices that require federal leadership. In particular, I am thinking of the commitment to a national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395263">The reality is that in order to make a difference in the lives of women, to make a difference in the daily lives of Canadian women, we need to go far beyond symbolism. We need to move to action. There are many ways in which we need the federal government to act and to take leadership to truly make a difference in the lives of Canadian women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395264">First and foremost is the area of violence against women. We know that while other kinds of violence have dropped over the last number of years, domestic violence continues to remain stagnant. We know that over the last number of years, in fact, statistics show that women continue to face intimate partner violence at the same rate, consistently, year after year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395265">We know that violence targeted against women also impacts women differently according to their identity. Sixty-six per cent of all female victims of sexual assault are young women under the age of 24. We know that indigenous women are four times more likely to be targeted in terms of violence than non-indigenous women. We know that 60% of women with a disability experience some form of violence in their lifetimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395266">The statistics go on. We know that in order to act on violence against women, there needs to be action at the federal level. I am proud to have worked with our party to propose a comprehensive national action plan to end violence against women, a comprehensive national action plan that we put forward in a motion in the last Parliament. We certainly hope that the Liberal government will not just talk about the need for a comprehensive national action plan, as we have heard, but more importantly, will implement that national action plan to end violence against women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395267">Another area that demands federal leadership is the area of economic injustice still faced by women. We know that on average Canadian women still only make 72 cents to the male dollar, but when we apply a racialized lens or even an immigrant lens to that reality, the numbers are even more stark. Racialized women who are also immigrants only earn 48.7 cents for every dollar a non-racialized man earns in Canada today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395268">In terms of violence or economic injustice or the ongoing discrimination that women face on a daily basis, whether it is on our streets, in our schools, in our institutions, we know that the reality is that there needs to be concrete action so that women can truly see a change in their daily reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395269">I also want to acknowledge the work that needs to be done in terms of child care and the work that needs to be done in terms of strengthening our social safety net to support women, whether it is in terms of employment insurance, health care, or acknowledging the importance of how a strong social safety net contributes to women's equality.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4395270">I will conclude by saying that, yes, while we are proud to support Bill <Document DbId="8068817" Type="4">C-210</Document>, an act to amend the National Anthem Act, we also ask that the government show leadership in that same vein and commit to concrete actions and concrete support in terms of funding to truly achieve equality for women in our country.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4395271">Madam Speaker, I have the honour to rise in the House today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="8068817" Type="4">C-210</Document>, an act to amend the National Anthem Act, which proposes changing the English version of the national anthem to make it gender neutral.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395272">The bill proposes replacing the words “thy sons” with “of us”. The third line, which now reads “true patriot love in all thy sons command” would be replaced by “true patriot love in all of us command”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395273">First, I would like to thank the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="1913" Type="2">Ottawa—Vanier</Affiliation> for introducing this important bill. His dedication to the principle of justice in general and gender equality in particular and his extraordinary courage are a source of inspiration and an example to us all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395274">The theme of this bill should be of interest to all Canadians, men and women, and I am very proud to talk about it. The hon. member noticed that the national anthem did not correspond to our society and values. His bill seeks to correct that contradiction and change the anthem so that it better reflects Canada's reality. What is more, and I am sure that everyone in the House will agree with me, we want a Canada that gives men and women an equal opportunity to participate in society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395275">I want to point out that the French and English versions of <I>O Canada</I> are quite different. The verses in the English version are not a literal translation of the French version. That is why Bill <Document DbId="8068817" Type="4">C-210</Document> is focused on the English version. The French version is already gender neutral.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395276">The French version of <I>O Canada</I> was written in 1880. The music was composed by Calixa Lavallée, and the words were written by Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier. The words of the French version have not changed in all this time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395277">The English version of <I>O Canada</I> was written later. The music is the same as the French version, but the words were written by Justice Robert Stanley Weir, in 1908. Many changes have been made to Mr. Weir's words since 1908.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395278">The first change dates back to 1913, and I would like to make a slight correction to what my hon. colleague from Abitibi said. When Mr. Weir changed the neutral words “true patriot love thou dost in us command”, he replaced them with “true patriot love in all thy sons command”. It is widely acknowledged that this change was made to honour the men who served in the armed forces on the eve of the First World War.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395279"> The 1913 version became the official English version of <I>O Canada</I> when the National Anthem Act was adopted in 1980. The words “in all thy sons command” may have reflected the Canada of 1913, but our country has changed considerably over the centuries. Nowadays, women participate in all facets of Canadian life, including our armed forces. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395280">On June 27, 1980, the National Anthem Act was adopted unanimously by the House of Commons and the Senate, and it received royal assent that same day. It is important to note that the parties agreed to limit debate on the National Anthem Act to one representative each because other changes to the lyrics of <I>O Canada</I> would be made through private members' bills. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395281">Prior to that arrangement, the House had considered a number of bills to adopt a national anthem, but all died on the Order Paper. Since 1980, 12 bills have been introduced in Parliament to make the English version of the national anthem gender neutral. All of them sought to change the words “thy sons”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395282"> Despite the fact that all of the bills were rejected or died on the Order Paper, support for the change grew. Last year, a bill identical to Bill <Document DbId="8068817" Type="4">C-210</Document> was rejected at second reading by a vote of 144 to 127. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="50">(1850)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4395283">Public support for making the national anthem gender neutral has also increased. A 2015 poll commissioned by the member for <Affiliation DbId="214141" Type="2">Ottawa—Vanier</Affiliation> and conducted by Mainstreet Technologies revealed that 58% of Canadians supported the amended wording proposed in Bill <Document DbId="8068817" Type="4">C-210</Document>. After 34 years and 12 bills, the time has come to return to the neutral meaning of the original 1908 version of the national anthem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395284">This change to our national anthem is long overdue. In fact, it is 36 years overdue. Its lyrics should have been changed when <I>O Canada</I> became our national anthem in 1980. I think it is appropriate to make this change now, and I hope all members of the House will agree.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395285">The idea of changing a national symbol can spark debate. People are reluctant to give up traditions. However, as I just said, <I>O Canada</I> has only been our official national anthem since 1980.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395286"> This year, 2016, marks the 100th anniversary of women's right to vote. Next year we will celebrate the 150th anniversary of Confederation. It would be nice if we stopped excluding women from their national anthem. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395287">Today I call on all members of the House to make up for lost time and support the changes proposed in Bill <Document DbId="8068817" Type="4">C-210</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395288">Last November, our government received a lot of attention and support throughout the world when it appointed an equal number of men and women to cabinet. At that time, our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> expressed his pride in appointing a cabinet that reflects Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395289">The hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214141" Type="2">Ottawa—Vanier</Affiliation> asked the following question: should a national symbol not be reflective of the people it is supposed to represent? I sincerely believe that our 42nd Parliament will answer him with a resounding yes.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4395290">Madam Speaker, the member who just spoke was very eloquent on his position. I am glad to be joining this debate. However, when joining a debate at this late an hour, everything that is smart and interesting has already been said, so I will try to add a viewpoint to the debate that I do not think has been shared too often.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395291">I actually conducted a poll in my riding asking my constituents how I should vote. I will provide some of that information to the House and some background as to how I will be voting on this matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395292">Other members have mentioned that this is not the first time this has been proposed. There have been 10 attempts since the 1980s to change the second line of the English version of the anthem for both personal and technical reasons. In the previous Parliament, Bill <Document DbId="6691453" Type="4">C-624</Document> was debated and considered on this matter. Therefore, successive Parliaments have spent ample time on this over the past few decades debating whether there should be a change to the national anthem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395293">In 2010, the previous Conservative government proposed this change in its throne speech, no less. When the member for <Affiliation DbId="56140" Type="2">York—Simcoe</Affiliation> spoke earlier in the debate, he alluded to the fact that even Weir's grandson had weighed in at that time and opposed a change to the national anthem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395294">I want to clear up one misconception that I heard earlier today. It has been raised in the public and in the House as well that somehow the Conservative caucus blocked this bill earlier in the month. I do not believe that is true. It was simply following the usual legislative practice, which is rather than adopting a special expedited process, we should have a fulsome debate on this subject. This would allow me an opportunity to rise in the House to speak to this on behalf of my constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395295">I know this will shock many members, but I was initially going to support this bill. I thought changing and adopting the words “in all of us command” would have returned the wording closer to the 1908 version by Mr. Justice Robert Stanley Weir. I thought that would be the correct thing to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395296">As an originalist, I would consider that a reasonable legislative amendment to our national anthem. When I approach all manners of legislation, I look at our Constitution. I am an originalist and I like to stay within the bounds of what our founders intended for us to do both in the Constitution and with the symbols that represent Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395297">Since the bill was first tabled and debated, I have heard loud and clear from my constituents in Calgary Shepard, through a poll I conducted both on my website and promoted online via my Facebook page. They are 87% opposed to this change. Accordingly, I will be voting against this bill, unless more of my constituents vote in this online poll and sway me the other way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395298">I received hundreds of comments. In emails and phone calls, people explained to me the reasons they thought their local member should vote against this bill. I am attuned to the fact that this is not just a vote that I have to exercise based on what I believe is best, using what I know, and the facts that are laid before me. However, I also represent my constituents and they have been very clear with me that they are opposed to this change. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395299">I am also mindful that a poll was conducted called “Sing 'all of us'” by Mainstreet. It is a 2016 national poll conducted by Mainstreet Research in May. It is true that it found that 62% of Canadians supported this change of wording from “all thy sons command” to “in all of us command”, its original English wording. It was indicated that it was quite possible that a great deal of the 38% that were greatly opposed to this happened to be in my constituency. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395300">I note that in the news release Mainstreet issued, it promoted the notion that Canadians supported a gender-neutral national anthem. However, if we actually look at the questions it put forward in its poll, the script very handily put into the report, it made no such argument and did not put forward questions asking whether there should be a gender-neutral national anthem. Instead, they asked the following two questions, which I will read. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395301">The first question was, “The original English Anthem uses the word US, the current version uses Thy SONS. Which version do you believe is most appropriate?” I actually used a question very similar to this to ask my constituents which version we should use. I took the 1908 version and the current version, put them side by side, and put in big bold text the changes that were going to be made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395302">The second question that Mainstreet used was, “There is a Private Members Bill in the House of Commons to restore the meaning of the original English Anthem. Do you agree or disagree that we should restore the original meaning and use the words 'in all of us command' instead of the words 'in all thy sons command' in the English O Canada?” Again, I do not see a single mention of gender neutrality being proposed. Those are questions about restoration and returning something to its original meaning in 1908, closer to the true original meaning of the anthem at the time.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="55">(1855)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4395303">Those are questions that ask Canadians whether changing a national symbol back to a previous version would be a good idea, not whether there is sufficient gender neutrality or parity in the language.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395304">As well, the promotional material used by Mainstreet in that poll does not match the questions asked by the firm. It has been used by proponents of this change. This poll has been used oftentimes. Canadians do support it massively, but what Canadians support is retaining our national symbols the way they are and keeping to our traditions as much as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395305">I also disagree with the argument made by many in the House, and outside, that the proposed change is to ensure the gender neutrality of the wording. I am not opposed to that in a general way, only in this particular case. That argument implies that the English language is incapable of allusions, allegory, imagery, metaphors, or irony, that somehow the English language is very static. We know that not to be a fact. Many members use allegory, metaphors, and irony in their speeches in the House, using words that 200 years ago had a completely different meaning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395306"> Andrew Coyne made this same argument in a <I>National Post </I> comment that appeared May 9, 2016 online, and wrote that if “all thy sons” ever meant “just the guys”, it does not do so now. I very much agree with him. It requires an extraordinary effort of obtuseness to claim that it does. I am using his words here. I am just quoting what he said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395307">After all, many of the same proponents of this view of the static meaning of words are also enthusiastic proponents of a legal theory called the “living tree” when approaching the law and a constitution. It is that a constitution that serves the basis of all laws in a country can be reinterpreted, endlessly at times, with new meaning, including new words being found in it, sentences being read into it and read into the law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395308">I am conscious that in Canada we accept that the English language does change. All languages are not static. They change with the times, and words take on new meaning. In the case of the anthem, I believe it is all-inclusive, and if it meant a very specific thing 100 years ago, it does not mean that necessarily today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395309">Before <I>0 Canada </I> was officially adopted in 1980 as the official anthem, we used <I>God Save the Queen</I>. Will we be changing that as well? It still remains our royal anthem in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395310">We have many national symbols, including coats of arms, mottoes, a national flag, official colours, the maple tree, the beaver, the national horse, our national sports, and the tartan. How many of these should we start to change, as well, to achieve some type of goal? Should we restore them to their original status of maybe 1967? How far do we need to go back to ensure gender neutrality? When is it appropriate to change these symbols of Canada? Is there a rush to change them? Does it not need fulsome debate? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395311">We have had 25 or 30 years of different individuals considering the matter and proposing changes to our different symbols. Our provinces and territories also have their own symbols, which residents of them cherish to various degrees. I am from Alberta, and back home we unofficially sing a tune called <I>Alberta Bound</I> by Paul Brandt as our anthem. I will provide a few lyrics from that song because it is so good:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4395320">Despite not being born in Alberta, those few lines speak to that deep, hard to explain, but easy to feel, sense of home and belonging that Alberta is to Albertans. It is an unofficial anthem. There is no act saying that it is an official symbol of Alberta, but those few simple lines give literary life to the feeling that every Albertan feels, wherever he or she is from originally, that we are truly only home when we are back in Alberta. I hope Paul Brandt keeps every single word exactly the way it is. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395321">Words do have meaning, and they do have a lot of power, and the original meaning especially has a lot of power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395322">My constituents, though, are really tied to the current version of the national anthem. I deeply respect the motivation of the mover of this motion, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214141" Type="2">Ottawa—Vanier</Affiliation>. He has offered us yet another opportunity to have vigorous debate on this topic. I salute his stamina and strength as he battles his illness. It is courageous to see a man like that who has such grace and power. It gives heart to people like me with kids with a chronic condition. They can do it too. They can outlast it as well. However, at the end of the day, I must listen to my constituents, who are vastly opposed to the bill. Canadians, in 2010, so strongly opposed the amendments to the national anthem, and I must vote against the bill.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4395323">Madam Speaker, I want to begin my remarks on this important bill by paying tribute to the work done by the member for <Affiliation DbId="214141" Type="2">Ottawa—Vanier</Affiliation>. Of course we can still have differences of opinion with respect to this bill. However, it is important to recognize his courage and commitment to a cause that we may not all agree with. Nonetheless, his willingness to absolutely preserve and put forward a principle that is important to him and reflects a long-term project of his is important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395324">I have to say that I have thought quite a bit about this bill. I know that during this debate some have taken the view that these things can never change. That is not my view. I am open to having a conversation about the wording and I believe that there is no harm in having that conversation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395325">In that context I will say that if we were to change the words, I would personally prefer the original version of “thou dost in us command” over “all of us command”, which I regard as somewhat awkward phrasing. This perhaps illustrates the point that ultimately this is not quite a binary choice. Members of the Canadian public might ultimately wish to make some kind of a change but have a range of different perspectives on what the best kind of change would be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395326">However, I have concerns about the process. I will be voting against the bill, principally because, and this is perhaps the only case wherein I would tell the government it needs to do much more consultation on this. I do not think two hours of debate on a private member's bill is the appropriate process of pushing through a change that is this consequential to our national anthem. It seems perhaps strange that I would say that, given on so many files we make the opposite criticism of the government, that it seems to be dragging out and punting down the road decisions that could be taken much more quickly. Then on other files, and particularly in this case, there is a will it seems to expedite this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395327"> In fact, there was some criticism in the media about Conservative members who wanted to complete the first hour and continue to a second hour. There were members of the government who felt that we should just let the debate shut down and have the vote right then. I think that is fundamentally irresponsible. I understand the desire to move this along because of the health situation of the member for <Affiliation DbId="214141" Type="2">Ottawa—Vanier</Affiliation>, however, I think we would give him a better tribute if we give this the thorough discussion, and engage in the necessary conversations and consultations with Canadians as part of that important process. Therefore, I would make a modest proposal. If the government wants to have this discussion, if it wants to have Canadians engaged in this discussion, why not have this as the second question on the electoral reform referendum that we think certainly needs to happen and we hope will be happening?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395328">If members of the government are eager to have this conversation, I just do not think we should be rushing this in through the vehicle of a private member's bill. I also do not think that prescribing specific new wording is the way to go instead of having a conversation that engages Canadians and then ultimately puts the question to Canadians. I believe that a process that engages Canadians in the discussion would be more effective because it seems to me there are likely many Canadians who do not even know that we are having a conversation this consequential about changing our national anthem. I know that some members have talked, and my friend from Calgary Shepard in particular, about the significant engagements they have had with their constituents on this issue. However, I suspect all the same that there are many Canadians who are not following the debates in this place in detail. They would be surprised to find that in a few short months all of a sudden they are told that the anthem that they have been singing from childhood has been changed. I think that would be a surprise and a very unfortunate way of rushing this important conversation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4395329">The language contained in this type of an anthem obviously is important. It has symbolic value for Canadians on both sides. It has symbolic value to those who may not feel included by the words, but on the other hand, they may not be interpreting the original connotation of those words in the correct way, but still may not feel included by them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395330"> On the other hand, there are those who have identified with that anthem, have fought for Canada under that anthem, and would feel the opposite, would feel that moving away from wording that they have historically identified with and appreciated would be really troubling for their sense of patriotism, troubling in their desire to identify with long-standing Canadian symbols.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395331">We can do this. If members in the government are interested in having this discussion, it could be done in a responsible way. However, in the absence of that process and in the absence of the proper engagement with Canadians, I am forced to oppose the bill.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="214382" Type="2">Ms. Elizabeth May (Saanich—Gulf Islands, GP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4395344">Madam Speaker, it is my honour this evening to take up a question I originally asked the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> on the subject of the Paris accord on climate change. I asked him if he was planning to attend the April 22 United Nations meeting at which the Paris accord would be open for signing. However, the second part of my question, which is still relevant, is whether we would be presenting more robust targets at that occasion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395345">It is entirely my pleasure to report that of course the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> did personally attend the United Nations General Assembly. It was a record breaker for the United Nations system that on the first day open for official signing of a treaty, for the first time ever, more than 174 countries signed on one day. It was wonderful that our Prime Minister and our <Affiliation DbId="214310" Type="4">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation> were both present. To give it context, there are 195 countries that have confirmed that they will be signing, so every country on earth is committed to this agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395346">A lot of people watching these debates may wonder what the Paris accord would accomplish. This is what I want to focus upon in the time remaining. It is either an agreement that is an enormous success, or it is a sham. I believe it will be an enormous success. However, in order to succeed in achieving the long-term target, which is to ensure that global average temperature rise does not exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius—what they were before the industrialized revolution. In order to achieve that, we need to have very robust action plans from every government. The Secretary General of the United Nations, on that occasion of the signing ceremony in the UN General Assembly headquarters, said that the window of opportunity to avoid a rise of 1.5 degrees is closing very rapidly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395347">Crunching the numbers, as scientists do, they look at all of the targets. They are now referred to as intended nationally determined contributions, or INDC. They take the aggregate of all those targets, and assuming every country is going to meet its target, what is the impact? Do we avoid 1.5 degrees? Do we hold it to less than two degrees? The horrible truth is that the range of global average temperature increase takes us well past the danger zone and potentially into the area that scientists do not want to talk about—a runaway global warming, where the amount of anthropogenic warming triggers a non-stop warming effect globally. Planetary disaster and catastrophic impacts would ensue. The range, if every country achieves its targets, is 2.7 to 3.5 degrees Celsius global average temperature increase.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395348">Currently, Canada's INDC is that left behind by the previous government, which is why I raised this with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and raise it again tonight with the parliamentary secretary. It is quite clear that Canada showed leadership at COP21 in Paris. Canada again showed leadership in signing on the opening day and in the Prime Minister's rather prominent role in that signing ceremony. Now we have to show leadership by withdrawing the INDC that is currently tabled, left by the previous government, of 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. It is far weaker than that of our U.S. partners. The Barack Obama administration has an end date of 2025. It is my absolute contention and assertion, and in fact I am begging the government to change our target to coincide with that of the U.S. At least advance it to close by 2025. Then as the Paris agreement goes through global stock-taking, we will be reviewed in concert with the U.S.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4395349">Madam Speaker, I would like to start by acknowledging the party leaders, the provincial and territorial leaders, the indigenous leaders, and members of Canadian civil society who came together from across the country and participated constructively in the negotiations in Paris just a few short months ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395350">Our government very intentionally adopted an inclusive approach to these important negotiations in order to send a clear message to the international community: one, that Canada takes the threat of climate change very seriously, and two, that climate change should very much be a non-partisan issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395351"> As the hon. member, I too am very proud of the leadership role that Canada, its <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, its <Affiliation DbId="214310" Type="4">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation>, and its entire delegation, played in Paris.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395352">Maintaining the momentum established in Paris has been, and will continue to be, very important. A key first step in this regard will be to ensure that the Paris agreement is brought into force as soon as possible. As the member opposite is aware and as she acknowledged, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> signed the Paris agreement on behalf of Canada at the United Nations headquarters in New York City on April 22. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395353">Domestically, what is most important now is how Canada works to develop and implement specific policies to address greenhouse gas emissions and clean growth. This government takes the commitments made in Paris very seriously. We are presently working on a detailed strategy that will enable us to ensure that we meet or exceed our currently stated target.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395354">Given the decade of complete inaction on climate change that we experienced under the previous government, Canada has made virtually no progress over the past decade with regard to addressing greenhouse gas emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395355"> In fact, if one looks at Canada's projected emissions profile in 2030, taking into account actions taken at provincial and municipal levels to date, we are projected to have emissions of approximately 9% above 2005 levels by 2030, versus the current target of 30% below 2005 levels. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395356">Given the lack of progress in the 10 years since the previous Conservative government established the 30% below 2005 target, this target now represents a highly ambitious goal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395357"> In terms of a climate plan for Canada, as the hon. member is aware, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> met with premiers from the provinces and territories to discuss climate change and what Canada must do to achieve its target. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395358">The Vancouver declaration established a framework for the development of a detailed plan as to how Canada will begin the transition to a stronger, more resilient, low-carbon economy. As first ministers agreed at that time, we will promote clean and innovative economic growth that creates jobs for Canadians; we will ensure that carbon pricing exists; and we will invest in both adaptation and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. First ministers will meet this fall to finalize that plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395359"> We have also taken action with the Americans on a number of fronts, specifically with respect to reducing methane emissions to 40% below 2012 levels by 2025.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395360">Canadians recognize the enormous strides that have been taken on this file over the past number of years. In my mind we have a moral imperative to get this right for our children and our grandchildren. We also have an economic imperative to get this right to ensure a strong and robust Canadian economy continues to thrive as we move toward a lower carbon future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395361">I am proud to be part of a government that is demonstrating strong leadership, globally and domestically. I am also pleased to be part of a government that is desirous of engaging Canadians of all political stripes in this important conversation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395362">I know that the hon. member opposite cares deeply about this issue, as do I, and that she has many thoughtful things to say regarding these issues. I look forward to working with her to ensure that we are collectively successful on this very important file.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4395363">Madam Speaker, of course I do not disagree with a single thing that the parliamentary secretary said about the last 10 years. In fact, I would go further and say that in 2005, the previous government of the Right Hon. Paul Martin had in place a plan that would have taken us very close to Kyoto targets, which was immediately cancelled by the previous Prime Minister when he took office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395364">That is still not good enough. It will not be enough for the new Liberal government to be much, much better than the previous government. We actually have to do what is necessary, and what is necessary to avoid 1.5°C means not just drilling down domestically into how we almost meet or meet the targets of the previous government. By withdrawing our INDC and tabling a new one that is more robust, that is more ambitious, we can trigger other countries to do the same. Otherwise we will lock in global average temperature increases way past the danger zone.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4395366">In the context of the Canadian federation, part of what we actually have to do is work collaboratively with the provinces that hold many of the key metrics and the key tools with which we can actually get at some of the key sources of emission, so the process that we established as part of the Vancouver declaration is to work collaboratively with the provinces to work toward an outcome that we will all be happy with. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395367">As I said when I spoke a few minutes ago, the focus for us is on meeting or exceeding those targets, and we are working on a collaborative basis with the provinces to ensure that, on a pan-Canadian basis, we have a plan to do that.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4395368">Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to rise at this point and further challenge the government on its lack of emphasis on international human rights. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395369">I am following up on a question that I asked in March, where I, or we, called on the government to renew the important work then being done by Canada's office of religious freedom. Of course, we know now that the government most likely did not have any plan at the time, but certainly was not prepared to renew the work of the office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395370">In the intervening time, the office expired in March. We spent a month and half with absolutely no plan. The government was not prepared to even extend the work of the office of religious freedom for the interim period of time until it came up with what it is notionally identifying as a replacement structure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395371">There was not a plan. There was not a willingness to do anything in the interim. I think that left a real problem for many of the stakeholders who are involved in this area, as well as our international partners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395372">Now we finally know what the government's much-promoted, at least by it, new replacement strategy is. It has come up with what it is calling an office of human rights, freedom, and inclusion, what we have dubbed an office of everything. If we look at the words of the minister and others, this office promises to do absolutely everything in this context.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395373">In a conversation the minister had with the <I>National Post</I>, he talked about it being involved in promoting the rights of indigenous peoples around the world, certainly something that is important, as well as dealing with the Canadian mining industry, and dealing with how indigenous rights internationally might interact with it. Again, it is an important area, to be sure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395374">The minister talked as well about this office dealing with freedom of religion in the context of the subdivision of inclusion within the office. However, then he said that inclusion was not only freedom of religion; it could be sexual inclusion. I am not entirely sure what that means, but we will just move on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395375">It could be political exclusion, pluralism, rights of women, rights of refugees, and in the midst of aiming at dealing with almost every problem, it is not at all clear what this office will do. As we learn more, it is particularly concerning that this office is not really an independent office at all, certainly not in the sense that we once had with the office of religious freedom. This is not an independent office with an ambassador. It is in fact aligned within foreign affairs and is headed up by a director. If the government took this area seriously, it would at least appoint an ambassador to be responsible for this important area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395376">I will just mention as well that there is no mention in the budget of this work, of course again suggesting that the government is flying by the seat of its pants on this, but also making us wonder where the money for this is going to come from. If this comes from internal reallocation from other existing human rights activities, we are clearly no better off.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395377">If the government was serious about international human rights, it could have maintained the existing office of religious freedom and certainly built on that existing model to explore creating other small, focused offices to deal with some of the other very worthy areas that are mentioned. I certainly think there is some value in looking at the area of international rights of indigenous peoples, but the government does not do that area or religious freedom or anything else justice by lumping it together in this ostensibly mandateless soupy office of everything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395378">I want to ask the government this question again. Is it willing to do the responsible thing, use the model that worked, and renew the office of religious freedom?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4395379">Madam Speaker, I am happy to share with the hon. member, again, the government's plan for defending human rights. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395380">Canada stands in solidarity with anyone who faces oppression, including a threat to life, due to their beliefs. The government has taken significant steps to ensure that the important work of defending freedom of religion, or belief effectively, is included in our broadened approach to champion peaceful pluralism, respect for diversity, and human rights as a whole. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395381">The promotion and protection of human rights, including freedom of religion or belief, as well as the right to not believe, is an integral part of Canada's constructive engagement in the world. Our government is committed to doing more in the promotion and protection of human rights, which are indivisible at home and abroad. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395382">As part of this commitment to human rights, on May 17, 2016, the hon. <Affiliation DbId="214305" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> announced the creation of the office of human rights, freedoms, and inclusion. The new office expands on the work undertaken by the former office of religious freedom by bringing these efforts together in an approach that includes all human rights. The hon. member is quite right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395383">I am proud to say that all Canadian heads of mission will make the promotion of human rights, freedoms, and inclusion part of their core objectives. Canada's permanent representatives to the United Nations in New York City and Geneva will have a clear mandate for the advancement of human rights. This is a key component of Canada's renewed engagement with the United Nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395384">As well, the budget dedicated to the promotion of human rights, including freedom of religion or belief, will be $15 million, which is three times the amount originally committed to the former office of religious freedom. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395385">The integration of freedom of religion or belief within a human rights framework provides Canada with enhanced ways to advocate for all rights and freedoms, including the rights of women and children, refugees, indigenous peoples, sexual minorities, and the freedom of religion or belief, for example. It reflects our enhanced effort to advance peaceful pluralism, respect for diversity, and inclusion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395386">The office of human rights, freedoms, and inclusion does more to enrich our societies by including those often marginalized in civic engagement and public discourse, regardless of their place of birth, mother tongue, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or beliefs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395387">There is much to improve upon in the field of human rights. Here at home and abroad, the Government of Canada is working continuously to promote positive change. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4395388">Madam Speaker, it is mystifying that the government wants this new office of everything but cannot answer some very simple questions about it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4395389">I would like to hear from the parliamentary secretary what this office will actually do. I would like to know why this office is not a real independent office, in the same sense as the previous office. Why is there not an ambassador who has the ability to speak and raise issues in a clear public way? Is this new money, or is this just the product of internal reallocation, potentially away from existing human rights activities?</ParaText>
