              <ParaText id="4727834">Mr. Speaker, this past December, the Prime Minister announced that Canadian Arctic waters were indefinitely off limits to future offshore oil and gas licensing. Although this decision is undoubtedly beneficial to the northern environment, it must be balanced with the needs of Nunavummiut. Implementing offshore oil and gas could generate new-found economic opportunities for Nunavut, creating jobs and own-source revenues that could be used toward improving the third world living conditions that currently exist in our territory.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4727835">Engaging in real consultations with Nunavut on issues such as this regarding territorial self-sustainability is part of the devolution process that Nunavummiut want and expect from the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4727836"> As a result of this lack of consultation, the Government of Canada has taken away a potential source of revenue for Nunavut. This issue will need to be addressed and seriously considered during devolution talks. </ParaText>

This was our best attended round table yet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4727843">January saw the introduction of a provincial carbon tax in Alberta. My riding in January is a cold place, and people rightly saw the injustice of a tax on home heating fuel and a tax on families who need to use a car because they cannot walk their kids to the grocery store. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4728128">I submitted a 10-part question to the Order Paper on September 27, 2016. I received an itemized response from the Global Affairs, International Development and la Francophonie, and International Trade ministries in November to only three parts of my question that were itemized on the answer. These were sections e, i, and j, and they were satisfactory in my view. I do not contest the quality of the answer I have received thus far. I have waited this long, expecting a supplementary tabling this past Monday and Tuesday to provide answers to subsections a, b, c, d, f, g, and h. That supplementary answer has not been forthcoming, and therefore I am rising on this point of order today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728129">I am not asking you, Mr. Speaker, to review the quality or accuracy of the response. I am asking you to address the lack of a response to parts of my Order Paper question duly submitted at the time and found to be in proper form by the clerk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728130">Given that information on the construction of the wall outside of the Westin Hotel exists, it must be provided to the people of Canada. That is why I asked for the government to do so through this very specific use of the Order Paper question, to which the government is bound by parliamentary tradition as old as our country to respond to. The government has not responded to the whole of my question, and therefore it falls to you, Mr. Speaker, as the presiding officer of this House, to ensure that Standing Orders are upheld and that the questions be fully answered and the government be held to account for its seemingly preferential treatment of foreign Chinese officials.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4728153">Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that NDP members, who claim to care about this issue, would co-operate in this fashion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728154">I propose to them another option. My House leader has circulated a motion to all parties, and I hope you will find unanimous consent for the proposal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728155">The motion separates out the supervised injection sites section of the bill. It also adopts at all stages the remaining parts of the bill. We are also willing to allow the supervised injection sites section of the bill to go to committee today, without the need for time allocation. I know the members across would like that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728156">Therefore, I ask for unanimous consent of the House for the following motion. I move that Bill <Document DbId="8689350" Type="3">C-37, an act to amend the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and to make related amendments to other acts</Document> be divided into two bills: Bill C-37(A), an act to amend the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and to make related amendments to other acts (supervised consumption sites), and Bill C-37(B), an act to amend the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and to make related amendments to other acts; that Bill C-37(A) be composed of clause 26(6), new section 31(1.1); clause 26(7), revised section 31(8); clause 40(6), revised section 55(1)n; clause 40(14); clause 40(15); clause 41, and clause 42; that Bill C-37(B) be composed of all the remaining parts of Bill C-37; that the Law Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel be authorized to make any technical changes or corrections as may be necessary; that the House order the printing of bills C-37(A) and C-37(B); and that Bill C-37(A) be placed on the Order Paper for consideration of the House at second reading and referral to the Standing Committee on Health; and Bill C-37(B) be deemed to have been read a second time and referred to committee of the whole, deemed considered in committee of the whole, deemed reported without amendment, deemed concurred at report stage, and deemed read a third time and passed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728157">If we can get together and unanimously make these changes, we can start saving lives today, instead of having to go through procedural shenanigans. It would make a real difference to Canadians. I think we would all like to co-operate on that. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4728162">Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the excellent member for <Affiliation DbId="214258" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728163">I thank the House for allowing me to speak today on Bill <Document DbId="8689350" Type="3">C-37</Document>, an act to amend the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and to make related amendments to other acts. Before I get into the substance of Bill <Document DbId="8689350" Type="3">C-37</Document>, I would like to remind the House of some of the events that occurred before it was introduced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728164">In 2011, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the federal government must grant Vancouver's safe injection site, Insite, and other such sites section 56 exemptions under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act in order to uphold the fundamental right of all people to life and security. The Supreme Court added that safe injection sites will “decrease the risk of death and disease, and there is little or no evidence that [they] will have a negative impact on public safety”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728165">In response to this decision by Canada's highest court, the then Conservative government finally tabled Bill <Document DbId="6254806" Type="3">C-2</Document> in 2015. With the thinly veiled intent of not allowing new supervised injection sites to open, the government put in place 26 conditions for obtaining a legal exemption, making it virtually impossible to open new centres.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728166">As if that were not enough, the bill also gave discretionary power to the minister responsible to refuse to grant the legal exemption even if the 26 conditions were met. I always maintained that it would not be possible to obtain an exemption given the number of requirements already imposed by the law. However, this discretionary power proves that the Conservatives were not going to allow, under any circumstances, new centres to open.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728167"> I sat on the committee and heard witnesses, with supporting evidence, describe the benefits of injection sites, including harm reduction and public health, and tell us that public safety would not be jeopardized.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728168">By refusing to consider clear and compelling evidence that supervised injection sites save the lives of many very vulnerable people, the Conservatives and their ideological approach only continued to marginalize and criminalize people suffering from addiction. This unfortunately also resulted in overdoses and deaths that could have been prevented.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728169">A serious opioid crisis is plaguing the country, particularly the west coast, as my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="213868" Type="2">Vancouver Kingsway</Affiliation>, our health critic, has repeatedly stated here in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728170">In 2016, in British Columbia alone, opioid overdoses took the lives of 914 people, 80% more than in 2015. In April, the situation prompted B.C. public health authorities to declare a state of emergency for the first time in the province's history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728171">Although we do not have statistics for the number of overdose-related deaths in Canada, it is estimated to have been over 2,000 across the country in 2015. It is easy to imagine the death toll in 2016 being much higher because of the rapid spread of extremely powerful opioids across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728172">Overdoses and drug-related deaths are on the rise in every part of the country, and the crisis is expected to hit Ontario and Quebec this year. The opioid crisis in Canada is now officially out of control.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728173">One of the main reasons the crisis is mounting is that fentanyl is cheap and easy to transport, and just a small amount can be used to make thousands of doses. Because this drug is so cheap, and because too few resources are invested in raising awareness and prevention, young and inexperienced users are overdosing. In many cases, they do not even know that there is fentanyl in the drug they are using.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728174"> In February 2016, when the crisis was emerging, the New Democratic Party called for the repeal of Bill <Document DbId="6254806" Type="3">C-2</Document> to make it easier for organizations to get legal exemptions to open supervised consumption sites. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728175">Last fall, the NDP got the Standing Committee on Health to study the opioid overdose crisis. In its report, the committee made 38 recommendations to the federal government.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="20">(1620)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4728176"> We were also the first to request that a national public health emergency be declared in order to give the Chief Public Health Officer of Canada the authority to take extraordinary measures in order to coordinate a response to the opioid crisis, including the creation of injection sites on an emergency basis. Last December, after Bill <Document DbId="8689350" Type="3">C-37</Document> was introduced, we also tried to have the bill fast-tracked in order to resolve the crisis as quickly as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728177">The Liberals say they support supervised injection sites, and yet their government has not approved a single new facility since coming to power. In fact, the <Affiliation DbId="214328" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> initially argued that legislative changes to Bill <Document DbId="6254806" Type="3">C-2</Document> were not even necessary, even though the real problem was with the bill itself, with its 26 separate requirements acting as effective barriers to any new sites, as had been pointed out by stakeholders and the NDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728178">Faced with the growing crisis across the country and mounting pressure from stakeholders and the NDP, the <Affiliation DbId="214328" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> finally gave in and, on December 12, 2016, introduced Bill <Document DbId="8689350" Type="3">C-37</Document>, which we are debating here today. Specifically, the bills seeks to simplify the process for applying for a legal exemption so that communities dealing with the opioid crisis can actually open supervised injection sites.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728179">In the preamble, the bill states: </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4728181">It is in the context of harm prevention that the City of Montreal and the public health authority officially submitted their application for legal exemption in May 2015 for three fixed services in three neighbourhoods and one mobile service. They are still awaiting. It is not surprising. Not a single supervised consumption site has opened in Canada since Bill <Document DbId="6254806" Type="3">C-2</Document> was passed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728182">We are not the only ones calling for the government to move forward with implementing injection services.

Opening these centres could do much to decrease the incidence of disease related to the use of syringes.

The suffering and damage this crisis is causing, not just in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, the epicentre of the crisis, but in Vancouver East and cities across British Columbia and Canada, is absolutely devastating.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728211">I am very grateful for the Herculean efforts of first responders, front-line workers, medical practitioners, family members, advocates, and activists who have and are continuing to work tirelessly to save lives in the midst of this terrible crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728212">People are dying in our communities. Both the city of Vancouver's chief medical health officer, Dr. Patricia Daly, and the provincial health officer, Dr. Perry Kendall, have declared this crisis a medical health emergency. In fact, this is the first time in the history of British Columbia that a health emergency has been declared.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728213">It was noted by Dr. David Juurlink, head of clinical pharmacology and toxicology at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, that the number of overdose deaths across Canada has vastly outpaced the toll during the 2003 SARS crisis that gripped this country and was declared an emergency by the Ontario government. He stated, “Forty-four people died of SARS. We lose 70 people a week to opioids in Canada”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728214">Still, the federal <Affiliation DbId="214328" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> has refused to declare this a national health emergency. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728215">From the beginning of 2016 to October 2016, 338 Albertans died from an apparent drug overdose related to opioids. Fentanyl was involved in 193 of them. Two Ontarians die from opioid overdoses a day. An average of 79 people die of drug overdoses every year in Montreal. If this is not a national health emergency, I do not know what is. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728216">Today I am here once again urging the government to do what is right and what is necessary: declare a national public health emergency. Let us remember as we debate Bill <Document DbId="8689350" Type="3">C-37</Document> that people in communities across the country are still dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728217">Bill <Document DbId="8689350" Type="3">C-37</Document> came on the heels of an announcement by the B.C. government, which was no longer willing to wait for federal approval and decided that it would take “the extraordinary measure” of signing a ministerial order making the provincial operation of temporary overdose prevention sites legal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728218">For those who want to put up roadblocks to harm reduction initiatives, including supervised injection facilities, I say this. It has been more than a decade since Insite, the first supervised injection facility in North America, was established. There has not been one single overdose death in that facility. Insite has saved countless lives. It has reduced the spread of diseases. The evidence is clear, and it is irrefutable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728219">Van East led the way, and I am so proud of the progressive forces and the movement in a community that cares so deeply that it took this issue and drove it until we had the first supervised injection facility in North America.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728220">I still recall vividly the imagery of 1,000 crosses planted at Oppenheimer Park in our community, what we call the killing fields. Each one of those crosses bears a name, the name of a person who somebody loved in our community, a daughter, a son, an aunt, an uncle, somebody's child. I still recall how family and friends came together and mourned those preventable deaths. It was a call to action, and we drove the issue and eventually Insite was established.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728221">It is sad to me that despite this irrefutable evidence-based outcome, there are still those who want to block this critical health measure.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4728222">The former government took every step possible to undermine the work of Insite. Even after the Supreme Court of Canada's 9-0 decision that ordered the government to exempt Insite from prosecution, stating clearly that the government cannot close Insite because of its ideology, the Harper government passed Bill <Document DbId="6254806" Type="3">C-2</Document>, the ill-named Respect for Communities Act, which introduced near insurmountable barriers to opening new supervised injection sites in Canada. The roadblocks have been widely condemned and no doubt have contributed to preventable deaths.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728223">After more than a year of foot-dragging, thousands of overdoses, and hundreds of needless deaths, the Liberal government today is finally bringing in measures to address the ideological relic of the years past. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728224">While I support Bill <Document DbId="8689350" Type="3">C-37</Document>, to be clear, I would much rather that the bill was about repealing Bill <Document DbId="6254806" Type="3">C-2</Document>. Nonetheless, this is a move in the right direction. It is a step forward, so I am here to support it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728225">Bill <Document DbId="8689350" Type="3">C-37</Document> has to get through the House, then it has to be sent to committee, then has to go to the Senate. It will be some time before the bill passes. I want to applaud my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="213868" Type="2">Vancouver Kingsway</Affiliation>, the NDP's critic for health. His proposal to try to get the bill through all stages as quickly as possible, sadly was rejected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728226">Many concerned citizens and organizers are so frustrated by the glaring absence of substantive action on this that they have felt compelled to act unilaterally with pop-up supervised injection sites. Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. This is a testament to those individuals' courage and dedication to saving lives in our community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728227">Let me take a moment to thank them and acknowledge the numerous volunteers and activists; the leadership shown by Ann Livingston and her peers at VANDU; Sarah Blyth, the former Vancouver Park Board chair; and many others for their incredible dedication and caring. Were it not for their efforts, I can say with confidence that many more people would have died.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728228">In going forward, as we wait for Bill <Document DbId="8689350" Type="3">C-37</Document> to become law, what action can be taken to save lives? Let me start with a shout-out to all the tireless first responders for their incredible efforts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728229"> I heard first-hand from firefighters about their experiences in this crisis, particularly from those men and women at Fire Hall No. 2, with the incredible overload of calls that came into that hall and the stresses firefighters had to face each and every day as they had to witness death. Imagine that as their work every single day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728230">It is not limited to Fire Hall No. 2 in my riding. In fact, all the other fire halls in my community across East Van have had an increase in calls with respect to overdose challenges and issues. I heard from firefighters who told me that during their shifts, sometimes they would have two, three, four, or more calls to go out and try to save lives. That is what they are faced with. Imagine the stress.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728231">The BC Coalition of Nursing Associations hosted an emergency forum on the nursing response to the opioid crisis. Like so many, they are devastated by this medical health emergency, and they themselves are suffering from stress, trauma, and exhaustion. All first responders, nurses, health care workers at emergency rooms, and front-line workers with NGOs are overextended, and they deserve our support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728232">While the <Affiliation DbId="214328" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> said that the Liberals would take action and provide support to first responders, we are still waiting. Let us get on with it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728233"> I want to say that we need to do much more. We need to move to a longer-term resolution. Real effort needs to be made to provide addiction treatment. For some, traditional treatment works; for others, not so much. We need to move forward with providing treatment that deals with the addiction, including opioid prescriptions and opioid substitutes. The goal of stabilizing people and getting them away from the illegal market saves lives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728234">We also need to look at the issues around the social determinants of health. We need safe, secure, affordable housing. We need to address poverty. We need to look at the issue of breaking that cycle. We need to address aboriginal child apprehension. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728235">We need a comprehensive approach so that we can move forward once and for all and save lives.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4728239">Mr. Speaker, to answer the last question first, a declaration from the federal government of a public health emergency would allow for federal funding and co-ordination to be made available across the country. As well, the creation of what we call pop-up sites, these temporary safe injection sites, on an emergency basis would be facilitated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728240">Right now in our communities these pop-up sites have occurred, and they have been proven to save lives. This needs to be multiplied across the country. We can model actual best practices on how we can save lives. If the federal government declared a public health emergency, it would actually allow for that to take place.</ParaText>

This and harm reduction are all about that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4728251">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak in support of Bill <Document DbId="8689350" Type="3">C-37</Document>, an act that would better equip both health and law enforcement officials to reduce the harms associated with problematic substance use in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728252">One of the many important amendments proposed in the bill is to streamline the application process for communities seeking to establish supervised consumption sites. Supervised consumption sites are controlled hygienic settings where people can bring previously obtained drugs to use under the supervision of health care professionals and gain access to or information regarding other health and social services, including treatment. In other words, supervised consumption sites are a harm reduction measure and have been proven to be effective for communities where they are needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728253">Our government, since the beginning of its mandate, has been very clear in its support for harm reduction measures. These measures have been proven to reduce the negative health and social impacts associated with problematic substance abuse. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728254">Addiction is a complex issue. I also want to be clear with my fellow members in the House that addiction is a health issue and not a criminal one. Not every individual will respond positively to the same treatment and not every individual is even willing or able to enter treatment on any given day. Evidence demonstrates that individuals who are outside of treatment are at increased risk of major health and social harms, including overdose and death. This is why we must be pragmatic in our response and must let evidence guide us to effective solutions. Now, more than ever, as our country grapples with an ever-increasing opioid crisis, it is essential that evidence-based harm reduction measures be part of the government's comprehensive drug policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728255">On December 12, the <Affiliation DbId="214328" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> announced the new Canadian drugs and substances strategy, which restores harm reduction as a key pillar alongside prevention, treatment, and enforcement. Officially including harm reduction in Canada's new drug strategy was the first step. Putting that commitment into action to save lives is the next step.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728256">The evidence available on the effectiveness of properly establishing and maintaining supervised consumption sites is indisputable. These sites save lives without having a negative impact on the surrounding community. Let me be clear. This commitment will save lives, including in my community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728257">Surrey and, more broadly, British Columbia face a health crisis. I take solace in how neighbourhoods, communities, cities, the province, and now the federal government have stepped up to respond. I often hear stories in my riding of how this drug has devastated lives and families, but for every one story I hear, I hear three more about how folks have stepped up and responded, whether it is local soup kitchens or the newly created Surrey RCMP Outreach Team, which, in the last two weeks, responded to over 55 overdoses. It is heartening to see how Canadians have come together to respond to this crisis, and this new drug strategy is the next step.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728258">I should have mentioned earlier, Mr. Speaker, that I will be sharing my time with the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="214384" Type="2">Victoria</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728259">This legislation is widely viewed by public health experts as a barrier to establishing new supervised consumption sites in communities where they are wanted and needed to help prevent the spread of disease and countless overdose deaths. It is time for these barriers to be removed and I am proud that Bill <Document DbId="8689350" Type="3">C-37</Document> proposes to do just that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728260">Bill <Document DbId="8689350" Type="3">C-37</Document> would support the establishment of supervised consumption sites by assuring communities that their voices would be heard and that each application would be subject to a comprehensive review, while, at the same time, starting from a position that would recognize and acknowledge the compelling evidence that supervised consumption sites work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728261"> In 2011, the Supreme Court of Canada considered this same evidence and concluded that where a "site will decrease the risk of death and disease, and there is little or no evidence that it will have a negative impact on public safety, the Minister should generally grant an exemption." </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4728262">To guide the making of future decisions, the Supreme Court set out five factors that must be considered. These include: evidence, if any, on the impact of such a facility on crime rates; the local conditions indicating a need for such a site; the regulatory structure in place the support the facility; the resources available to support its maintenance; and expression of community support or opposition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728263">Bill <Document DbId="8689350" Type="3">C-37</Document> respects the decision rendered by the highest court in Canada by proposing to replace the 26-point criteria currently in legislation with these five factors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728264">Reducing the number of criteria applicants would have to address would relieve the administrative burden on communities seeking to establish a supervised consumption site, but it would do so without compromising the health and safety of those operating the site, its clients, or the surrounding community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728265">To help applicants through the supervised consumption site application process, our government would post an application form and simplified guidance document online. The application would indicate the type of information that would support the five Supreme Court criteria and would reduce unnecessary burden on applicants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728266">With respect to other stakeholders, such as the municipal government and local police, their views would continue to be considered through the requirement for broad community consultation, thus removing the need to obtain formal letters from these stakeholders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728267">The proposed amendments will also simply the information required to support an application. For example, applicants will no longer be required to submit evidence that supervised consumption sites are effective and have public health benefits. The evidence in this regard is clear. Instead, applicants will need to demonstrate the need for the site and the public health benefits of the proposed site for their local community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728268">Further, with respect to renewals, existing supervised consumption sites would no longer require an application. Instead, a renewal would simply be requested by informing Health Canada of any changes to the information that was submitted as part of a site's last application. This proposal will ensure that the existing sites can focus on serving the needs of their community rather than filling out onerous application forms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728269">Beyond the criteria, the Respect for Communities Act also includes specific principles that the minister must consider when evaluating an application.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728270">Bill <Document DbId="8689350" Type="3">C-37</Document> proposes to remove these principles so that decisions on applications can be based on evidence. It will also increase transparency around the decision made on applications for supervised consumption sites.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728271">If passed, the bill will require decisions on applications to be made public including, if applicable, the reasons for refusing an application.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728272">Our government is committed to making objective, transparent, and evidence-based decisions on any future application to establish supervised consumption sites, and we are committed to making those decisions within a reasonable time frame.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728273">I can assure the House that the review process would continue to be comprehensive, but it would no longer present unnecessary barriers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728274"> These proposed changes will introduce flexibility into the application process so it can be adapted and updated over time to reflect new science and allow communities to respond more quickly to emerging health issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728275">I hope all members of the House will support this important legislation so we can better support communities in their effort to address this serious public health issue.</ParaText>

The member tried a second time to divide the bill. If he really wants to contribute to resolving this problem, he needs to recognize and recommend to his caucus that we pass the bill in its entirety.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4728297">Mr. Speaker, let me begin by saying a few words about how this affects the people of Victoria who sent me here to speak on their behalf. Where I come from this is not an academic debate; it is a crisis across our community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728298">In the first 11 months of last year, my community lost 60 people to overdoses. I personally know families who have lost loved ones. None of us remain unaffected. We have been robbed of far too many people who might still be our friends, our neighbours, and coworkers today if we had the services to prevent overdoses and provide the treatment that is so desperately needed in our community. Still, people in Victoria and across British Columbia have taken what action they can in the absence of leadership from their federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728299">Last April, British Columbia declared the first public health emergency in our history. In December, the provincial health minister authorized temporary overdose prevention sites. There are now three such sites in my city of Victoria. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728300">On January 4, thanks to the hard work of so many in our community, the Vancouver Island Health Authority submitted an application for the first full service safe consumption site in Victoria, and there will be more. That application is now before the <Affiliation DbId="214328" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation>, and I hope that she will do everything in her power as I will do everything in mine to see that this life-saving community initiative is approved without further delay.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728301">The hard work of those who are fighting to save lives on the streets of Victoria has not been in vain. Because of their efforts, we have three small overdose prevention sites in place. In its first month, one such site reported an overdose nearly every day. But because the right services were available, not a single life was lost. That is the difference these services make in the real world. That is why we called for this legislation a year ago. That is why we will not allow it to be delayed any further.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728302">To understand the scale and urgency of this crisis, we need to look beyond our own communities. My home province, British Columbia, lost 914 citizens to illicit drug overdoses just last year. That is not only the deadliest year on record for us, it is on par with the highest overdose rates among the American states. Last year, Ontario lost two citizens a day. That many lives are now lost each and every day in the city of Vancouver alone. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728303">Some 2,000 Canadians died of this in 2015. We know that many more died in 2016 as powerful opioids like fentanyl spread across the country. I know it can be hard to give meaning to numbers like that unless we know some of the victims by name. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728304">Consider what my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="213868" Type="2">Vancouver Kingsway</Affiliation>, our NDP health critic, reminded us of yesterday. In 2003, we lost 44 Canadians during the SARS crisis. During the opioid crisis, we are now losing that many fellow citizens every week. If 40 or 50 Canadians were dying of an infectious disease every week, this House surely would not stand idly by. So let me address something head-on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728305">There are some in this place who think there is nothing we can do to stop the crisis, who think that addiction represents a moral failure, that it has always existed on the margins of society, and all that has changed is that the drugs just get stronger. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728306">For too long, that outdated view guided government policy, and refused to bend to evidence from doctors, courts, and front-line workers. So let us be clear. What we are facing today is unlike anything Canada has ever experienced before. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728307">This is not just about Downtown Eastside Vancouver. It is about suburban kids experimenting with recreational drugs that turn out to be laced with opiates 100 times stronger than heroin, and then they die. It is about athletes and office workers becoming dependent on prescription painkillers, folks who have never struggled before with addiction, but now have nowhere to turn but the street.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4728308">It is about firefighters and paramedics who have to wear masks to stop inhaling drugs so powerful that a dose no bigger than a grain of salt can be deadly. Opioid use disorder is a disease and it should be treated as such. One of those firefighters is Chris Coleman. He came from Vancouver to testify before the House health committee.

              <ParaText id="4728311">It has taken the government far too long to act, but now we have a bill before us that can begin to help. By passing this bill we can lift the barriers, some of them at least, that prevent communities from establishing life-saving safe consumption sites. We can send a signal to provinces, like British Columbia, that the federal government will step up and do its part. We can show people like Chris Coleman, and the thousands of firefighters and paramedics, police officers, and front-line workers like him, that they are not abandoned, that their work does matter, that we do care, and that their community has their back. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728312">We have to be realistic. This bill alone will not solve the opioid crisis. We are here because government after government has failed to invest in detox, treatment, education, and prevention. The government has failed to put in place that foundation of services that would save lives and connect drug users to the support they need to stabilize and begin the long journey out of addiction. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728313">Hundreds of Canadians are now dying in the gaps that governments have let grow year after year. For more than a year, we have been calling for a bill to repeal the Conservatives' Bill <Document DbId="6254806" Type="3">C-2</Document> and lift the barriers that the previous government erected to make it harder for communities to open life-saving safe consumption sites. When I spoke to that bill, I called it the “24 ways to say 'no' act”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728314">It has taken far too long to get here. I regret that the government took so long to come around to our point of view and accept that legislative action repealing Bill <Document DbId="6254806" Type="3">C-2</Document>, or replacing it, was necessary. Thankfully, here we are. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728315">Bill <Document DbId="8689350" Type="3">C-37</Document> would save lives. We must pass it as soon as possible. For that reason, the NDP moved in December to fast-track the bill right to the Senate. It was blocked. I want to make sure that does not happen again and that we get this done. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728316">I will continue to urge the minister to declare a public health emergency and allow emergency overdose prevention sites to operate legally across the country. I will continue to call on the government to use the powers it already has and expedite applications from cities like Montreal, Victoria, and Toronto, that have been gathering dust as Health Canada sits around and looks at them for months at a time. I will continue to ask why the government continues to ignore the recommendations from major cities, medical authorities, and even Parliament's own health committee, on other steps to turn the tide on this crisis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728317">In conclusion, passing this bill is not sufficient, but it is necessary. Therefore, on behalf of a Canadian community at ground zero in this crisis, I urge all members to support this life-saving bill and pass it now before more Canadians are lost to this preventable crisis. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4728336">Madam Speaker, when I last rose in the House to address the issue of abandoned vessels, we were clear about what the problem was.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728337">For maybe 15 years now coastal communities have been describing a myriad of bureaucracy that has made it impossible for them to identify which federal department, oceans being under federal jurisdiction, would deal with an abandoned vessel creating a navigation problem, or an oil spill, or visual harm to their community. People would phone Nav Canada and be told to phone Coast Guard. Coast Guard would tell them to phone Environment. Environment would tell them to phone the province if the vessel was washed up on the land.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728338"> It was a mess. It was embarrassing. I know a local community organization which for 10 years tried to find a federal or a provincial partner that would work with it to remove these abandoned vessels. Whether they are old commercial fishing vessels, whether they are worn-out fibreglass vessels, and whether it is because we are having more and more storms or more and more bankruptcies, more of these vessels are showing up on our shorelines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728339">Coastal communities have been very patient and very persistent on this matter. I want to give a special shout-out to leaders in my own riding of <Affiliation DbId="214119" Type="2">Nanaimo—Ladysmith</Affiliation>, particularly Stz'uminus Chief John Elliott, Ladysmith Mayor Aaron Stone, and former mayor Rob Hutchins, who are very strong leaders. Together we got a significant vessel removed with the help of the former minister of fisheries and oceans, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214600" Type="2">Nunavut</Affiliation>. We are very grateful for that, and it was a big win for our community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728340">However, we are looking for permanent solutions so that communities do not have to work as hard as Ladysmith did to have this four-year-old problem resolved. This problem was from a vessel towed into the harbour by Transport Canada. This did not originate in Ladysmith.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728341">I will mention the solutions that I have been proposing, both in my role as local government and now as member of Parliament. One is to make Coast Guard one-stop shopping so people do not get the runaround. Coast Guard can negotiate with its various other member departments regarding who will take ultimate responsibility, but it is one-stop shopping. There should be more resources for Coast Guard obviously, because it is already doing this work off the side of its desks. Other things would be fibreglass recycling, innovation and research, and investment, because we need to find a market for this product. There should be an amnesty on abandoned boats, a kind of “bring in your boat” program, so that we can partner with local governments and try to get ahead of the problem. Vessel registration needs to be fixed. We should look at taking the load off taxpayers, who right now are paying 90% of the cost. We need to find solutions to take that cost off the backs of the taxpayers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728342">The national oceans protection plan was announced by the government back in the fall, and I was glad to see that leadership as the Conservatives certainly did not do it. However, we still do not know what that would include. One of the pieces that is a bit of a worry is the indication that, like the Conservatives, the Liberals think a solution to abandoned vessels is to criminalize the problem. We cannot penalize people we cannot find, and in any case, there are already remedies to take a person who has abandoned their vessel to court. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728343">I am looking for the government's assurance that the national oceans protection plan was not just PR to soften the blow of a Kinder Morgan oil tanker approval that we sure did not want on our coast. That was all downside for us. There was no upside. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728344">Please let me know when this legislation will be tabled, when we will finally have solutions for coastal communities to solve the impossible problem of abandoned vessels.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4728345">Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214119" Type="2">Nanaimo—Ladysmith</Affiliation> for her question, and for her advocacy for her community. I wish to assure the House that this government takes the issue of abandoned, derelict, and wrecked vessels very seriously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728346">While most vessel owners do properly dispose of their property, the few that do not, we agree, pose risks to safe navigation, the marine environment, public health, safety, and local economies. That is one of the reasons we supported the member's Motion Nr. 40 back in October, which called for meaningful steps in this area. We agree.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728347">This is also the reasoning behind the announcement on November 7 about the $1.5 billion for the oceans protection plan. It is what she is asking for. It is a comprehensive strategy to address abandoned, derelict, and wrecked vessels, that focuses both on prevention and removal, and includes a robust polluter-pay approach for future vessel clean-up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728348">One only has to look at the dedicated efforts to manage the threats posed by the <I>Kathryn Spirit</I> in Beauharnois, Quebec or the <I>Viki Lyne II</I> in Ladysmith Harbour to see how imperative it is that we hold vessel owners to account. These kinds of situations cannot continue, and we are working hard to prevent them, and manage these complex situations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728349">During consultations last summer, partners and stakeholders across the country repeatedly told federal officials that the current suite of legislation, policies, and programs are not effective in addressing the problem. They also called for clear federal leadership. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728350">This government has listened to Canadians, and will put into place new legislation that puts the responsibility and liability on vessel owners to properly remove and dispose of their vessels. This will include a new prohibition on the act of abandoning a vessel. We will create measures to improve owner identification, so that vessel owners can be held accountable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728351">Addressing this issue requires concerted effort from various levels of government. Our government will work with provincial, territorial, and local governments, and indigenous groups to support the clean-up of smaller, high priority vessels posing risks to coastal communities, and develop plans to address large commercial problem vessels according to the risk they pose. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728352">Provinces, territories, and local governments must be involved, given their shared responsibility for managing the environment, and their lead roles in waste and land management, as well as in protecting the rights of private property owners. They have the sight lines locally. They know what is happening locally to support monitoring and enforcement activities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728353">The strategy also calls for targeted education, outreach, and research activities to help inform vessel owners of their responsibilities for proper vessel disposal, and to develop enhanced disposal options. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728354">In addition, we will signal our intent to accede to the 2007 Nairobi International Convention on the Removal of Wrecks, which will provide added protection going forward for Canadian taxpayers by increasing vessel owner responsibility and liability for cleaning-up hazardous wrecks in Canadian waters. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728355">Our approach is modelled on the success of other jurisdictions that are actually ahead of Canada on this issue. Our government is intent on getting the solutions right. We believe the comprehensive approach laid out in the oceans protection plan will get us there. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4728358">Coastal people have been very patient, but I am hearing that with another boating and tourist season advancing, with jobs and the shellfish industry at risk, even the smallest spill from an abandoned vessel would put jobs, the ecology, and community at stake. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4728367">Madam Speaker, this evening in the House of Commons, I would like to raise the issue of the Yazidi genocide. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728368">The Yazidi people are a highly persecuted ethnic and religious minority primarily based in Iraq. They are some of the most persecuted people in the world. In the last two years, they have suffered extreme atrocities at the hands of extremists within the religious majority in the area. That is ISIS. The Yazidi people have suffered rape and mutilation. Their people are in mass graves in the area, and their women have been taken as sexual slaves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728369">In October, after many, many months and much pushing, the House unanimously adopted a motion to prioritize Yazidi victims of genocide to come to Canada as refugees. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728370">For people who are listening, Canada has two main ways for refugees to come into the country. First, privately sponsored refugees are those who come through the generosity of Canadians who have raised funds to sponsor refugees. The second is through government-assisted refugees. That is where the United Nations refers cases to Canada and then the government pays for the sponsorship of the refugees. The sad reality is that exactly zero out of tens of thousands of refugees who have been referred to Canada by the United Nations have come from this group of people. That is shameful. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728371">I've had United Nations officials in my office. I have asked them why there are no cases being referred to Canada. They actually told me that because of the time constraint the government placed on them last year for the refugee initiative, it was easier just to pick out of the religious majority in these camps. That is shameful, because these people cannot actually get to refugee camps in most cases. They are internally displaced and they cannot get to refugee camps, because they are persecuted the whole way there. Then when they get to the refugee camps, in order to make these United Nations lists, oftentimes there are great delays. We have heard allegations of discrimination against these people by UN processing agents. The reality is that they are not making the lists. They are not being referred to Canada. That is an issue the government needs to look at.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728372">The reality is there are non-governmental organizations on the ground that have been working very hard and which are highly reputable. The government could use them in order to bring those refugees to Canada. That is completely within the government's jurisdiction. It should be doing that, but what have the Liberals done to date? They have not talked to any of those non-governmental organizations and they are not working to bring those people here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728373">We are now in February, almost four months after the motion passed. None of the non-governmental organizations have heard any word about how many Yazidi refugees are going to be processed or how they are going to come here. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728374">This weekend the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> sent out a fairly asinine tweet saying that we are open and welcoming refugees. Where are the Yazidis? Why, when I stand in this House of Commons, can the government not tell me how many Yazidis will come to Canada in the next couple of weeks? My gut says it is because it is lip service. The Liberals do not have a plan. They are not going to meet the terms of this deadline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728375">My question tonight is very simple. How many Yazidis will the government bring to Canada before the motion's deadline?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4728379"> The member for <Affiliation DbId="213994" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> knows the respect I hold for her and her passion on this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728380">Canadians have joined with people all across the world to deplore the murderous actions of Daesh. Canada has been a key contributor in the international efforts to address the crisis and resettle those who have been displaced from their homes. Since November 4, 2015, we have welcomed almost 40,000 Syrian refugees. Also, the Government of Canada has fulfilled its 2009 commitment to resettle 23,000 Iraqi refugees by 2015.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728381"> I am pleased that all parties are co-operating to help the vulnerable Yazidi population, as evidenced by the unanimous support to bring Yazidis to Canada within 120 days. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728382">We are committed to meeting this 120-day time limit, but it is equally important to take the necessary time to do this right and to ensure that we have in place such things as settlement supports, welcoming communities, interpreters, and plans to meet the psychological and social needs of those we are welcoming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728383">That is why, as the former minister said in his response to this question, we have been working very actively on a two-part strategy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728384">We will bring individuals who are residing outside of Iraq, in Turkey and Lebanon, and while this work is being done, we will concurrently explore options for those residing in Iraq.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728385">While we recognize the need for protection for victims of Daesh, Canadians realize the region's continued instability presents challenges in identifying and interviewing them, not to mention getting them out of Iraq, while ensuring the safety of our immigration officers and members of vulnerable groups.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728386">The internationally agreed upon approach to resettlement is to focus on refugees, in other words, those persons who have been forced to flee their country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728387">Canada's resettlement program is designed to provide protection for refugees who are outside their country of origin. Individuals who have had to flee their home but remain within their home country are known as internally displaced people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728388">The safety of individuals, staff, and partners is a top priority when developing operational plans. It takes considerable resources to process difficult-to-access populations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728389">That said, the Government of Canada is looking at ways to respond to the challenges in northern Iraq. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada officials recently completed a third visit to the region. They interviewed a large number of Syrian refugees, as well as some internally displaced persons, and met with key partners to gather as much information as possible on the situation on the ground.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728390">Canada has a long, proud, and well-respected tradition of helping to protect persons in need. While we want to continue to be a world leader in this area, there is no quick fix.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4728398">Madam Speaker, I am standing to follow up on a question I asked in October, but I think I need to set the stage first in terms of what the actual issue is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728399">Residents of the city of Kamloops or the city of Kelowna can go online and see what the mayor makes and see the audited reports of the city. Residents of British Columbia or Alberta can do the same thing. That can be done, indeed, across Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728400">Our constituents can go online and see the audited financial statements of the Government of Canada, and they can look at their individual MPs and see how much they make and how much they spend on items such as travel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728401">Shareholders can actually go online and see a company's information. Companies are responsible for reporting audited statements and have pretty good, robust information available to shareholders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728402">There was a glaring omission in the transparency rules, and that was that first nations communities did not have the same obligations. When we were the government, we thought that the community members, the band members, deserved the same kind of transparency that all other Canadians expect. That is that the band posts, in a public way, audited financial statements, salaries, and expenses. Again, it is basic transparency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728403">I want to note that this is not about any part of the government saying that it wants to target specific groups. When this information is posted, they are held accountable. This was truly to allow community band members to hold their councils to account and to have the ability, because I think it is also important, to compare, perhaps, what their chief is making with what some others are making.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728404">We found that we had a very good compliance rate. The measures came in in 2014, and by 2015, we had a compliance rate of over 92%. That is a very solid rate of bands, chiefs, and councils posting their statements and expenses and reporting to their band members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728405">What was very good about this is that it put aside some of the notions many people had about misuses of the money. Where there were misuses, it became very apparent, because the band members could actually hold their councils to account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728406">What this minister did was say that it did not matter. Some of the chiefs did not like it, so the government was going to get rid of transparency and not enforce the compliance measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728407"> It is absolutely appalling that the minister would take such an anti-democratic position and put first nations grassroots communities at such a disadvantage by not providing the transparency that all other Canadians enjoy and expect.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4728409">I want to assure all members of the House that we take allegations of this kind seriously. What the minister did, and did cautiously, was to open a process of dialogue with indigenous people and first nations to look at what real accountability and transparency should be between first nations governments and the Government of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728410">Our government did not buy-in to the tactics of the former administration, which was a top-down approach of dealing with indigenous people and indigenous governments. We have chosen to take a different path and in doing so, we are also ensuring full accountability and transparency for first nations and all Canadians across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728411">INAC acted quickly, and this is just one example, in 2015 to initiate a forensic audit at the request of the chief and council of the Shuswap Indian band to investigate the possible misappropriation of funds in its community. Further audit work was completed in 2016. Following the disclosure of additional financial transactions, a summary of the findings of both audits was provided to the community in July, 2016. That is openness and transparency and that is the Government of Canada acting with first nations band councils when there are issues and problems that have to be confronted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728412">At that point, the department then turned over the results of the audit to the Kelowna detachment of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The department has been in regular contact with the chief and with the RCMP during its investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728413">I want to be clear that members of the Shuswap nation and all Canadians can count on the Government of Canada's support for their communities. That is our job and we take that responsibility seriously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728414">We also understand and realize that accountability and transparency is important and therefore it is a priority. We also know we can only achieve this by working in full partnership with first nations leadership and organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728415"> Before and after the election, first nations from coast to coast to coast were clear that top-down solutions did not work and they had never worked. We therefore remain committed to establishing a new fiscal relationship with first nations. That is why our government is engaging with their leadership and with communities to determine a way forward that is based on a renewed relationship and one that advances reconciliation and not top-down dictation. This means engaging first nation leadership face to face, but it also means that we are consulting on how to best support mutual transparency and accountability between first nations governments and the Government of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4728416">I would encourage and I ask all members in the House to support that process and to visit our website so they can learn more about those consultations and how they can participate in them.</ParaText>
