        <SubjectOfBusinessContent>
          <ParaText id="4176171">The House resumed from December 8 consideration of the motion for an address to His Excellency the Governor General in reply to his speech at the opening of the session, and of the amendment.</ParaText>
          <Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Johns" id="8764319">
            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="214489" Type="2">Mr. Gord Johns (Courtenay—Alberni, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4176172">Mr. Speaker, before I get started, I want to inform you that I am splitting my time with my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="214139" Type="2">Essex</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176173">As this is my first full speech in the House of Commons, I want to thank the great people of Courtenay—Alberni for electing me as their member of Parliament. It is truly an honour to represent this great riding, which includes a large section of central Vancouver Island.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176174"> Mr. Speaker, I do not know if you have ever been to my home riding, but I would like to take a moment to introduce you and the members of the House to the land and the people who live there. I will then discuss some of the challenges that they face, as well as the opportunities that we have in relation to the Speech from the Throne.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176175">I know that many members here would champion their own riding as the most beautiful place in Canada. I am confident that the physical geography found in Courtenay—Alberni has no equal. It starts at the beginning in Comox Valley, the islands, and Mount Washington, which normally has the largest amount of snowfall in North America. It stretches down through Oceanside and includes Parksville, Qualicum, and Nanoose Bay. They are beautiful beaches that we all know and care deeply about. It stretches across to the east side, Denman Island, Hornby Island, and Lasqueti Island, and crosses over the Alberni Valley and Mount Arrowsmith to the Pacific Rim. It includes the Long Beach national park, the great beaches of Tofino, and ten Nuu-chah-nulth communities, the nation of Qualicum, and part of the traditional territory of the K'ómoks First Nation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176176">My story in my riding dates back over 100 years, when my great-grandfather met my great-grandmother in Cumberland. Through my family and my community, I have a deep understanding of this place. I have witnessed the changes, the hardships, and the victories that we have faced together and the challenges that we face today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176177">The realities of some of the challenges and issues in our riding include climate change, the effects of which are being felt right across my riding. The previous Conservative government refused to acknowledge those realities, but all it would have had to do was talk to the folks at home who were seeing the effects first-hand. Many people who live in rural communities will share the story. The effects of climate change are affecting them now. They include the historic melting of our glaciers and snowcaps. Bob Cole, a lifelong Port Alberni resident, was on CBC Radio in June, talking about how, for the first time in his life, the glacier had melted in June.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176178">Increased flooding and boil water advisories are affecting municipal infrastructure. They are affecting our agriculture and our food security. Major droughts and forest fires are affecting our economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176179">People in British Columbia and coastal British Columbia will always say that the health of our salmon is the health of our communities. It rained just in time in August this year, or we would have lost all of our salmon. That is our culture, our economy, and our lifeline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176180">The ocean acidification in Baynes Sound a couple of years ago killed our shellfish sector. We had Humboldt squid, a foreign species, showing up on our beaches in Tofino a couple of years ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176181">This is real. Climate change is here. I am overjoyed that the Liberal government, as evidenced in the throne speech, is embracing a new tone when it comes to climate change, but my constituents need more than a tone of change from their government. They need real action, setting ambitious, accountable emissions reduction targets with annual progress reports for meeting targets enshrined in Canadian law. My colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="213881" Type="2">Edmonton Strathcona</Affiliation>, presented an opportunity for us to do that just yesterday. It is an opportunity to strengthen Canada's environmental assessment process by including climate impact assessments so that new projects will not derail reduction targets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176182">We need to highlight the work of environmental protection and those who do it every day, including the Coast Guard. Marine traffic control is a very important issue in my riding. We closed the Tofino and Ucluelet station. That was the station that communicated right across the Strait of Juan de Fuca to our American allies. It protected mariners in one of the fastest growing marine areas of the economy of North America.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176183">We are looking at the closure of the Comox station in March. This station is very important to coastal British Columbians in terms of marine traffic safety, because it is it the only marine traffic control centre that is not in a tsunami subduction zone. We know that a tsunami is going to happen. It is not “if”, it is “when”. This is very important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176184">We saw during the <I>Leviathan II</I> boating incident in Tofino that it was local knowledge and local people that saved lives. Aboriginal people have been ill-equipped with training and equipment to save lives on the coast of British Columbia. The Ahousaht people saved lives in Tofino. People in the Haida Gwaii stopped the drifting <I>Simushir</I> from hitting the shore. People in Hartley Bay saved lives when a BC Ferries ferry went aground on the central B.C. coast. We need to better support these nations and coastal communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176185">My community and the communities of coastal British Columbia rely heavily on dealing with derelict vessels and pollution in our waters, as members can imagine, but we have not dealt with that. However, Jean Crowder presented a very good opportunity in the last sitting of the 41st Parliament to deal with derelict vessels. We need national leadership on this to deal with the protection of the environment when vessels go aground and also to make sure that we protect mariner safety. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176186">In my riding and in Canada a whole, more economic activity that works in conjunction with the environment is needed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176187">Small business is the core of our economy and the natural leader of innovation. We did not hear anything about small business in the Speech from the Throne, and we need to make sure that we do something about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176188">Raw log exports in my riding have gone up tenfold in 10 years. That is not double, but tenfold. This is deeply affecting the economy of Port Alberni and Vancouver Island, and future generations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176189">One-third of the children in Alberni Valley are living in poverty. This is unacceptable to everyone in my riding. It is unacceptable to everyone in this House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176190">We have opportunities to invest in innovation. In Sweden they are making car parts out of wood. This morning a forest company announced the opportunity to make biofuel out of wood. This is the kind of innovation that we need and that we can embrace, but we need the government's help to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176191">We have opportunities to invest in emerging sectors such as tech. The tech sector is the fastest growing sector in British Columbia. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176192">What better place to have higher learning, with a natural surrounding like Courtenay—Alberni and the west coast?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176193">We need to improve the role of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans so that it is doing its job and gets back to its mandate to protect our wild salmon. We need boots on the ground so that we can help with the return of our salmon in coastal British Columbia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176194">We need support for infrastructure, especially for BC Ferries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176195"> I am hoping that the House will support these important calls to action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176196">On social challenges, as I began to express, one-third of the children in Port Alberni and in Alberni Valley are living in poverty. Seniors in Oceanside and throughout our riding cannot get access to doctors. This is unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176197">Getting back to Alberni Valley, the life expectancy there is four years lower than the Canadian average. It is 40th in the world, just above the Dominican Republic. We have some work to do. Affordable child care would really help make a difference in the lives of people of Courtenay—Alberni. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176198">We need a seniors strategy. Having the highest median age for seniors in my riding in the nation, I see firsthand the results of not having a seniors strategy, and not having a strategy for dementia and Alzheimer's. It is important that we do that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176199">We need better support for mental health and for veterans. We heard this every day at the door, as well as the impact of a failed economy on our youth, and youth unemployment. We need to ensure that our young people have an economy that will take them into the future, and make sure they have a living wage and an affordable place to live.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176200">There are opportunities for us to move forward, and I would like to talk about some of those opportunities, working in collaboration with first nations. Often the wealth of our country starts in rural communities, but it leaves rural communities. We need to have shared prosperity with aboriginal people, and with all of our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176201"> In recent years, the Nuu-chah-nulth won a very important court case in the Supreme Court of Canada: the right to catch and sell fish. This decision was awarded to them, but still the government has refused to sit at the table with the Nuu-chah-nulth people and negotiate fairly. I call upon this new government to do just that: sit and have fair and reasonable negotiations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176202">I am excited to bring a message of hope, optimism, and love from Courtenay—Alberni. I hope that the House will embrace our challenges, that we will stand together and work on our challenges together with ridings across this country to make sure we build a healthier, better, more prosperous Canada.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4176203">Mr. Speaker, I would like to hear the member's thoughts about the indigenous fishery and how giving greater opportunity to share the natural resources of our collective lands would benefit the indigenous communities, including lifting children out of poverty from those communities, and giving pride to the parents to be those providers that we need them to be.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4176204">Mr. Speaker, in response to my friend from Winnipeg Centre, I want to outline that the court case is important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176205"> During the campaign the chief from Hesquiaht first nation, April Charleson, talked about the fact that the government has cut the welfare rate and income assistance rates. Transportation had been gutted so they could not even get home. It was $250 to get a water taxi from Hesquiaht to Tofino to buy groceries. At the same time they had won their court victory to catch and sell the very fish that were running by their villages and they could not even get access to those resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176206">My colleague is absolutely right. This is the solution. This is an opportunity to feed the people of Hesquiaht, feed the people of our communities. This is an opportunity to make sure that we empower people instead of mismanaging poverty. We have a historic opportunity right now to do just that and I hope my colleague will join me in helping make that happen.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4176207">Mr. Speaker, my riding of Nanaimo-—Ladysmith has also shared the trauma of raw log exports, I would say. We heard it every night on the campaign doorstep. People are concerned about seeing ships loading raw logs off the waterline of our communities while jobs are leaving our communities at the same time. I understand 20,000 value-added, high-tech jobs around paper and wood manufacturing have been lost in our province since the Conservatives took power 10 years ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176208">I hope the member can elaborate on the impact of that loss of jobs on his community.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4176209">Mr. Speaker, I have a personal connection to the forestry sector. My great-grandfather was a papermaker at a mill in Ocean Falls on the central coast of British Columbia. That town was a bustling community of 4,000 people. It produced Olympic swimmers back in the day. Today, that community has 75 people in it. I do not want to see that happen to Port Alberni. I do not want to see that happen to any more coastal communities, especially communities in my riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176210">We have an opportunity to invest in innovation and technology. In our campaign we talked about the NDP having invested $40 million in the forestry sector to do just that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176211">I hope the government will be able to see the opportunity that we have with our forest sector and the opportunity to keep jobs in British Columbia, in Canada, instead of shipping raw logs out of our country and shipping jobs out of our country. This has an enormous impact on our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176212">The socio-economic indicators in Alberni Valley may show an unemployment rate of 10% but it does not truly reflect the true unemployment rate. The social assistance rate is 253% above the provincial average of British Columbia, and that is not okay. We need to do better. We have an opportunity. We have a thriving, beautiful opportunity to invest in our forestry sector. We are counting on the federal government and the provincial government of British Columbia to work together in collaboration with business to change direction in the forestry sector and make us more competitive so that we can make our mark on the world. This is our opportunity to do just that. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4176214">I too spent some time in the Comox-Campbell River area in the aquaculture business. I realize the beauty of that area but yet the challenges that the region faces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176215"> I come from Saint John, New Brunswick. As I stated earlier this week in the House, my city leads the country unfortunately in child poverty. The rate in Saint John is 31%. One thing I am proud of on behalf of the Liberal government is that the Canada child benefit will pull 315,000 children out of poverty across our country. Would my opponent agree that the Canada child benefit will be a great thing for his riding?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4176216">Mr. Speaker, of course we welcome giving money to people in need, especially parents and children who need help. I will give the House an example. I knocked on a woman's door in Parksville. Her name was Karlin. Karlin pulled out her child care bill and it was $750. She pulled out her paycheque and it was $750. She earns $10.72 an hour. It is not enough. Fifteen dollar-a-day child care, a living wage. A living wage in Courtenay—Alberni is $17.22 an hour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176217">We need more action from the government. We would certainly welcome the member working with us on finding solutions to help deal with these problems to make sure that we make Karlin's life a lot better and a lot easier.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4176251">Mr. Speaker, as this is my first speech in the House, I would like to take a moment to thank the people of Essex for putting their trust in me and giving me the opportunity to serve them in the next four years. Essex is a beautiful and diverse riding, made up of many small towns, including LaSalle, Amherstburg, Kingsville, Lakeshore, Essex, Harrow, and many other small communities. As their voice in Parliament, I will listen to their concerns and take their priorities to Ottawa, and fight for them every step of the way. As their MP, I will embrace a positive, progressive perspective. I will consult with everyday people, and I will strive to ensure that all levels of government work together for the best interests of Essex.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176252">Coming out of such a long election campaign, I would like to thank all of the amazing volunteers who helped me get elected. Their dedication is truly inspiring and made all the difference. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176253">I would like to thank my family members for their unwavering support, my husband Germaine, our sons Maxwell and Maliq, my parents Tom and Linda, my brother and sister, extended family and friends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176254">Today I am honoured to rise in the House to debate the government's Speech from the Throne. During the election campaign, the Liberals made many promises to Canadians, and there are high expectations on them to deliver as government. While the throne speech was thin on details, I am hopeful that this is not an indication of a lack of commitment to follow through on their promises.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176255">As the representative for Essex, and as a member of the NDP caucus, the progressive opposition, I will work to hold the government to account and push the Liberals to keep their word on increasing investments in infrastructure, boosting public pensions, and implementing democratic reforms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176256">One of the government's top priorities is what it calls a tax cut for the middle class. However, in reality nearly 70% of Canadians, including middle-income earners, will not receive any benefit. The NDP propose to modify the tax cut so that 90% of Canadians will benefit, helping to reduce income inequality and making our tax system a little fairer. Unfortunately, the Liberals have not accepted our proposal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176257">I hope to see the government make job creation a real priority. Too often, workers are forced to turn to part-time precarious work, as good full-time jobs disappear at an alarming rate. My riding of Essex has one of the highest unemployment rates in Canada, and the working class there really suffered under the Conservative government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176258">Communities depend on jobs and sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture, IT, and logistics. There are many small businesses in my region that contribute so much to our communities. I have met with many people in the riding who have terrific ideas on how we can move our region forward and support quality local job creation. I am excited about what we can accomplish together. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176259">I was pleased to see the throne speech reiterate a commitment to investing in infrastructure. Although few details were provided, I am hopeful that we will soon see a plan for getting this money out the door. My riding of Essex will benefit in many ways from great investments in infrastructure. More rail and better roads will help people and goods move with more ease. It will generate good jobs and more economic activity, which is what our region desperately needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176260">As many will know, plans are under way to construct a second bridge and border crossing for the Windsor-Detroit corridor. Building this bridge will lead to increased trade, which is vital to our long-term economic prosperity. I applaud my colleague, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214230" Type="2">Windsor West</Affiliation>, who has advocated for this new crossing for years and worked hard to advance the file. I look forward to working with him and the current government on this and many other issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176261">In the throne speech, the government committed to providing a more secure retirement for Canadians by working with the provinces and territories to enhance the Canada pension plan. After years of Conservative stalling, I welcome this important commitment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176262">On the doorsteps in Essex, I heard from many people who were concerned about their ability to save for their future and to retire with dignity. People work hard all their lives, and they deserve greater retirement security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176263">As a New Democrat MP, I will stand up for strengthening CPP, returning eligibility for old age security to age 65, protecting workplace pensions, and lifting seniors out of poverty by boosting the guaranteed income supplement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176264">I must also point out some of the topics that the Speech from the Throne failed to address.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176265">As the NDP critic for international trade, I would like to see the government provide much greater details on its plan to consult Canadians on the trans-Pacific partnership. The Conservatives negotiated this deal behind closed doors in the dying days of their government. We all know that this deal could result in the loss of tens of thousands of Canadian jobs. Nowhere would the effect of this be more deeply felt than in my riding of Essex, where so many people are employed by the auto and agricultural sectors.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="30">(1030)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4176266">As an auto worker, I saw first-hand how job losses have impacted families and entire communities. When I started working on the assembly line at Ford, we had 6,700 people. Twenty years later, we are down to 1,500. These losses have been devastating. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176267">In 2008, I found myself laid off. I know what that feels like. I know how it impacts our families and the decisions we make about our lives and our future. Many of my friends and co-workers made difficult choices, such as moving away from their families for work, and returning to school, as I did. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176268">Facing economic uncertainty and starting over is unfortunately something that many Canadians experience today. I understand their frustrations and challenges on a deeply personal level, and I commit to working-class people in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="214139" Type="2">Essex</Affiliation> and in Canada that I will be our voice in Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176269">With so much on the line, Canadians deserve to be listened to. On the campaign trail, the Liberals promised public consultations, but their Speech from the Throne was silent on this and on compensation for farmers and auto workers who will be hurt by this deal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176270">I look forward to working with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="213971" Type="2">University—Rosedale</Affiliation> on the TPP and many other trade-related issues. Although we will not always agree, I am optimistic that we can have a positive collaborative relationship. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176271">I also look forward to working with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214005" Type="2">LaSalle—Émard—Verdun</Affiliation> in his capacity as <Affiliation DbId="214676" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of International Trade</Affiliation>, as well as the honourable member for <Affiliation DbId="170668" Type="2">Battlefords—Lloydminster</Affiliation>, the Conservative critic for international trade. On the TPP, I'm confident that we can get a better deal for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176272">Turning my attention to another issue now, the Speech from the Throne talked about working with the provinces and territories to develop a new health accord. However, I did not see a commitment to cancelling the Conservatives' planned cuts to health care. Reversing these cuts will allow us to invest in improving seniors care, making prescription drug coverage more affordable, and helping more Canadians to find a family doctor.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176273"> The speech also failed to outline plans to fight poverty and reduce inequality in Canada. I spoke earlier, applauding the government's commitment to enhancing the CPP. However, we in the NDP believe so much more must be done for low-income seniors, including boosting the GIS and reversing the Conservatives' cuts to OAS. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176274">The rate of child poverty in Canada is shockingly high and deserves more attention from the federal government. I am proud to belong to a party that has worked to advance that issue for decades. In 1989, the House of Commons unanimously adopted former NDP leader Ed Broadbent's motion to end child poverty in Canada, but for 25 years, Conservative and Liberal governments have failed to act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176275">Today, more children live in poverty than in 1989. The NDP has proposed a new way forward: close the tax loophole currently enjoyed by CEOs on stock options. Those funds would be redirected to low-income families through an enhanced working income tax benefit and an enhanced national child benefit supplement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176276">As I near the end of my allotted time, I'd like to thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the opportunity to rise in the House today. As the Member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="214139" Type="2">Essex</Affiliation>, I'm committed to fighting for the people of my riding. I will stand up for good jobs, better health care, help for those who work hard to get ahead, and a better deal on the trans-Pacific partnership.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4176278">I also want to indicate that it is obvious many of the challenges in her area will be fulfilled through our Liberal promises over the next four-year mandate, as many of the issues she addressed we have in the throne speech or have shared throughout the campaign.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176279">My question to the hon. member would be about the trans-Pacific partnership. The NDP was totally against it and wanted it out, and she seemed to indicate in her speech that we should move forward, but maybe with some changes or consultations. I am glad to see that, but I would like to know if the NDP position now is that we work closely in establishing that trade deal.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4176281">We will certainly be participating in all of the discussions around the TPP because this trade deal has massive implications for working people.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4176284">Mr. Speaker, I listened intently to the member's comments. I agree with some, in terms of concerns, and I certainly have questions in terms of some of the solutions that have been outlined in the member's speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176285">I want to say, in response to one of the previous questions, that it appears the Liberal Party believes that promises deliver results. They do not. Action delivers results. The government has shown through the throne speech that it is long on promises and short on action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176286">What is being proposed for the middle-income tax cut, which the member has spoken to, is incredibly short-sighted, leaving so many in society out of the benefits that the government has proposed and indeed has put before the House. I grew up in government housing in a place where I was surrounded by those who were earning the least in society. These people were not looking for a handout, but a way out.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4176288">Mr. Speaker, I believe that the NDP has been quite clear on its desire for an auto strategy in Canada, a manufacturing strategy in Canada. Manufacturing jobs in our communities provide many spinoff jobs. There is an incredible benefit to the communities where they exist. We need a manufacturing strategy because it is an important component in our GDP. Therefore, we require the government across the aisle, as well as members on this side of the House, to seriously look at implementing a manufacturing strategy in Canada, so we can save good-paying jobs for all Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4176294"> It is a great honour and privilege to be standing here for the first time to deliver this speech in such a great House, the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176295">I want to take this moment to thank all of my supporters and volunteers, and I send a very special thanks to my wife, Lisa; my two children, Riley and Kate; my mom and dad, Mike and Linda; and all my other relatives, in-laws, and friends. I thank them all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176296">On December 4, I was delighted to hear the Speech from the Throne delivered by His Excellency the Governor General, David Johnston. The Governor General is an extremely intelligent and remarkable individual. It was extra special hearing the speech delivered by him because he is from northern Ontario. He was born in Sudbury but was raised and educated in Sault Ste. Marie.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176297">Now that the Speech from the Throne has been delivered, we begin to make real change happen here for the people of Sault Ste. Marie and this great country. The riding of Sault Ste. Marie is located in the heart of the Great Lakes on the Trans-Canada Highway on the border of Michigan. It is the home to a diverse group of people, including the first nations of Garden River and Batchewana, and the communities of Goulais River, Heyden, Searchmont, Aweres, Prince Township, and Sault Ste. Marie.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176298">It is known as a very warm and welcoming place. It is the home to Sault College, Algoma University, the Canadian Forest Institute, Searchmont Ski Resort, a number of beautiful provincial parks, and the Soo Greyhounds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176299">I have had an opportunity, since the October 19 election, to meet with a number of business, political, and community leaders in Sault Ste. Marie, and there is a renewed sense of optimism and hope in my riding; and I believe that is so in Canada as well. In fact yesterday, I had the opportunity to host a meeting here in Ottawa with the chief from Garden River First Nation, Paul Syrette. He was accompanied by councillors Chris Solomon, Caroline Barry, and Andy Rickard. We discussed a number of important issues for Garden River, including the need for infrastructure, economic development, and the inquiry into the murdered and missing indigenous women and girls. It was an excellent conversation, and I look forward to working with them over the next four years in a nation-to-nation discussion, along with Batchewana and a number of other first nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176300">Sault Ste. Marie, though, is not just diverse because of its people. In fact, it is home to a group of diverse industries. It is the self-proclaimed alternative energy capital of North America. It partakes in a wide range of energy projects including wind energy, with the Prince Wind Farm; hydroelectricity, with five hydroelectric stations generating a total of 203 megawatts of renewable energy; solar energy; co-generation; and reverse polymerization.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176301"> During the campaign, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> visited my riding to reaffirm this government's commitment to invest $200 million more annually to create sector-specific strategies that support innovation and clean technologies in the forestry, fisheries, mining, energy, and agricultural sectors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176302">That is why I was delighted to hear in the Speech from the Throne that this government continues to hold to that promise. Protecting the environment and growing the economy are not incompatible goals, and it is time that a government starts treating them as such.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176303"> The diversification of the economy is more important now than ever in Sault Ste. Marie and Canada. Sault Ste. Marie relies heavily on the steel industry. Essar Steel Algoma and Tenaris Algoma Tubes are two of the largest employers in my riding. To put things in perspective, Essar Steel Algoma is one of only three fully integrated steel mills that remain in Canada, and on an annual basis it contributes $1.2 billion to Canada's GDP. It provides 2,800 direct jobs and more than 5,000 indirect jobs.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="45">(1045)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4176304"> Sault Ste. Marie was built on the steel industry, and as a representative for my community here in Ottawa, I have the job of ensuring the government does what it can to protect and ensure its continued growth. This is not going to be a simple task. Like many other industries, the steel industry is facing challenging economic times after a decade of neglect. In fact, shortly after my election to this House, Essar Steel Algoma gained CCAA creditor protection and is currently restructuring. Tenaris, a leading supplier of tubes and related services for the energy industry, has laid off hundreds of its employees from my riding. As in other areas of Canada, the steel industry in Sault Ste. Marie faces a number of challenges. It is relying on governments, including this one, to think critically and to engage with producers and other stakeholders to find suitable solutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176305"> For those reasons, I am glad that this government is committed, as it was in the campaign, to historic spending on infrastructure, which will help stimulate the economy both locally in Sault Ste. Marie and nationally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176306">As a former four-term city councillor, I know that Canadian municipalities face major infrastructure deficits. They need more support from the federal government and have suffered years of neglect. Infrastructure is crumbling. These historic investments in transit, social, and green infrastructure would go a long way to addressing these issues. They would put Canadians to work, and they would give them safer cities and homes to live in. As an added bonus, infrastructure projects use steel, which is produced in my riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176307">Ridings across this country also have Canadians who are struggling to make ends meet, to find enough funds to raise their kids, and to save for their future. In Sault Ste. Marie, I know this is the case. This government's commitment to creating a larger tax-free child benefit that would raise 315,000 kids out of poverty is critical. The government showed on Wednesday that it would strengthen the middle class by providing it with a middle class tax cut, which would benefit roughly nine million Canadians every year. This is just part of the government's plan to implement real change for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176308">Our government is investing in the future of our children and giving families more money to save, invest, and grow the economy. It is well known that when middle-class Canadians do well, they spend their money locally. They benefit local businesses and, in turn, help to boost the economies and create jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176309">In Sault Ste. Marie, we need middle-class people to do well, but we also need to help those who are struggling or down on their luck. Not only is this government committed to creating jobs through investment in infrastructure, but it is mentioned in the Speech from the Throne that the government will strengthen the employment insurance system. We will ensure that the EI system serves the economy and Canadians. As someone who has worked hard in my community to ensure the economic success of everyone, I am particularly proud of this. People in Sault Ste. Marie and across Canada need a social safety net that is there for them so they can get back on their feet; and an effective EI system is a good initial step toward that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176310">I am also proud that this government will work with the provinces and territories on a number of initiatives, including, but not limited to, providing more income security when people retire, reducing post-secondary costs, developing a new health accord, and reducing carbon pollution. In short, Canadians do better when our governments work together. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176311">We need to invest in our country and Canadians and in industries that continue to sustain us for generations to come. That is exactly what this government is committed to doing, and the Speech from the Throne is evidence of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176312">Once again, I would like to thank the people of Sault Ste. Marie for electing me. I look forward to working with all members of this House to improve the economy and, in particular, the success of the steel industry in Canada. It is time we elevated the discussion around the importance of the domestic steel industry in Canada, and I look forward to working with all members.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4176314">Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the House adopted Bill <Document DbId="8064045" Type="3">C-3, An Act for granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money for the federal public administration for the financial year ending March 31, 2016</Document>. As is our practice, I rose to place a question to the <Affiliation DbId="214341" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation> during the committee of the whole. I asked him if he could confirm if the bill was in its usual form and the President of the Treasury Board replied, “The form of this bill is, in fact, the same as that passed in the previous supply period”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176315">I checked the Journals Branch this morning and the copy of the bill that was adopted by the House of Commons did not include the schedules that contain the actual amounts in the supplementary estimates. It would appear that we did not actually grant for Her Majesty certain sums of money for the federal public administration for the financial year ending March 31, because the bill was not in fact presented in its complete form, having excluded the schedule which provides for the authorization the House must actually give.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176316">Originating with the Magna Carta, the Crown cannot spend what the people do not approve through their elected representatives in the House of Commons. That is probably the most important foundation in public finance. Therefore, if information about that spending is not properly included in the legislation adopted in the House, then the Government of Canada does not have the authorization to spend the money that it does. That is the first point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176317"> The second point is that the <Affiliation DbId="214341" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation> took great lengths to say that he would “surprise” me by actually answering the question. In fact, he did surprise me and he did answer the question, but then he surprised me again today by virtue of the fact that his answer was incorrect. I looked back at the schedule of the previous supply bill that was passed by the House of Commons and the schedule was in fact present, which is contrary to the words the President of the Treasury Board uttered when he said that the form of the bill was the same as that passed in the previous supply period. We now know that this is not accurate and that the President of the Treasury Board has misled the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176318">This of course creates a dilemma because the schedule has not been adopted by the House and it is one for which I do not have a solution, but it is one that I am obliged, as a member of the House of Commons, to bring to your attention, Mr. Speaker, and to the attention of the House.</ParaText>

Also, in the last Liberal government, the NATO low level flying was ended at that base. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176627">Our government kept 5 Wing alive and invested in its infrastructure and other needs. However, the throne speech said clearly that the military is going to be a leaner military; we know on this side that means cuts. The Liberals almost closed 5 Wing Goose Bay in its last government, and I truly fear, despite the member's passion, it is on the chopping block already.

              <ParaText id="4176628">Mr. Speaker, that is a very important question, and I am happy to speak to it. The difference between the previous government and our government is that we see opportunity in the future, and there is tremendous opportunity in 5 Wing Goose Bay to serve as part of the Arctic and northern mission. That is something that the former government did not see as an opportunity for that base and the people in that part of the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176629">In fact, it was the previous government that continued to dismantle bases like 5 Wing Goose Bay. It tore down dozens and dozens of buildings and houses, and started to dismantle the entire base. Our job is going to be to strengthen military defence in the country, which we intend to do, and ensure that we make good use of the facilities and properties we have. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4176630">Mr. Speaker, the hon. member made mention in her speech of the importance of a renewed nation-to-nation relationship with indigenous people, the Inuit and Métis communities. In my community, we have the missing and murdered women coalition. The coalition has worked long and hard. It is comprised of family members, community advocates, and women's organizations. It has advocated for a national inquiry for a very long time. We finally now have an opportunity for that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176631">One of the things we must learn from this is not to make the same mistakes that the B.C. government made with the Oppal inquiry. Therefore, the missing and murdered aboriginal women coalition is asking for three things. First, it is asking that the government ensure that the mandate actually looks into the root causes of violence against indigenous women and girls. Second is that the family members and the organizations that have expertise and knowledge around the issue be funded, supported, and resourced, and given the opportunity to participate in the inquiry so that they are not shut out from that process. Third is to ensure that there is commitment and the resources to implement those recommendations coming out of the inquiry </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176632">I wonder if the parliamentary secretary could respond to those three points and make that commitment to the coalition and the family members. </ParaText>

We know the value of doing this piece of work, but we also know the value of doing it right. That includes consulting with the families, which is ongoing at this stage. It will continue to be ongoing. As well, we will be consulting with others who have expertise to ensure that the inquiry will meet the needs, produce the outcomes, and see the follow-through that is required in order to do this successfully to ensure we honour the victims and heal the families. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4176634">Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my good friend, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214272" Type="2">Edmonton Riverbend</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176635">It is a true privilege to rise in the House with my maiden speech in response to the government's Speech from the Throne.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176636">At the outset, I would like to thank the tens of thousands of people in the St. Albert—Edmonton riding for placing their trust and confidence in me. I can assure them that I will work every single day to do my very best to represent their interests here in Ottawa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176637">Like every other hon. member in the House, I did not get here on my own. I got here because of the hundreds and hundreds of people who offered their support, commitment, and assistance, not just during the campaign but over the course of my entire life, in helping to shape the person I am today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176638"> While it is not possible to thank each and every one of those individuals, I do want to pay tribute to and thank my family. In particular, I would like to thank my parents, Tom and Rita Cooper. At an early age, they instilled in me the importance of hard work, the value of education, and the need to be engaged and involved. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176639">Indeed, it was they who encouraged me to get involved in the political process at a young age. They saw that I had been quite interested in politics and suggested that, rather than sit on the sidelines, I should roll up my sleeves. They themselves had never been politically active. I took their advice, and at the age of 14 I joined the Alberta provincial Progressive Conservative Party. I guess I have never really looked back since, in terms of my political involvement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176640">I would like to acknowledge my brother, Timothy Cooper, who is a medical doctor presently completing his residency in the area of the ear, nose, and throat at the University of Alberta, for his lifelong friendship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176641">I would also like to acknowledge my paternal grandparents, who came to Canada from Ireland, and my maternal grandparents, who fled communism and came to Canada from Lithuania. Like so many people from all around the world who come to make Canada home, they did not have much monetarily, but what they did have was a strong desire to work hard, contribute to Canadian society, and build a better life for their families. For that, I wish to pay tribute to their legacies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176642">I also wish to acknowledge Mary O'Neill, the former MLA for St. Albert, as well Doug Horner, the former MLA for Spruce Grove—St. Albert, who served in a number of cabinet portfolios, including deputy premier and minister of finance in the Government of Alberta. Both Mary and Doug are people with whom I first got involved and whom I supported in their campaigns. Over the years, they have been tremendous political mentors, and I was so very proud that they stood with me both during the nomination and during the election campaign.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176643">I would also like to acknowledge Dr. Richard Plain, the former mayor of St. Albert, who served ably as my campaign manager during both the nomination and the general election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176644">Last but not least, I would like to acknowledge the partners of the Edmonton law firm, Ogilvie LLP, for their support and understanding as I tried to balance, on the one hand, a busy civil litigation practice with the demands of seeking elected office.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4176645">With that, I turn to the substance of my speech, namely, responding to the government's Speech from the Throne.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176646">The Speech from the Throne accurately stated that Canadians want to trust their government. If anything is clear in less than two months, it is very clear that Canadians cannot trust the Liberal government. The list of broken promises in less than two months is truly breathtaking. With each new day seems to come a new Liberal broken promise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176647">One such broken promise was the government's commitment to run a $10 billion deficit in this fiscal year. It now looks as if we are looking at about a $1.2 billion shortfall. It may be billions of dollars more to pay for the government's spending spree. Who is going to pay for the government's spending spree? Well, of course, it will be working Canadians, because after all there is only one taxpayer, something that the Liberal government seems to have already forgotten about, if the members knew it in the first place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176648">For working Canadians, living in Canada is going to become much more expensive thanks to the Liberal government. How is it going to be more expensive, one may ask? The government wants to impose a carbon tax. It wants to hike payroll taxes. It wants to eliminate income splitting for single income families. It wants to eliminate the universal child care benefit. It wants to roll back TFSAs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176649">It is clear that the government has no plan and no vision other than job-killing, tax-and-spend, redistributed schemes. This is evidenced by the fact that there was no mention in the Speech from the Throne about the trans-Pacific partnership, the biggest trade deal in Canadian history, which is going to allow Canadian businesses to get their products to market, to 800 million consumers, duty-free, but the government did not even bother to mention it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176650">There was no mention of Alberta's vital energy sector. There was no mention about any meaningful strategy to create jobs to get the economy growing and to get Canadians back to work. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176651">When it comes to keeping Canadians safe, the government has been equally shortsighted. The greatest security threat to Canada comes from ISIS. ISIS is responsible for slaughtering tens of thousands of people in Iraq, Syria, and around the world. Entire villages have been upended and literally rivers of blood flow in Iraq and Syria, and yet the government's response is to cut and run by pulling out the CF-18s. The <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="214305" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation>, and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> cannot explain how that is going to assist the international coalition to defeat ISIS. The reason is that it is completely unhelpful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176652">I say to hon. members opposite, in closing, that in terms of a road to prosperity, it does not come by spending more, by regulating more, by taxing more, and by redistributing more. It comes from being fiscally responsible and trusting taxpayers and creating the conditions for growth.</ParaText>

I have a couple of questions to put to him, because we have just come through an election campaign in which Canadians made some decisions, I think in large part because they saw what the record of the previous government was. The record of the previous government was the largest deficits in Canadian history, the largest trade deficits in Canadian history, and probably most significant, the largest debt load on average Canadian families that we have ever seen in Canadian history.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4176673"> With respect to deficits, it is true that the former government did run some deficits, but it was in the context of the worst global economic recession in decades; so there was some short-term stimulus spending that allowed Canada to turn around and grow at a faster rate than any country in the world, leading to long-term growth and prosperity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176674">I should remind the hon. member that, as far as debt to GDP ratio is concerned, Canada has the lowest debt to GDP ratio in the industrialized world thanks to the Conservative government. I do not apologize for the record of those nine years.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4176677">As a new member, it is a real honour to be here to offer my thoughts on the throne speech on behalf of the people of Vaughan—Woodbridge, but before I do, it is important to add some context to my remarks and explain why I am here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176678">Earlier this week, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said that the throne speech was about what matters most for the people who matter the most. By delivering a throne speech with an emphasis on giving a hand up to students, seniors, communities, and families, this government is setting out a plan for our future and for the future of our children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176679">Fifty years ago, my grandparents left Southern Italy with nothing but what they could carry. They arrived at Pier 21 in Halifax with only a strong work ethic and a desire for a better future for their seven children. One of those children, my mother Vincenza, married my father Rocco and set out to build a life together. They worked hard and sacrificed every day. They transformed their entrepreneurial spirit and drive into a good and productive life because Canada allowed them to do it. They worked hard and Canada provided the opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176680">I am concerned that the kind of opportunities my parents and I had may not be within the reach of my daughters. As a father and husband, I am eager to make sure that my two wonderful daughters, Eliana and Natalia, grow up and have the chance to succeed. Certainly my wife Rose and I have worked hard to provide for our children, but like many families across Canada, a helping hand from a government that cares would make all the difference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176681">I understand there are those who would have us believe that hard work alone is enough to guarantee success, but that is not true. Hard work is a big part of it, but so is opportunity. This is why I ran for office. It is why I am happy to support the throne speech, because it promises opportunity for those who are willing to work hard. Most members here would agree that families and communities are the building blocks of this nation. I am immensely proud to be here representing the families of Vaughan—Woodbridge, but for too long, families and communities have been missing out. Better is always possible and it is time to put real people on the road to real change, change for the better, and that starts now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176682">Before I continue, I should again take a moment to thank the people of Vaughan—Woodbridge for their trust and support. This is my first opportunity to speak as a member of the House, but I temper each of my comments with the input and support that I have received from those I represent, and I thank them for their help, for their support, and for their trust. It is important for my constituents to know that this throne speech speaks to the priorities that are important to people living on Chancellor Drive, Davos Road, and Maria Antonia Road, and everywhere in-between. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176683">This is not a throne speech written in Ottawa. Instead, it is a throne speech that takes its inspiration from the coffee shops, kitchen tables, and workplaces of this great country. This throne speech is for all Canadians. The focus of this new government is on good jobs, safe streets, and opportunity for all. I say to the people of Vaughan—Woodbridge that these are their priorities and they are mine, too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176684">Last week, this government delivered a throne speech that focused its energy entirely on the middle class, people like those living in my riding. This government recommitted to helping low-income seniors, students, families, and workers across Canada. It committed to using every mechanism at its disposal to create jobs, improve services, and restore Canada's glory for all citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176685">The middle class has not had a decent raise in years, and it is time for our working families and the unemployed to catch a break. It is time to again create a place where hard work can and will spark opportunity that delivers prosperity to everyone. This is what real change looks like and it is precisely what the government wants to achieve. I have heard critics to my left say that government should stand back and let the free market take over. I reject this hands-off approach because it ignores those at the bottom end of the income scale. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176686">Certainly the world of international finance is not one that I am a stranger to. I have worked on Wall Street and Bay Street for nearly 25 years. I know the economy grows only with a strong middle class. Instead of sitting back, this government is doing what it can do to grow the middle class, invest in infrastructure to alleviate the gridlock that is choking our economy, to provide a clean environment, and to strengthen retirement security for all.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4176687">These are goals that we can and should all get behind, not because they are Liberal commitments but because they will strengthen us all. Canadians elected a government to bring us together. Canada is strong because of our differences, not in spite of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176688"> It is also true that the new Canada child benefit will direct substantial help to those who need it the most, and I am proud of this part of our platform. The new Canada child benefit will provide increased benefits to 9 out of every 10 families in Canada. The benefit will be tax-free and, most importantly, it will lift 300,000 children out of poverty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176689">Why is this important? Why not continue to pursue the short-sighted policies of the past? Why not allow the markets to decide everything?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176690"> Quite simply, there are too many Canadians who work two or three jobs with little benefits and still live in poverty. To make matters worse, public infrastructure is crumbling. The manufacturing sector is shrinking. Household debt is skyrocketing, and the cost of basic essentials continues to rise. These things are putting unimaginable pressure on the people I represent: families, students, and seniors, and this throne speech is trying to set things right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176691">This is the first debate of many, but it is tremendously important because it will set the tone for everything that comes next. New investments in public transit, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, and secure pensions each promise real and meaningful change for the residents I was elected to serve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176692"> With this in mind, and with my wife Rose and our two daughters, Eliana and Natalia, watching, I am excited to support this throne speech, not just as a document, but as a plan for real change. I am pleased to vote in support of this blueprint for tomorrow because of what it represents for seniors, students, families, and workers in my riding and ridings in every part of Canada.</ParaText>

If the government is sincere about getting to a balanced budget by the end of its mandate, it will have to do one of those two things. It will either have to raise taxes dramatically or cut services.</ParaText>

For that, I admire you, and I challenge you to hold our Parliament to one of the greatest parliaments in Canadian history. It will not be easy, but you have my full support. I pledge this to you. If I make the grave mistake in the pursuit of heckling across the aisle, I will ensure that it is done in the most stealthy of fashions so you will never know it was me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176722">I am here and ultimately humbled, at the age of 34, to have been elected both provincially and federally. Of that I can be proud. However, what I am most proud of are two very smart, thoughtful, and generous little girls, Molly and Lily Jeneroux. These are my girls and my reason for being here. I recognize this is a world where we need people to put service before self and I am proud of who they are at the ages of six and eight, but I cannot wait to meet them as they grow into what I am certain will be remarkable young women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176723"> Speaking of remarkable young women, I am also incredibly lucky to have the most beautiful, thoughtful and most kind person in love with me, my partner in life and all things, and soon to be Dr. Elizabeth Clement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176724">I also want to recognize the former member of Parliament for my region, James Rajotte. He is a man of great principles and dedication to our country. I am deeply honoured and humbled to be following him in this chair. He is a man who knows how to work hard, and that is a trait I plan to carry forward to represent our nation's best constituents, those from my home in Edmonton Riverbend. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176725"> However, this is where I would like to stop talking about me. Quite frankly, there are much more important things to talk about. I would like to focus this time—my time—to speak on what the Speech from the Throne means to our future generations. I thought it might be interesting because, quite simply, I get both excited and scared for our future leaders. I am excited because I truly feel there is nothing they cannot accomplish, but also scared because we are a country that is admired by so many in this world for its freedom and prosperity. It is the decisions we do not make today that could put all that at risk. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176726">However, we are only a generation away from losing this way of life that we have worked so hard to achieve. I want our future generations to have a better life, a successful life. Let us take the message forward together. Deep down, we all have a dream for what Canada can become in the next 20 to 50 years, but we need to take responsibility for that dream. I challenge our future generations to make their dreams for our country a reality. I challenge them to say “yes” to their dreams, not to settle for mediocrity, and to work hard. Things in this life are not easy. They are hard. Do what is hard. Trust me that it will be worth the work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176727"> There are many distractions in this world: Facebook, Twitter, social media. However, for our future generations, they should focus on their goals and dreams. They are responsible to our country to do just that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176728">Our future generations are certain to face many difficult challenges in the years to come. However, I want them to remember, each and every day, to embrace the Canada they want to see. There will be thousands of people lined up around each and every corner to tell them no, but they should not listen. I want our future generations to push themselves to do better, to be better for this world, and to be better for us. It is hard to push oneself, but that is the point: do what is hard. Their integrity and their honour are what define them. They should never let anyone tell them they cannot do something. If they want something, work hard. It is honestly that simple. I want our future generations to remember these words, as what we do inside this chamber for all of them is not something anyone of us should ever forget. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176729"> I want to focus my remaining comments on my home province of Alberta.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176730"> I have grown up in a province that has taken action, a province that does a lot of the heavy lifting for the economy, but a province that is under attack both by its own NDP government and the federal Liberal government. I am fearful for our future there. If people do not believe me, the very decision to remove the responsibilities for the west and roll them into a minister from Toronto does not sit well with everyday Albertans. There are decisions like giving up on pipelines and tankers on the west coast. I ask members to please not take these decisions lightly. These decisions impact the lives and futures of many. I also ask members to please not make a political decision. The west is truly Canada's land of opportunity during economic hardships and we can be that way again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176731">We need a government that will join with us across the aisle and fight to ensure we have the jobs, the people, and ultimately the support to bring forward the next era of the golden west. We have been the strongest economic region in North America for the past 10 years. For the men and women who have lost their jobs in the oil patch, this Conservative team is here for them. For the farmers feeling threatened in their way of life, this Conservative team is here for them. For the working moms and dads who are now bracing for the burden of more debt, I pledge to them that this Conservative team is here for them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4176733"> However, our time is limited here and I want to ensure we are all here considering our future leaders. I want all members of this chamber to ensure we are making the best decisions in here that will enhance their way of life. Decisions being made here already are being based more on political ideology and electioneering, more so than thinking of our daughters, sons, grandkids, and my kids.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176734"> With references to marijuana, CBC funding, and electoral reform all outnumbering jobs in the Speech from the Throne, I am concerned and downright disappointed that the Liberal government has already failed Canadians, not giving any opportunity or chance to enhance our way of life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176735"> Finally, I would like to end with the challenge to the members on the government side to work hard as we build on what our forefathers have left before us. It will not be easy, but this job should not be easy. Future generations are watching and future generations rely on the very decisions we make.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176736"> We are all humans put together to make up the House of Commons. We will forever be bonded together. Let us not forget that. It takes courage to work together.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4176761">Mr. Speaker, as this is the first time that I am rising in this honourable House, I would like to take the opportunity to thank all the residents of Mississauga—Streetsville for electing me to be their voice here in Ottawa. I would also like to thank my family, past and present, for their unwavering support. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176762">Over the last two years, I was able to speak with thousands of residents. More importantly, I had the opportunity to listen to their concerns, concerns that were addressed in the Speech from the Throne.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176763">The riding of Mississauga—Streetsville is home to various areas: Lisgar, Levi Creek, Meadowvale, and the quaint areas of Streetsville, and old Meadowvale Village. It is with great pride that I stand here and say that I grew up in Streetsville and I am now the member of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176764">However, this middle-class riding has faced a number of challenges in the past. I have spoken with single parents who find it difficult to provide for their children. Having volunteered at both the Eden and Seva food banks, I have seen families struggling day to day to make ends meet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176765">In a country as wealthy as Canada, every child deserves to have access to the essentials of life. This is why it gives me great pride to have heard in the Speech from the Throne that our commitment to the Canada child benefit will raise 315,000 children out of poverty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176766">We are also committed to creating more opportunities for young Canadians. One of the biggest concerns that parents have in the riding of Mississauga—Streetsville is that their children will not have the same opportunities that they did. It is imperative that future generations are educated in order to ensure the continued prosperity of our great nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176767">In addition to hearing the concerns of our residents, I have also consulted with the mayor of Mississauga, city councillors, and our provincial counterparts. In order for the riding to thrive, the municipality requires dedicated and predictable funding for infrastructure with an emphasis on transit investments. Those living in my riding who work in downtown Toronto can barely make it back for dinner. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176768">On July 6, 2013, we all watched in horror the tragic events of Lac-Mégantic's derailment. Residents of Mississauga—Streetsville were shocked to hear that that very train passed through our backyards and our shopping centres. This particular issue was once again brought to the forefront as a similar train caught fire during the campaign. That train was situated between shopping centres, a day care, and the backyards of some residents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176769">Another concern in regards to infrastructure is that of affordable housing. Social and affordable housing currently has a seven-to-ten year wait time in Mississauga. Our riding also has multiple co-op housing units. My colleagues and I visited one of these co-ops and were surprised to learn that they only required a mere $50,000 in government assistance to keep a lot of those people from being kicked out onto the street. This is why our infrastructure investment of $125 billion is not just an investment in infrastructure, but an investment in Canadian families. Ultimately, we need a federal government that respects municipalities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176770">During this previous election, I was contacted by various groups and individuals of all parties to discuss electoral reform. Residents often felt their vote could potentially be wasted. When our party announced that 2015 would be the last election under the first past the post voting system, it was an announcement that our government is going to be one that listens to the concerns of citizens, has progressive views, and is truly about real change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176771">Some of my fondest memories of growing up in the riding involve our parks and trails. Our riding has a multitude of green spaces, conservation lands, bike paths, ponds, and a lake, and of course, the Credit River. I often take my cousins along with me to tree planting events so that not only can they enjoy these spaces, but understand how we need to preserve them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176772">This government has committed to preserving the environment and will take on climate change. As mentioned in the Speech from the Throne, we will make decisions that are informed by scientific evidence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176773"> Our government will introduce new environmental assessment processes. However, most importantly, our government understands that a clean environment and a strong economy go hand in hand.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4176774">The government's agenda also reflects that Canada's strength is its diversity. There is no greater testament to this than me standing here today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176775">Canada truly is the land of opportunity. My dad moved here from India to give his family a better life. From odd jobs, to driving a taxi, saving, and eventually growing his own small business, Canada rewarded him for all his hard work and ambition. My younger brother is an emergency room doctor and saves lives every day. I am a lawyer and small business owner, and have the honour of being a member of Parliament. Only in Canada is that possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176776">I was very fortunate to have the opportunity to attend law school in London, England. One of the benefits of studying abroad is easy travelling to neighbouring countries. Back then, when people found out I was a Canadian they greeted me with warmth and mentioned how Canada is so well known for being a peacekeeping nation. However, that sentiment has been lost for many years now. Our government will contribute to greater peace throughout the world and renew our commitment to United Nations peacekeeping operations. Inevitably, this will restore our reputation on the world stage as those who stand up against intolerance and keep the peace. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176777">Here at home, many of my constituents have told me they moved from their country of origin because Canada is safe. Naturally, this is ideal to grow a family. Recognizing this, the government will continue to work to keep all Canadians safe. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176778">I would like to again thank all my constituents for electing me their member for Mississauga—Streetsville. The riding actually mirrors that of Canada. It is full of history, commerce, is ethnically diverse, and home to small villages within a large city. I could not be prouder to call it home. I know that our mandate will serve the people of the riding well. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4176779">Mr. Speaker, I have a question about taxes mentioned in the throne speech. The middle-income tax cut excludes about 70% of Canadians, while eliminating the expanded TFSA. We wait for the other shoe to drop, which means higher taxes to pay for the spending it is committing to and the new schemes that we have yet to see in the House, which will mean less savings for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176780">We know that nearly 11 million Canadians took advantage of the TFSA, 60% of whom were holders earning less than $60,000 a year. More than half of them were seniors. When people are empowered financially they save for the future. We know this from experience. What we do not need is a cradle-to-grave, two-nanny state system. We all heard about this in the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176781">There was a BMO survey report released in September that found that 56% of respondents had less than $10,000 available in emergency funds. I think the TFSA is an amazing program. Keeping it at $10,000 ensures that Canadians can save for themselves. Therefore, why will his government not reverse its decision and restore the TFSA, the best new savings vehicle in a generation?</ParaText>

Mississauga—Streetsville, within the GTA, is an expensive place to live.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4176793">Members speaking in this place use third-party terminology, which is a bit different. I have two tips for hon. members when they are in the course of either questions and comments or in the course of their speech. If hon. members find themselves wanting to use the words “you” or “your”, which is a common occurrence that comes up in normal language, in the House we tend to flip to the “hon. member” or “hon. members”, as the case may be. A second way to help with that is, when members direct their commentary generally toward the Chair, they pivot toward the Chair, so they will not necessarily have the hon. member to whom they are addressing their comments in full view, and they will be less likely to use the words “you" or "your”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176794">That is just a tip for hon. members. I know it is a bit of an adjustment, but members are doing splendidly, I must say.</ParaText>

We have also held the prestigious title of Agri-Food Capital of Québec for a long time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176800">I, along with many Canadians, listened closely to the throne speech. I was happy with a number of commitments this government made, but there were some omissions, and I was disappointed by other aspects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176801">Agriculture is a very strong economic driver in my riding. Saint-Hyacinthe is known around the world for being an agrifood technopole, in particular because it is home to educational institutions, such as the CEGEP, the Institut de technologie agroalimentaire, and the only French-language veterinary medicine faculty in North America. It is also home to research centres and a number of biotechnology innovation companies. Agriculture is the backbone of our economy back home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176802">On a daily basis, I hear from farmers who are worried about the trans-Pacific partnership. I am concerned that the Liberals still seem prepared to move forward with the Conservatives' trans-Pacific partnership agreement. This agreement will put our farmers at risk. In my riding, in the RCM of Les Maskoutains alone, more than 250 family businesses will be affected by this agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176803">Furthermore, although the Liberals made an election promise, I did not hear anything in the throne speech about holding public consultations anytime soon. There was also nothing about the compensation promised to the farmers who will suffer the consequences of this agreement. I must admit that people back home are very worried.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176804">In my riding of Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, a number of major infrastructure projects are waiting for federal funding. This government promised Canadians change—rapid, urgent, and positive change—in how it does things. It promised to make massive investments in infrastructure, among other things. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176805">In my riding, we need a rail overpass on Casavant Boulevard in Saint-Hyacinthe. This project is vital to the economic development of the city because it will open up the industrial park. We have been waiting for federal funding for this project for over 10 years. I am very familiar with this file as I was a municipal councillor in Saint-Hyacinthe for six years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176806">The City of Saint-Hyacinthe invested more than $20 million in a ring road, which is located in my area and presently leads to a dead end because of the rail line. Furthermore, negotiations between the city and CN are difficult, if not impossible, and the railway's demands account for most of the project's cost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176807">The Casavant Boulevard extension is necessary for the development and growth of Saint-Hyacinthe. It is critical that the federal government act quickly and decisively on this file so that we can build this road infrastructure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176808">Another major project is currently under way in Saint-Hyacinthe. In 2012, a shock wave went through the business tourism industry in my region with the closing of a large hotel complex. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4176809">Many jobs were lost, and many businesses felt the sting. Now we are all working together to help the sector recover. With support from the federal and provincial governments, the City of Saint-Hyacinthe hopes to build a brand-new convention centre adjacent to a new hotel. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176810">This partnership would help revitalize Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot's business tourism industry and create lots of good jobs while strengthening the city's business sector. This partnership includes the Société d'agriculture de Saint-Hyacinthe, which already has a fair centre. Together, the convention centre and the fair centre will make Saint-Hyacinthe the biggest destination for such events other than Montreal and Quebec City. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176811">The city of Saint-Pie is working on making a new community centre proposal a reality. This infrastructure project connects recreational and community activities, schools and the municipal library. This is a good example of a community that is taking action to make the most of the available resources to truly improve life for families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176812">Once again, this is a major project that deserves the government's attention and shows how urgent it is to implement an infrastructure funding program that is both generous and flexible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176813">These major projects, to name a few, are very important to my riding. I expect the government to commit adequate funding to help the communities achieve their full economic development potential based on their own priorities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4176815">I listened closely to the Speech from the Throne and the measures that relate to my responsibilities as critic. I am pleased to hear that the government is going to improve the Canada pension plan after so many years of Conservative inaction. However, I must admit that I was very disappointed to see that there was no mention in the Speech from the Throne of the fight against poverty here in Canada and no mention of a plan to fight poverty and reduce inequality in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176816">I did not hear anything about the promise to improve the guaranteed income supplement to help lift seniors out of poverty or anything about cancelling the cuts to old age security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176817">I also did not hear the government announce any measures to change the retirement age back from 67 to 65.

We are going to improve the Canada pension plan. We are going to build more housing for seniors, and there are huge amounts for home care. At the other end of the spectrum, the poorest of the poor, we will be dealing with the homeless with the biggest influx of housing infrastructure in history. For our children, of course, probably the most important of all, nine out of ten families will be helped by the biggest child benefit in history, which will take 300,000 children out of poverty.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4176835">Mr. Speaker, we are here in the House to make decisions. Obviously, when we make certain things a priority, other things have to be set aside. I think that the priorities pertaining to the fight against poverty are important. Canadians decided to elect a Liberal government that announced that it was willing to incur a deficit. The minute the Liberals made big infrastructure promises, they created a lot of expectation in our communities. The two RCMs that I represent invited me to meet with them in the coming weeks, because they have their lists ready. The government created a lot of expectation in our communities. Obviously, we will have difficult choices to make. It is important to always keep that in mind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176836">Since the member who asked me the question also worked at the municipal level, he knows how difficult it is to set a budget and make choices.

We are here to make decisions. The questions that I asked this week have to do with where I think the government's priorities should lie.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4176837">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to rise to speak for the first time. I would like to begin by thanking the voters of South Okanagan—West Kootenay for placing their trust in me to speak for them in the chamber. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176838">I would especially like to thank the many volunteers who worked hard to elect me as the first MP in the big, beautiful riding of South Okanagan—West Kootenay. I also thank my wife Margaret, who was one of the hardest working of those volunteers and has always been a pillar of strength for me. As well, I would like to mention the hard work of Alex Atamanenko, the respected and newly retired MP for the old riding of <Affiliation DbId="78664" Type="2">British Columbia Southern Interior</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176839">As someone born and raised there, I am somewhat biased, but I think that my riding, from the vineyards and orchards of the South Okanagan, the ponderosa pines of the Kettle, the big Columbia River rolling through the West Kootenay, and the ice-capped peaks soaring above the Slocan and Arrow Lakes, has to be the most beautiful riding in the country. As an ecologist, I love both its diversity and uniqueness since it is home to a host of species found nowhere else in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176840">It is also the unceded territory of the Syilx, Sinixt, and Ktunaxa peoples, and we are all the richer for their traditions, culture, and knowledge. Other communities add to that cultural diversity, including the Indo-Canadian and Portuguese communities in the South Okanagan, the Doukhobors of Grand Forks and Castlegar, and the big Italian community centred on Trail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176841">While it is beautiful, my riding faces serious challenges. From the desert grasslands of the South Okanagan to the forests of the West Kootenay, climate change is bringing longer, hotter summers, shallower snowpacks, and more frequent wildfires. Just this summer, the communities of Oliver, Osoyoos, Grand Forks, and Christina Lake were threatened by a series of fires. One catastrophic fire destroyed 30 homes in the village of Rock Creek. I want to take this opportunity to register in the chamber the thanks that my constituents give to the brave men and women who fought those fires and the many volunteers who fed and housed both the firefighters and the residents who had been forced from their homes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176842">Climate change is a clear concern to the residents of my riding, and I hope that the government backs the elegant words about climate change in the throne speech with a clear plan, bold targets, and prompt action. Hotter summers and diminishing rainfall are also forcing local agricultural operations to adapt quickly to remain competitive. Agriculture has always been the heart of the economy in the western half of my riding. I grew up on a small apple orchard, and the region is justly proud of its apricots, peaches, cherries, wine grapes, tomatoes, peppers, melons, apples, and beef. Many local residents are concerned about food security issues. I was deeply disappointed, therefore, to note that agriculture was not mentioned once in the throne speech. I sincerely hope that the government will take up the national food security strategy prepared by the NDP in the previous parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176843">South Okanagan—West Kootenay is a very important tourist destination, with its sparkling lakes, sandy beaches, hiking and biking trails, rock climbing opportunities, and world-class ski hills. Tourism is a huge part of our economy, not just in my riding but across this spectacular country. I have to say I was disappointed to see that there was not one mention of it in the throne speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176844">We need to market our country more skilfully, and I have to give a shout-out here to the Thompson Okanagan Tourism Association for its cutting-edge marketing programs. The federal government would do well to invest in programs such as these through a larger contribution to Destination Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176845">As is the case across this country, natural resources are a big part of the economy of South Okanagan—West Kootenay, from the huge Teck smelters in Trail to the Celgar mill in Castlegar, and other mining and forestry operations throughout the riding.</ParaText>

Real estate prices are relatively high, and that factor, combined with the generally low wage rates across the riding, results in a large population of constituents who are struggling to make ends meet. Affordable housing and homelessness are big issues in all of my communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176849">Seniors also make up a very large part of the <Affiliation DbId="214446" Type="2">South Okanagan—West Kootenay</Affiliation> population. Many of them have inadequate pensions, and the health issues that go along with an elderly demographic have been straining our health care system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176850">Young people also face a difficult future in this riding. Some had left for the energy sector jobs in northeastern British Columbia and Alberta, but as that sector contracts, many have returned home, hoping to find similar work. Hopefully they have listened to the government's promises of infrastructure funding and investments in green technology that could change the face of hundreds of communities across this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176851">Many others have gone on to post-secondary education. Some go to large universities outside the riding, while others go into apprenticeships and the trades. Many attend Okanagan College and Selkirk College, two fine post-secondary institutions in this riding. They are well known for their innovative programs, such as the sustainable construction program at Okanagan College, and the rural pre-med program at Selkirk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176852">To be a successful country in the 21st century, Canada needs to provide its young people with a grade A education, so I am also proud that I am the NDP post-secondary education critic. The Speech from the Throne briefly mentioned the plight of students facing increasing debt loads, but we must look at the root cause of these debts, the soaring tuition rates caused by a long-term decline in federal funding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176853">In the last election, Canadians voted for change. In that long campaign, the Liberals promised much regarding the environment, a more positive role in foreign affairs, and social infrastructure, housing, poverty reduction, pension reform, and health care. The people of my riding will be watching the government closely to make sure it delivers on those promises. As part of the NDP progressive opposition, I will also be watching over the coming months. We remain optimistic and hopeful, but we will be diligent in holding the government to account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176854">Now I will simply say merry Christmas to all, and I hope everyone in this chamber and across the country has a happy and healthy new year.</ParaText>

It is part of the dry interior of British Columbia that is one of the very last ecoregions of Canada that does not have a national park. There has been an initiative now over 10 years, since I think 2003, to initiate a national park in that area. I very much would like to see that move forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176866">Parks Canada has been developing policy over the last decade to move the park idea forward, while protecting the livelihoods of ranchers and other stakeholders, and involve local first nations in close collaboration with that. I look forward to meeting with my provincial counterparts in the riding to move that idea forward.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4176868">I would like to thank the Speaker for the opportunity to address this assembly for the first time to give a speech in debate in the House. I congratulate you, Mr. Speaker, and all members for their for successful elections.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176869">As someone who has had a successful career in brain research and is a passionate advocate for brain and mental health, I would like to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="170111" Type="2">Ottawa—Vanier</Affiliation> for the courage he displayed as he announced his diagnosis of ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. His fearless announcement put a spotlight on neurodegenerative diseases, and for that I am personally thankful to him. I wish him all the best that research, hope, and my family's prayers can offer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176870">I would be remiss if I did not thank my predecessors who were present during the 41st Parliament, <Affiliation DbId="208787" Type="2">Pat Perkins</Affiliation> and the late <Affiliation DbId="78379" Type="2">Hon. Jim Flaherty</Affiliation>, who represented the town of Whitby and the villages of Brooklin, Ashburn, and Myrtle with extraordinary passion, conviction, and pride.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176871">Ten years ago my husband, Vidal, and I decided to make Whitby our home. Over the course of the past 10 years, we have benefited from the friendships of our neighbours, access to top-quality schools for our three children, Desiray, Candice, and Johnny, and a retreat to a tranquil and embracing community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176872">The people of Whitby have placed their trust in me through a piece of paper, a pencil, and a vote. I am forever grateful and humbled by their confidence in my ability to be their voice here in Ottawa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176873">Whitby is a growing town with changing demographics, a strong chamber of commerce, a business community, wonderful academic institutions, both local and within the Durham region, and world-renowned health and recreation facilities, like Ontario Shores Centre for Mental Health Science and the Abilities Centre.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176874">Therefore, in this, my first address to the chamber, I would like to highlight a few of Whitby's assets to the national and international community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176875">Over 50% of Whitby's population has completed post-secondary education. We have access to highways 401 and 407, literally wrapping around our town. Its great institutions, like Durham College, for example, have a direct impact on the economic and social well-being of Whitby, the Durham region, and the province of Ontario. The economic impact of Durham College is greater than $800 million annually, and it has countless partnerships with businesses and other organizations in order to provide meaningful skills and experience to its students.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176876">With our government's commitment to invest in public transit and social and green infrastructure, create jobs, and strengthen the middle class, the opportunities are endless for growth in Whitby's economy, because strong local economies lead to a strong national economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176877">Whitby has recently been named one of Canada's best places for business, earning the fifth out of ten spots on Profit magazine's 2015 list. By leveraging our existing assets, national and international businesses can rest assured that an investment in Whitby is one that will yield mutually beneficial positive returns for years to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176878">That being said, over 70% of the people in Whitby work outside our town. That is why I am proud that this government has committed to an infrastructure investment and public transit investment that could help create local jobs and keep the people of Whitby living, working, and playing in their own communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176879">I will also highlight the men and women in uniform of the Whitby Fire Fighters IAFF Local 2036, the Durham Regional Police Services, Durham Region Emergency Medical Services, and the men and women in uniform across the country who need continuous and ongoing health support, especially related to PTSD. Daily, they run toward the kinds of situations and circumstances that make us run away. They deserve our unwavering support. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="10">(1410)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4176880">I am so happy that our government has pledged to give our men and women in uniform the support they need, and is committed to be a leader in this regard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176881">Further, mental health and addictions in Canada have devastating social and economic impacts. They are complex health issues that affect education, social services, employment, housing, and justice. In order to move forward with treatment and ultimately healing effectively, we must include all of those social systems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176882">I am encouraged by the desire of centres of excellence, like Ontario Shores in Whitby, to eagerly seek out collaboration in my riding to find new and innovative ways to improve treatment and care for those dealing with complex mental health issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176883">I want to mention how proud I am of Ms. Beth Mah's grade 11 class at Donald A. Wilson Secondary School in Whitby who wrote a letter to our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> asking, among other things, that we think about including courses in school that address the whole student, including their mental health and stress management. These young leaders recognize the importance of mental health and I wanted to mention them today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176884">Lastly, I want to speak about Whitby's senior population. We have heard for many years that we will be faced with a number of issues related to the ever-increasing senior population. It is time we did something about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176885"> I applaud the Speech from the Throne's commitment to giving seniors a more secure retirement and supporting the health and well-being of Canadians with the development of a new health accord.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176886"> I believe that an integrated multidisciplinary approach to care is vital for our population. Complex and chronic care facilities are needed in order to ease the burden of our acute care hospitals. However, there is also a need to leverage the value of a home care strategy, which effectively utilizes the services of nurse practitioners in order to not only decrease health care costs, but allow our seniors in Whitby and across Canada to stay at home longer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176887">It is my honour and commitment to let this chamber know that the town of Whitby is not just a great place to be from, but it is a great place to be. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176888">Again, I wish to thank the residents of Whitby and you, Mr. Speaker.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4176908">Given that this is my maiden speech in this historic place, I would like to say what a privilege it is to rise and speak in the heart of our Canadian democracy. I want to thank the many friends and volunteers who were part of my election team. If had not been for each and every one of them, I would not be here today. They worked tirelessly for me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176909">I also want to thank my family. As so many of my colleagues have noted, it is not possible to do this job without the support of our loved ones. I want to thank my son David, my three sisters, and my 95-year-old mother, who watches this every day. They were with me every step of the way and provided the love and encouragement that I needed to make it here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176910">First, I want to thank the people of the new riding of Long Range Mountains for placing their trust in me as their first member of Parliament. Long Range Mountains is made up of nearly 200 communities scattered all along the western and southwestern part of the beautiful island of Newfoundland. Many of these communities were originally founded as small fishing villages. Their continued sense of community and tradition is a testament to the commitment, resiliency, and character of Newfoundlanders throughout our riding. My parents, both native Newfoundlanders, instilled in me these same ideals of hard work, giving back, and perseverance, and I want all of my constituents to know that I will be a strong, positive voice for them here in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176911">It is an honour to rise in the House today in support of our government's throne speech. The priorities that it lays out should make all Canadians as proud of our government as it makes me. Each of these commitments will create a positive impact throughout our great country, and especially in my riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176912"> As our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has said, there is no relationship more important to Canada than with our indigenous peoples. The commitment to re-engaging with our indigenous peoples in a nation-to-nation relationship based on respect, co-operation, and recognition of rights is essential to the Canadian mosaic evolving in the 21st century. As the member for Long Range Mountains, this is particularly important to me because it will be a new dialogue with the Qalipu Mi'kmaq First Nation Band.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176913">Our government's commitment to transparency and openness is what will hold us to account and give Canadians the faith in government that has been absent for far too long. This is especially relevant in Newfoundland and Labrador, where broken promises have led to the relationship with federal representatives being at a historic low for far too many years. Nowhere is this felt more clearly than in the historic Newfoundland fishery. There is no question that the declines in past years of certain areas of the industry have hurt many of my constituents. When we speak with them, and I have spoken with thousands in the last 14 months, they will say that what has made the situation even worse was a lack of consultation with local groups and the lack of evidence-based policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176914">Our government's commitment to open, transparent, and science-based decision-making will mean a new approach to all issues, including fisheries issues. It will be an approach that engages the local communities. It will empower scientists and promote the role of science in the process. This will allow for a prosperous, stable, and, most importantly, sustainable fishery for generations to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176915">I am sure that all of my colleagues heard from their constituents about rising housing prices, increasing costs of living, and stagnant wages. Many Canadians are struggling to get by, and that is no different in my riding. That is why I am so proud of our government's plan to grow and sustain the middle class.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176916">Moreover, the pledge to nearly double infrastructure spending over the next ten years will make a significant difference in ridings across the country, especially in rural ridings like Long Range Mountains. We have a historic opportunity to make an investment in our future if we act now. Together, working with our municipalities and provincial and territorial partners, we will make a difference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176917">Agriculture is another pillar of the economy in my riding of Long Range Mountains, as it is in many ridings throughout the country. Investments in our crumbling roads and bridges will allow farmers and our fishermen to get the products to market more quickly and more cheaply. They will also provide the resources for our small resources to compete in global markets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176918">Broadband access is just as important. Throughout the Long Range Mountains, and in many rural communities across Canada, there is limited or no access to high-speed Internet. Without this access, it is difficult for our small businesses to compete. It limits their ability to reach new markets and conduct day-to-day business. It also limits education in communities and reduces the capabilities of our health care system. Remote care is quite common for seniors in my province, especially in the rural areas.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="25">(1425)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4176919">These investments are not just an investment in our economy of today. They are a investment in our economy of tomorrow. If we are willing to seize this unique opportunity we will empower our children to succeed in the future and, hopefully, they too will improve our country for the next generation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176920">This idea of investing in our future was present throughout the throne speech. Our government has proposed an ambitious agenda, based on a vision of Canada that we all share. It is a vision of economic growth, driven by our middle class, of equal opportunity for all our children. It is looking after our seniors and preserving our environment for our next generation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176921">This agenda does not just make moral sense. This makes economic sense. Accounting for 80% of all new jobs created across the country, small and medium-sized businesses are the biggest driver of economic growth in Canada. To continue to grow our economy, we must invest in our small businesses and empower them with the resources they need to succeed in an increasingly competitive global economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176922">As a small business operator in Newfoundland and Labrador, I understand the challenges our small businesses are facing. Today's economy is built on ideas and innovation, and in order to succeed it is essential for small businesses to have access to a highly skilled workforce. That is why I was very pleased to see the priority of working with territorial and provincial leaders to make post-secondary education more affordable. Whether it is the skilled trades, college, or university, post-secondary education is the key to our youth succeeding in today's economy. In the Long Range Mountains, we are lucky to have three top flight post-secondary institutions: Memorial University's Grenfell Campus, the College of the North Atlantic, and Academy Canada. By working to make post-secondary education more affordable, we can ensure that our small businesses can harness their talents to build an economy that will be competitive not just today but for decades to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176923">I would like to touch on Memorial University and the Grenfell Campus for a minute. The Grenfell Campus is located in Corner Brook. It was named after Sir Wilfred Grenfell, a medical missionary on the rugged coast of Newfoundland and Labrador. Memorial University itself was founded in honour of the 1,500 Newfoundlander and Labradorian soldiers who died fighting in the first world war. It was named by their mothers. They wanted to commemorate their sacrifice, and their memories live on in Memorial University. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176924">We will always remember our fallen and we will always be proud of those who choose to serve, just as we all are of our Canadian Forces. I was very pleased that the additional support for veterans will mean the reopening of the Veterans Affairs offices throughout the country, one of which is in my riding of Corner Brook. These offices are an important source of care and assistance for the hundreds of thousands of veterans across the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176925">The throne speech laid out the theme of investing in our future. Perhaps nowhere is this more important than our relationship with our environment. The pledges in the throne speech to tackle climate change and to focus on the growing economy while protecting our environment are great steps forward for all Canadians. We are lucky to be blessed with a beautiful country and an abundance of resources. By caring for both we will preserve these treasures for the next generation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176926">In my riding of Long Range Mountains, we enjoy two UNESCO world heritage sites, L'Anse aux Meadows and Gros Morne National Park. Both of these sites, and the many other tourism treasures, contribute to the growing tourism industry, to our small businesses and, most importantly, to our culture and heritage, which is a tad unique in Newfoundland and Labrador. I am thrilled our government has placed a priority on protecting our environment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176927">I believe the Speech from the Throne laid out an ambitious agenda with a vision that Canadians share, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on both side of the aisle delivering for the constituents of the Long Range Mountains and for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4176928">As I am the last speaker for today, I would like to take this opportunity to say merry Christmas. Have a safe and happy holiday. We will see everyone in the new year. </ParaText>
