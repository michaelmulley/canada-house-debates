            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4487857">Madam Speaker, it is a great honour to rise today in support of Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document>, an act to establish the national security and intelligence committee of parliamentarians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487858">The proposed legislation fulfills a key campaign promise of the 2015 election, and represents a thoughtful and long overdue modernization of Canada's security framework.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487859">Allow me to begin by referring to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s mandate letter to the <Affiliation DbId="214300" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness</Affiliation>, which unambiguously referenced the overarching goal of “keeping Canadians safe”. It reads:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487860">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">This goal must be pursued while protecting the rights of Canadians, and with an appreciation that threats to public security arise from many sources, including natural disasters, inadequate regulations, crime, terrorism, weather-related emergencies, and public health emergencies.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487861">What we are discussing here today is at the intersection of defence policy, foreign policy, and national security. The rationale behind this mandate is self-evident. We live in a world of new, ever-evolving, and unprecedented security threats. Just this past March, a lone wolf attack on a Canadian Forces recruitment centre in my riding of Willowdale underscored this point. While I am grateful for the incredible bravery and professionalism the RCMP and others displayed in responding to the attack, the fact remains we are largely operating in a brave new world where groups and individuals can pose serious challenges to our safety and security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487862">Meeting these challenges, while maintaining our respect for the cherished rights and freedoms of Canadians, requires a robust and responsible parliamentary framework. While the previous government curiously failed to recognize this, something I can assure members I heard repeatedly on doorsteps, it is my belief that Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> rectifies the obvious gaps within our existing security framework, namely, by establishing a national security and intelligence committee of parliamentarians. This committee would be provided extraordinary access to national security information and an unprecedented ability to scrutinize federal departments and operations. In doing so, Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> rejects the notion that we must choose between prioritizing security concerns on the one hand and respecting civil and charter rights on the other. Rather, it establishes a framework that balances both.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487863">The issue of accountability boils down to this. Does Canada have the institutions it needs to protect the safety of Canadians, while at the same time safeguarding our rights and freedoms? Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> ensures that we can answer that question in the affirmative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487864">The concept of establishing a parliamentary security oversight committee is hardly novel. The idea can be traced as far back as the 1981 McDonald commission report, while more recent efforts include a 2003 Auditor General's report, recommendations from the 2004 Interim Committee of Parliamentarians on National Security, the 2005 national security committee of parliamentarians act, a 2009 recommendation from the House of Commons public safety committee, a 2011 Senate report, and private members' bills introduced in 2007, 2009, 2013, and 2014, most recently by my Liberal colleagues from<Affiliation DbId="213979" Type="2"> Malpeque</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="213894" Type="2">Vancouver Quadra</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487865">Over the past decade, these efforts were repeatedly obstructed and denied by the previous Conservative government, despite widespread support amongst experts, stakeholders, academics, non-governmental organizations, and the Canadian public. While there is no making up for this lost decade, I am proud to say that Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> finally provides Canadians with a modern and meaningful security oversight mechanism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487866"> In keeping with our government's commitment to evidence-based decision-making, Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> notably aligns Canada's security regime with accepted international best practices. As colleagues before me have highlighted, Canada is currently the only member of the Five Eyes alliance lacking a security oversight committee that grants sitting legislators access to confidential national security information. In an era in which security threats are increasingly global and interdependent, Canada cannot afford to be an outlier on this issue. This absence of oversight has limited the ability of parliamentarians to examine national security issues in depth. The previous government argued that there was no need for parliamentarians to have access to confidential national security information. On this side of the House, we disagree. Giving parliamentarians access to such information will benefit Canadians who want their government to be open and transparent, including our national security agencies. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4487867">As Professors Craig Forcese of the University of Ottawa and Kent Roach of the University of Toronto recently noted in their working paper to modernize Canada's inadequate review of national security, a robust national review framework rests on three pillars. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487868"> First is a properly resourced and empowered committee of parliamentarians with robust access to secret information, charged primarily with strategic issues, including an emphasis on efficacy review. Second is a consolidated and enhanced expert review body, a security and intelligence community reviewer or super SIRC with all-of-government jurisdiction, capable of raising efficacy issues but charged primarily with proprietary review. Third is an independent monitor of national security law, built on the U.K. and Australian models, with robust access to secret information and charged with expert analysis of Canada's anti-terrorism and national security legislation and able to work in concert with the other bodies on specific issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487869">It is my belief that the bill meets these criteria. Professor Forcese would appear to agree, writing as he did that Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> represents a good bill. He goes on to say that it creates a stronger body than the U.K. and Australian equivalents and that it constitutes “a dramatic change for Canadian national security accountability”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487870">I believe the legislation is well intentioned, well considered, and well rounded. In particular, I would like to highlight five notable elements of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487871">First, Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> allows the committee to analyze and study laws, policies, and operations in real time, increasing the discipline, responsiveness, and accountability of our security framework.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487872">Second, the legislation before us tasks the committee with the invaluable capacity to monitor classified security and intelligence activities and report findings to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. Rather than reviewing security activities on an ad hoc and siloed department-by-department basis, Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> provides the opportunity for comprehensive security oversight. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487873">Third, the provisions regarding ministerial discretion on limits to access to information contained within the bill are clearly delineated and follow the best practice models established by the United States, Australia, and others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487874">Fourth, Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> guarantees that the government will constitute a minority within the national security and intelligence committee of parliamentarians, thus ensuring increased accountability. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487875">Finally, and perhaps most significant, Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> represents an important counterbalance to the sweeping powers introduced through Bill <Document DbId="6842344" Type="3">C-51</Document>. Indeed, as I mentioned earlier, the bill represents the fulfillment of a key campaign pledge on the part of the government to rein in the excesses of Bill <Document DbId="6842344" Type="3">C-51</Document>, while ensuring the collective security of all Canadians. The introduction of a committee of parliamentarians tasked with overseeing Canadian security and intelligence represents a much-needed return to accountability. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487876">The bill, however, merely represents one part of the puzzle. Our government has also committed to amending Bill <Document DbId="6842344" Type="3">C-51</Document> to better protect the rights of assembly and protest, and to better define rules regarding terrorist propaganda, mandating statutory review of national security legislation, creating an office of community outreach and counter-radicalization, and increased consultations with Canadians from coast to coast on how best to balance security concerns and civil liberties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487877">This process, both within and outside Parliament, will allow us to strengthen the security and intelligence system of Canada. It will also provide Canadians with confidence that in protecting their safety and security, the government stands firmly behind their rights and freedoms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487878">I urge all hon. members of the House to join me in supporting the bill.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4487882">To rectify the situation, we looked at models adopted by other allies, crucially, the Five Eyes. Of course, it would have been impossible for us to adopt a framework that would simply cut and paste provisions that have been adopted by the other Five Eyes. In this particular instance, obviously there are variations between our framework and those of the other Five Eyes.</ParaText>

International issues such as cultural diversity, global warming, and tax evasion are all serious issues that demand international co-operation.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4487894">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join this debate on Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document>, the national security and intelligence committee of parliamentarians act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487895">Above all else, governments must be able to ensure the safety and security of the citizens they serve. All of us here in this place share in this duty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487896">Our public safety institutions take many forms and have different resources to fulfill their different mandates. Day in and day out, the people who keep us safe work to balance national security concerns with the privacy rights that Canadians expect and deserve. They do an excellent job. They work diligently under challenging circumstances and deserve our gratitude.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487897">The bill being considered here today would create a statutory committee of parliamentarians appointed by the executive branch and housed within it. In Canada, the executive branch is the Prime Minister's Office and the Privy Council Office that supports it. This would be a committee of parliamentarians and not a parliamentary committee. The difference is important because one is able to decide its mandate while the other cannot. A parliamentary committee is the master of its own affairs and has standing orders and practices. The members of a parliamentary committee are named by each member's whip and not by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. The chair of a parliamentary committee is elected by its members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487898">This new national security and intelligence committee would have none of that. According to the government's press release, the committee would have a mandate to scrutinize any matter related to the national security of Canada. Unfortunately, the fine print is not as generous concerning the responsibilities that the committee and its members will have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487899">Under the bill, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his ministers will be allowed to withhold information requested by the committee if they consider that the disclosure of the requested information would negatively impact national security. However, while the responsible minister would be expected to provide the committee with the rationale on his or her decision to hold back information, in practice this will not work. We cannot ask for something if we do not know it exists. If we are told that something exists but we cannot see it because of national security concerns, the entire point of having a committee to reinforce the oversight of Canada's security apparatus disappears. A member, or anyone for that matter, cannot be expected to work with only partial information. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487900">As prescribed in the bill, the committee would be a creation of the executive branch and its dealings would be kept secret. Therefore, it is difficult to identify what resources the members of the committee would have at their disposal if they were dissatisfied or frustrated in their role. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487901">Furthermore, if members of the committee have a major concern with the information they receive in testimony or through a brief, they can only report their concerns to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> or the minister responsible. Presuming that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> does not share the same security concern, he does not have to act on it, and members cannot bring their trepidation to the elected House of Commons, or to anyone for that matter, because they have been sworn to secrecy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487902">The way that this committee would be set up makes me think of the philosophical thought experiment of “If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?” If members cannot speak about what they have been briefed on, does it even matter that they have been briefed?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487903">While it may be premature to speculate on what the committee will actually do, it is no stretch to imagine that the committee will meet semi-regularly and be given access to documents and testimony that an already existing parliamentary committee would receive and members could access via access to information requests. Assuming that the committee finds itself in agreement on recommendations, the government will review the committee's report before it can be tabled in Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487904">If the purpose of the committee is indeed to provide elected members of Parliament with a greater role in overseeing Canada's national security institutions, then I do not understand why the inputs and the outputs of the committee will be screened by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487905">Given how the government is proposing to structure this committee, I am unsure of whether the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> believes that elected members of Parliament can be trusted to steward the information they receive with care and discretion.</ParaText>

This is problematic, as we have already heard during this debate. It reinforces the impression that the committee is just a PMO working group. It is understood that a chair of a committee plays a critical role as the spokesperson for the matters that are directed to the committee, and committee reports are published through the chair. In order for the committee to be successful and have legitimacy, I believe that the chair must be chosen by members of the committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487908">I understand that in a majority government situation, as we find ourselves in right now, the members of the governing party will never select an opposition member as their chair. Interestingly, while we are debating the bill, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has already appointed the member for <Affiliation DbId="214297" Type="2">Ottawa South</Affiliation> to chair the committee. That is a clear sign that the government is unwilling to compromise on this specific aspect of the legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487909">Taking this into consideration, together with the bill before us, more than anything the committee appears to be a make-work project for members of Parliament and a way for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to deflect any criticism on his action, or inaction for that matter, on national security matters. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487910">I would like to conclude by making a few remarks about the role of members of Parliament and how the legislation fits into a disturbing trend that I have observed over the past 11 months. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487911">Members, even if they were elected as members of the governing party, have not been elected to serve the government. The legislation serves to reverse this relationship by making members work for the government. While members of the governing party argue that the government is giving parliamentarians access to more information, Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document>, in its current form, makes it difficult to believe. The real test of whether the committee would have any teeth and impact on policy would be on whether it can freely report its findings with the weight of Parliament behind it. Again, the bill ensures that this simply would not happen because the prime minister and his ministers would be able to read any report from the committee before it is made public, if it is made public at all. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487912">Ultimately, the bill's stated purpose is to empower members of Parliament. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the government will take the advice and concerns of members from all parties, which have been seriously raised, into consideration as we move forward.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4487926">It is my pleasure to rise in the House today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document>, the national security and intelligence committee of parliamentarians act. This bill is of incredible importance and is part of this government's larger plan to rectify the Harper Conservatives' flawed attempt at anti-terrorism legislation, which infringes upon our most basic rights in a bad attempt to make Canadians safer. I am happy to see this piece of legislation, which was promised in the last election and which I believe an overwhelming number of Canadians support, before the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487927">I am proud to represent the riding of Kingston and the Islands and have always enjoyed engaging with constituents on matters of importance to them.

              <ParaText id="4487928">Although it is true that the government must be equipped to adequately meet the security challenges of the day, it must never lose sight of its responsibility to be accountable to Canadians. </ParaText>

The government has listened and is delivering on this important promise. I believe that this legislation ensures faithful compliance with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and is in line with what Canadians elected this government to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487930">In my opinion, Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> is required to establish accountability and to ensure that Canadians' rights and freedoms are respected. Reforming the flawed provisions enacted by the Harper government is crucial in protecting Canadians' rights and freedom of expression, which is of the utmost importance in a healthy democracy. Bill <Document DbId="6842344" Type="3">C-51</Document> set the course to erode this most fundamental right, a right that should never be taken lightly and should always be guarded with the utmost respect. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487931">Canadians pride themselves on living in a democratic country, and they deserve their government respecting their rights and freedoms, period. The legislation before us sets the stage for ensuring that those rights and freedoms are respected while at the same time Canadians are protected from the changing reality of the serious threats posed throughout the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487932">I am proud to stand with a government that does not use the politics of fear. I am proud to support a government whose policies are based on evidence and fact. It would be much easier to scare Canadians into believing that certain measures were paramount for their safety, as the previous government did, even if the measures meant infringing upon their most basic rights and freedoms. This government will not do that. It will not use fear to advance its political agenda, as we have seen in the past.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487933">What we see before us today is the proper way to establish safety and security while respecting the rights of Canadians. These changes are long overdue, and I am glad to see this government fulfilling a promise to Canadians: to protect Canada's national security and rights and freedoms while at the same time protecting us from the realities of a changing world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487934">I listened carefully to the debate in the House throughout this week and heard concerns about the openness and accountability of the committee proposed in this legislation. Let me assure everyone that I, too, expect the government to be accountable, and that is why I see this legislation as a necessity. This legislation strikes the right balance. It would protect Canada's national security while allowing for accountable oversight for Canadians. This legislation has the proper checks and balances in place to address the concerns raised in the House during the debate this week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487935">The national security and intelligence committee of parliamentarians would have representation from both the upper house and the lower house and would be charged with having non-partisan responsibility for reporting on security matters in the interest of all Canadians. Members of this committee would be granted unprecedented access to classified material to adequately carry out their mandate.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="35">(1035)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4487936">With the current challenges Canada faces, this would be a crucial step in ensuring that Canada is prepared for what the future brings. By creating the national security committee of parliamentarians, the government would be ensuring that there was appropriate oversight and accountability moving forward. Specifically, this committee would have the ability to review the full range of national security activities, including all departments and agencies across the Government of Canada, and would be able to gain a full picture of what is being done by those government agencies in national security and intelligence matters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487937">Committees have been referred to as the backbone of Parliament. This committee would work to ensure that our national security was effective in keeping Canadians safe and that Canadians' rights were safeguarded. In fact, Canada is currently the only Five Eyes ally without parliamentary review. The U.S., U.K., Australia, and New Zealand all have committees similar to the one proposed in this bill. Many of our allies formed these committees in the late 1980s and 1990s. That means that Canada is already lagging behind our allies. We are long overdue for setting up this oversight, which is in the best interest of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487938"> Actually, I am proud to see the broad scope of this committee, and I believe that it has the potential to be a stronger body than those seen in other countries. This is significant for Canada, as it has the potential to be most effective committee within the Five Eyes group.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487939">Something else caught my attention. On Tuesday, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="214021" Type="2">Louis-Hébert</Affiliation> pointed out that four former prime ministers, both Liberal and Conservative, have recommended that an oversight committee be formed. All four have called for an independent committee to review the actions of our intelligence agencies, but that is not all. Four Supreme Court justices and four former ministers also support the concept of this committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487940">I am proud to join with those former prime ministers, Supreme Court justices, and justice ministers, as well as the current government and Canadians from across this country, in supporting this bill. This is not a place for blind partisanship but is an opportunity to fix our currently flawed system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487941">As one of my colleagues across the aisle said earlier in this debate, good oversight not only builds public trust but must make our security services much more effective. That is exactly what this legislation allows for. This committee would provide the oversight necessary to maintain accountability and to ensure that Canadians' safety and rights are maintained.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487942">I urge all my colleagues to put their partisanship aside and see this important bill passed in this House. I see no reason why this legislation should not receive all-party approval.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="214674" Type="18">Mr. Bill Blair (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4487959">Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to rise in the House today to speak in support of Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22, An Act to establish the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians</Document>. With this bill, our government would fulfill a key commitment it made to Canadians to ensure that our national security framework is working effectively to keep Canadians safe, and to ensure that our rights and freedoms are safeguarded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487960">Far too often, I have heard in the House that the great imperatives of every government to keep its citizens safe and to safeguard their rights and freedoms is being spoken of as if we are required to make a choice, a compromise, or a calculation. The very nature of the public discourse suggests that it may be necessary to sacrifice one in order to achieve the other. I respectfully disagree. I believe it is the responsibility of every government, and by that I mean every member of the House, to ensure that we achieve both safety and freedom in equal measure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487961">I have had the opportunity over the course of my life to be involved in operational matters of national security. From these operational matters, I want to share some of my experience. There is always a tension between those who are responsible for gathering national security intelligence, those responsible for gathering evidence for prosecutions, and those who are responsible for ensuring that nothing bad happens in any of our communities. That tension is often resolved through certain guiding principles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487962">The principles that guide the work of those dedicated men and women who are responsible for keeping our communities safe while adhering to the rule of law are precisely these things, including the highest in this country, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It is their responsibility not only to obey those laws but to uphold them, to uphold them to be respected and honoured throughout the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487963">We are also guided by the important principles of public interest. It is important that those who are responsible for keeping us safe do the right thing. That means, of course, not merely obeying the law, because this can lead to situations that in my old business we used to call “lawful but awful”, but respecting the public interest, ensuring that we are doing the right things and in a way that will engender the respect and trust of the public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487964">That brings me to the most important principle that always has to guide the work of those responsible for and tasked with keeping our communities safe, and that is maintaining the public trust. Maintaining the public trust is based upon a number of things. Certainly the rule of law and acting in the public interest are important, but it also requires transparency and accountability. This is particularly difficult in circumstances where the work is done in secret, where we are engaged in activities that are clandestine, covert, or are classified and secret, when it is not in the public interest to disclose to the public what we know or the means by which we came to know it. It is not in the public interest for that information to become known to those who would do harm in our communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487965">How can the public be assured that those tasked with safeguarding their security and their rights obeyed the rule of law and acted in the public interest? It comes down to who guards the guards. I believe that Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> would allow for a more fulsome answer to this critical question in Canadian governance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487966">I have been the beneficiary of both good governance and bad governance, and I can say from my experience that doing the job right requires good governance. Indeed, the effective operation of a national security framework requires that we have in place governance and oversight mechanisms that work for us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487967">We already have a fairly robust system of oversight for national security. We have ministerial oversight, and many of our laws require the explicit consent of the relevant minister for those enforcement and intelligence-gathering agencies to proceed and for those involved to do their job. Much of their work requires judicial oversight to ensure that certain legal thresholds are met. The organizations and the individuals who are responsible for this work are guided by internal policy. In addition to that, we have other important review bodies. CSIS, for example, is governed and overseen by the Security Intelligence Review Committee, which has access to certain classified information to review the work of CSIS. The work of our RCMP officers and other police services is subject to the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission and other oversight bodies to ensure that they are obeying the rule of law and acting in the public interest. CSE is overseen by the Office of the Communications Security Establishment Commissioner.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="50">(1050)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4487968">In addition to that work, Parliament has a number of parliamentary committees. Here it is important to acknowledge that the committee being proposed in Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> would not be a committee of Parliament. It would not be a committee of either house of Parliament. Instead, it would be an additional review mechanism to assure Canadians that we are effective in our oversight and control of the extraordinary powers that are given.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487969">I can tell the House from my experience that those who are tasked with this responsibility welcome oversight. They welcome that accountability. It is important to them that oversight and governance exist, because without public trust in the important work they will be doing, they cannot succeed in their dual mission of both maintaining safety and upholding the rights of our citizens. This measure is an important one to fulfill our commitment to provide effective governance and oversight of national security matters and to protect the rights and freedoms of our citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487970">The committee, from its proposed composition in the bill, would be an effective mechanism to ensure that matters are dealt with across various government agencies. In my experience, keeping our country safe and upholding our laws and freedoms is the responsibility not of a single agency of government, but of all agencies of government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4487971">In far too many cases we have seen that oversight by one body is insufficient to review all of the activities of those other bodies engaged in this important activity, and that as a result there have been a number of gaps in information sharing, and our effectiveness has been compromised. Through the introduction of this new review committee, our government will be able to assure Canadians that those gaps are closed and that all committees are operating in a collaborative and more effective way.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4487980">Madam Speaker, from my experience in dealing with matters of national security, I know that in order to be held accountable and to hold others accountable, it is important to have the right information at the right time. However, operational matters, because of their very nature, do require that certain information and certain types of intelligence gathering and certain ongoing operations remain secret. That is very much in the public interest. Nonetheless, I think we are making a huge step forward in creating greater transparency and far greater accountability.</ParaText>

We watched as stagnant rates in Canada on smoking continued. This means that about 37,000 die every year in the leading cause of preventable death. To give an idea of scope, that is the equivalent of an entire riding disappearing every three years.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4488288">I stand here after reading hours of previous debate from this parliament as well as previous parliaments, media reviews of this bill as well as the bill itself. The bill is extremely misleading and should have a disclaimer that states, "Read the small print.” The bill truly deceives Canadians. The government has deceived Canadians by introducing a bill that would not provide true parliamentary oversight, but is a facade that it is doing something.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488289">Just a year ago many members of the House sat through electoral debates. It was during this time that the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> campaigned on real change and less power of the PMO. Yet, in this bill, the Prime Minister would have even greater power than we can even imagine when it comes to the actual inner workings of the proposed committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488290">Let us start by pointing out that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> would personally choose the chair of the committee, and he chose that member and provided a handsome bonus for this position. Let us point out that the makeup of the committee would not be like one of the standing committees in the House of Commons. These committee members would be approved by the Prime Minister. This committee would only be able to receive information approved by the Prime Minister and his cabinet. This committee would report directly to the Prime Minister, and the report that would be tabled in Parliament would be vetted by the Prime Minister. Let us not forget the Prime Minister would have the right to edit this report. I truly think I see a theme in these things that I am stating.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488291">On another note, this committee would be made up of parliamentarians who would not require any experience in security, policing, or defence. Am I wrong for thinking that a hand-chosen committee with political imbalance is right for Canada?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488292">I would like to point out that the information that would be reviewed by the parliamentarian committee would already have been cleansed by the cabinet and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.

              <ParaText id="4488295">We all understand that there would be sensitive information presented to this committee. However, the fact that the committee would not be seen to have this privilege is very disturbing. My thoughts on this committee can be compared to a family dinner. The committee is not old enough and not wise enough to sit at the grown-ups' table. As well, how could there be true oversight if the information received were already edited? It is sort of like reading a letter that has black marker all over it, except in this case it would be done all by the Prime Minister's Office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488296">I am unsure if the members of the committee would even know there was edited information that they would be receiving, so that when it came to them it would already have been edited so therefore they would not have all points of view and they would not have the opportunity to look at all of the information necessary to make the appropriate decisions. I say that because there has been little information provided on this actual committee, just the limitations it would be given.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488297">The government is introducing a committee to be more transparent to Canadians, the Liberals say. However, we know that transparency is truly not the case here. I speak as an average Canadian with the honour of representing the great constituents of Elgin—Middlesex—London, an average Canadian who hopes the government will recognize this flawed bill and make important amendments, such as the amendment requests that were presented to the <Affiliation DbId="214300" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness</Affiliation> and completely ignored, amendments that were not only reviewed by the official opposition but were shared with the critic for the NDP for its input as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488298">These suggestions include: a set number of members and senators; the ability for the committee to summon any witness required; the election of the chair; the request that all parties should have the right to select members who have the necessary experience and who are familiar with security, intelligence, and defence issues; and as well become a member of Her Majesty's Privy Council and swear an oath of secrecy for the work conducted.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4488299">These are just some of the suggestions presented to the minister, and as I just stated, with no response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488300">Changing gears, I have reviewed numerous suggestions indicating some sort of support for the bill. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association supports the introduction of the bill; however, it notes that there are many considerations that need to be addressed. These include the government's power to halt a committee investigation, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister's</Affiliation> power to redact the committee's report, as well as the decision that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> personally appoint the chair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488301">A law professor at the University of Ottawa, Craig Forcese, has stated that he has concerns about the government’s ability to veto the committee’s plans, limit its ability to see secret materials, and redact its reports. A University of Ottawa historian stated that this is a “good bill”, but he too adds that the real test will be finding the right members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488302">Even when people look at the bill who actually support it, they too have questions. We have seen academics, lawyers, and many people react to the bill by saying that it is just not right. It needs to have amendments made to it, and it needs to have suggestions from the opposition parties as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488303"> The bill is not perfect. Therefore, I urge the <Affiliation DbId="214300" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> to start looking at these suggestions and start listening to the opposition members. My colleagues and I are not saying that third-party oversight is not important, but we see a government setting up a new branch of the PMO, not a committee that is allowed to do its job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488304">Currently, there are watchdogs in place, including the Security Intelligence Review Committee that reviews CSIS, the CSE commissioner who reviews the Communications Security Establishment, and the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission that reviews the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488305">This is a committee that is not and will not have the tools and resources available to be effective. This committee already has limitations set out by the Liberal government. The committee is already hampered by the government's decision on the development of the parliamentarian committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488306">I ask my colleagues to review this piece of legislation and proposal for the committee, and ask themselves whether this is what Canadians are really looking for. Did they ask for a committee that is another branch of the Prime Minister's Office, or did they ask for third-party oversight? Did they ask for hand-picked members, including a hand-picked chair that reports to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> directly, or did they want to see a committee that truly has the rights of a committee and can do its work with all resources available to them?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488307">The legislation is very worrisome to me. If the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is hand-picking, then can we be sure that he is not also setting the agenda? How can we be sure that the agenda is allowed to be scrutinized by members, ministers, and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself, or is this committee just fluff?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488308">I am not against watchdogs and whistleblowers. However, the legislation is not that at all. The legislation would not provide the true parliamentary oversight that is necessary. This committee is window dressing, and it does not have the teeth to be able to do anything. This committee reports to one person and one person alone, and that person is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada. It is he who will decide what is actually tabled in the House. National Security is extremely important and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> would not allow the committee to do its work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488309">I urge the <Affiliation DbId="214300" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> to scrutinize the bill and provide something to Parliament that is meaningful. I urge the minister to work with all members, government and opposition, to do what is best for all Canadians. Please work with the recommendations made by former security lawyers, our Armed Forces members, and former RCMP and police officials, who now sit in the House, to make this a better piece of legislation that we can all support.</ParaText>

As the member stated, it is not the same sort of parliamentary committee as in those other Houses. We have a hand-picked committee, whereas for the others, it is a committee similar to a standing committee of the House. Its members have the rights of committee members and the resources. The problem is that we cannot compare apples to oranges. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4488327">Mr. Speaker, in light of some of the reports we have heard on CBC over the past week, clearly, it seems appropriate to ask some questions. There were reports of incredible abuses committed against Canadian citizens who were literally sent to be tortured at the request of various Canadian agencies. That is precisely why I am pleased to rise here today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> at second reading.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488328">My good friend, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214384" Type="2">Victoria</Affiliation>, has been handling this issue skilfully and intelligently. I will therefore be voting in favour of the bill at this stage so that it can be studied further in committee. As always, that is where the real work is done for the benefit of Quebeckers and Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488329">We certainly commend the government's initiative in bringing this bill forward. Not only does it respond to a very clear call from various commissions of inquiry over the past several decades, but it also fulfills a promise made during the election campaign last fall regarding some recent issues. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488330">This bill to create a national security and intelligence committee of parliamentarians is crucial. The committee has to be formed not only with the greatest of care, but also with the necessary tools to be credible in the eyes of everyone, citizens and politicians alike, as well on the international stage. Half measures are not an option.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488331">When it comes to credibility and legitimacy regarding national security, the truth is that the previous Conservative government missed the mark with Bill <Document DbId="6842344" Type="3">C-51</Document> in the last Parliament. They went in exactly the wrong direction. A critical mass of national security experts were against that bill that was rammed through. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488332">The NDP was the only party that firmly opposed this bill, and Canadians overwhelmingly rejected this intrusive approach that did nothing to balance national security with the protection of the individual freedoms of Quebeckers and Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488333">Let us be clear: the Liberals have to keep their promise to get rid of the problematic provisions in Bill <Document DbId="6842344" Type="3">C-51</Document>. We will hold them to it. If we as parliamentarians, and the government MPs in particular, want to win back the trust of Quebeckers and Canadians, then this is definitely the right first step.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488334">Honestly, the public's trust in our institutions should be among the primary objectives of Canada's security policy. Let me explain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488335">We live in a world that is constantly evolving and, unfortunately, as shown by the tragic events in Istanbul, London, New York, Paris, and Brussels, it is unpredictable and quite dangerous. The length of this list should be enough to attest to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488336">We must ensure that our national security organizations, the RCMP, CSE, and CSIS, have the necessary tools and resources to do their job, but that they also do not operate without administrative transparency, so that Canadians can know that they are effective and that they protect Canadians' rights in the best possible way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488337">Make no mistake, the world in which we live is not a John le Carré or Ian Fleming novel set in the cold war. The duty to protect is particularly important, but entails a responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488338">I agree, our national security organizations already have oversight bodies, but the truth is that these bodies operate somewhat haphazardly and do not have full and systematic access to sensitive information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488339">The mandate of oversight and review bodies is limited to examining the work of their target organization. They are unable to follow the thread that connects them to various government organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488340"> I want to remind everyone that the annual budget for CSIS, the RCMP, and CSE is close to $4 billion. That responsibility, not to mention the significant amount of taxpayer money involved, justifies the creation of this committee of parliamentarians. I know that every MP represents his or her constituents admirably. That is the spirit in which the members of this parliamentary committee will be tasked with overseeing these operations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488341">To get back to my first point, the committee must be put together very carefully. All of our allies have parliamentary committees for international security, but they differ in their makeup and especially in their mandate. We can learn from both their experience and their flaws to ensure that our review committee is robust.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488342">Quebeckers and Canadians want a watchdog with sharp teeth. The new committee must have full access to classified information, sufficient resources, and independence. Within reasonable limits, it must be able to share its findings with Canadians in an informative and transparent way. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488343">Twelve years ago, an interim committee of parliamentarians on national security recommended that, should such a committee be created, it should have complete access to all of the information it needs. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4488344">Of course, the NDP will be working hard to ensure that this new committee has access to that information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488345">In that regard, Kent Roach and Craig Forcese, legal experts and authors of a book that was recently published on Bill <Document DbId="6842344" Type="3">C-51</Document> and Canada's anti-terrorism laws, have said that without full access to classified information, the committee would not be able to accomplish its task. Mr. Forcese added that this is a good bill, albeit one with inevitable flaws, which likely reflect compromises designed to reconcile elements within the government. Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> is a good start, but even the best review mechanism in the world cannot make up for flawed legislation, such as Bill C-51. It is therefore important not to lose sight of the bigger picture. These are very clear statements from very competent individuals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488346">It seems obvious to me that the new parliamentary oversight committee must act as a sufficient counterbalance to restore Canadians' confidence and, more importantly, prevent the kind of abuse that we have seen or bring it to light.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488347">On that note, in order to demonstrate why we need an oversight committee with adequate powers, I would like to draw the House's attention to fact that the excellent journalists at CBC/Radio-Canada managed to report that, from 2001 to 2004, Canadians were imprisoned and tortured in Syria with the complicity of Canadian authorities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488348">Following the September 11, 2001, attacks in New York, CSIS and the RCMP wanted to find al-Qaeda cells located within the country. In the end, that contributed to massive human rights violations and complicity in the torture of three individuals in Syria. CBC/Radio-Canada had to comb through some 18,000 documents to bring this story to light.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488349">Let us be clear: complicity in torture is unacceptable. It is unacceptable for our authorities to use such an approach. While waiting for a proper parliamentary committee with the right tools to be set up, it is up to talented reporters, like the ones at CBC/Radio-Canada, to ensure that our national security institutions do not engage in this sort of abuse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488350">I think it is high time that we had this tool so that Quebeckers and Canadians can have confidence in the institutions responsible for protecting us.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4488392">Mr. Speaker, today I speak in favour of Bill <Document DbId="8102366" Type="4">C-227</Document>, the community benefits agreement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488393">As the member for Sault Ste. Marie, I campaigned on historic infrastructure investments of $125 billion over 10 years. I strongly believe that if the government wants to, investments will have important impacts on regions and communities, and the bill will have that effect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488394">Bill <Document DbId="8102366" Type="4">C-227</Document> will amend section 20 of the Department of Public Works and Government Services Act to include provisions that will give the minister the flexibility to require bidders on federal projects to include information on the community benefits of said projects for the local community. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488395">For the purposes of the bill, the community benefit agreements are defined as social or economic benefits the community obtains from a public works project. These benefits can include local job creation and training opportunities, improvement of public spaces within the community, and any other specific benefits identified by the community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488396">It is a bill modelled on existing legislation in the province of Ontario, which was implemented earlier this month and is a great fit with this government's priorities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488397">In my riding of Sault Ste. Marie, the steel industry, including companies like Essar Steel Algoma and Tenaris Algoma Tubes are plagued with challenges. Global overcapacity and weak demand have put these domestic steel producers in jeopardy and are threatening the livelihoods of many people and their families. Many have already been laid off. Good-paying jobs in northern Ontario are hard to come by.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488398">As a former city councillor and someone who has worked in economic development in Sault Ste. Marie and northern Ontario for many years, I know that economic development, diversification, and investments in key infrastructure projects are more important today than ever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488399">In fact, Sault Ste. Marie's unemployment rate over the last few years has been in the double digits. Investment in infrastructure in Bill <Document DbId="8102366" Type="4">C-227</Document>, in combination, will work to ensure that the historic investments our government is delivering have direct impacts that will leverage the existing skills and expertise of local businesses and individuals in my riding and in ridings across this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488400">As someone who has worked in training and with the trades, it is my hope that, once passed, this legislation will also lead to more opportunities to train and develop a skilled workforce.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488401">CBAs are a new approach to empowering local communities to partner with developers to respond to local challenges, and through encouraging activities like training, can lead to economic development and growth, poverty reduction, and environmental sustainability in neighbourhoods across Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488402">Canadians, in particular, are struggling economically and need a boost. Our government is working to deliver on a procurement and modernization agenda, and the constituents of my riding, like many others, want the Government of Canada to step up to the plate, after years of neglect, to ensure that Canadians are not left behind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488403">I think of an example in my riding of community benefits that our first nations partners put in place many years ago. We should look to our first nations as leaders in developing community benefits. When we added lanes to Highway 17 that ran through my riding a few years ago, the first nation of Garden River said they would like to see some community benefits, and they listed a number of things, including employment of Garden River people, training, use of local aggregates, and subcontracting with local businesses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488404">I think we could learn a lesson from our first nation friends that this is a good thing. It really helped Garden River. I know that Chief Paul Syrette is a leader in this area and will continue to be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488405">I have been able to speak with the mayor of Sault Ste. Marie, Christian Provenzano, and with many city councillors, and they believe that this is a good thing that will really help our economy, which has been struggling over the last few years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488406">The Government of Canada has an opportunity to work directly with many communities across this area to dictate these community benefits.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4488407">I will use the example of some tradespeople who came to my area to get certification so they could work. They were not from the community. They were not even from northern Ontario, Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, or Alberta. They were from the United States. Sault Ste. Marie is on the border of America, and they had come to work. I have nothing against my American cousins, but when the government spends infrastructure monies, they should direct them to community benefits. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488408">I said that the economy in my riding had been suffering over the last few years and it was an opportunity for other tradespeople from Sault Ste. Marie, northern Ontario, or across the country to work, but they did not. Those are just two anecdotal examples where community benefits in play have helped a community like Garden River and when community benefits were not in play, there was a bit of seepage, so to speak.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488409">Our government has also invested greatly in infrastructure spending in my area, and there are many federal projects that could be invested in and expanded upon. This gives the minister the ability to work with local communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488410">I would be remiss if I did not thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="214067" Type="2">York South—Weston</Affiliation> for introducing this great bill and for his hard work. I know he has gone from coast to coast across the country, talking with many businesses, labour organizations, communities, community leaders, and organizations. I will not steal his thunder, as I know he will speak later, but there were very positive results from those consultations and hard work. My hat goes off to the member for <Affiliation DbId="214067" Type="2">York South—Weston</Affiliation>, who has been working very hard. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488411">This is really important. It is a critical time for us to invest in infrastructure and get the economy going. It is of utmost importance, not just for my generation but our children's generation. My daughter Kate Sheehan is visiting Ottawa today on a professional development day. We have to think about what her future will look like in Sault Ste. Marie and Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488412">I am very pleased that we can dictate the community benefits that will help the riding of Sault Ste. Marie and the surrounding area. The people from Batchewana First Nation are going to have opportunities, as well as Prince Township, Heyden, and Searchmont. There are untold opportunities, and this is just the beginning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488413">We could look at this to see how we could expand it to have more impact. Our historic spending of $125 billion over 10 years is absolutely remarkable. Of course, the spending is important to the steel industry because infrastructure projects use steel. Being the co-chair of the steel caucus, I recognize there are plenty of opportunities for us to have steel in our infrastructure program. I know it will be extremely beneficial for places like Sault Ste. Marie, northern Ontario, Ontario, and the rest of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488414">I cannot stress enough that, after talking with local community leaders, they are totally looking forward to announcements. I am looking forward to making announcements in the future in my riding and working with community leaders to prioritize which infrastructure projects they believe are important. Not only that, but we should engage them again and ask how we can benefit their communities more, get people working, get people into the trades, and get local contractors working on these infrastructure programs.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4488416">Mr. Speaker, I appreciated my colleague's speech on Bill <Document DbId="8102366" Type="4">C-227</Document>, the community benefits bill. Like my colleague, I too was a city councillor, having spent nine years with the City of Barrie before being elected to this wonderful institution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488417">It is my honour to rise on behalf of the residents of Barrie—Innisfil today and speak to Bill <Document DbId="8102366" Type="4">C-227</Document>, a bill brought forward with all the best intentions. In my opinion, and I say this with all due respect to the member for <Affiliation DbId="214067" Type="2">York South—Weston</Affiliation>, it fails in the reality of what he may be trying to propose here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488418">The bill deals with federal infrastructure projects but does not stray far from the process for municipal projects that many here in the House are familiar with. There are 77 members of the House who have municipal political experience; 36 of those members are of the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488419">The planning process goes through many different phases, from determining a need to the drawing up of an idea, the drafting of the building rationale, and the production of the plans. Each of my 76 colleagues who have served locally know that red tape cannot be added to ensure a community benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488420">In the process of a project, there's always the discussion of the benefit that a new project is going to bring to the community, and that really starts at the beginning. If it is a new LRT plan, it is to increase transit ridership, new roads mean goods move faster, waste-water systems mean safer water, and housing funding means affordable housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488421">What does Bill <Document DbId="8102366" Type="4">C-227</Document> mean for federal employees who fall under this? Has their work managing federal infrastructure projects been subpar? Have the women and men of PWGSC been operating under the guise that there's no such thing as a community benefit? There's always a community benefit, and our federal departments are always working with the needs and the benefits of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488422">When the <Affiliation DbId="214314" Type="4">Minister of Infrastructure and Communities</Affiliation> announced funding for municipal projects, he stated on May 5, 2016:</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488424">Does the member for <Affiliation DbId="214067" Type="2">York South—Weston</Affiliation> naturally assume that he does not feel the same for federal employees and our provincial partners? Let us be clear, the bill aims to add red tape and bureaucracy to a process that already has safeguards built into it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488425">The bill intends to add three new reporting mechanisms to every federal infrastructure project. The first stage of the new reporting will come in pre-attribution. This is a repetition of the work being done from the start of an idea: the determining of a need, the benefits of the project, and the benefits of the community the project will serve. Will these proposed projects not come under the watchful eye of the public during consultations? Is this step of a pre-attribution report nothing more than a repeat of the project application process?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488426"> I have been a part of many public consultations in the city of Barrie. The public in these consultations has a keen eye for the community benefit of each and every project. Our residents can see waste a mile away. There is no need for a new step in the beginning to determine if a funding project is a worthwhile endeavour by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488427">The second new mandated report will take place during a project, with ongoing reporting during the works of the project. The most common reasons for increased costs of construction are delays. Delays are deadly to the life cycle of a project. It costs the project manager, construction company, inspectors, and the federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488428">The life cycle of a project has milestones, and these milestones and the timeline in these milestones are watched and mitigated by the project handlers themselves. These milestone reports form much of the reporting after completion. It will be difficult to determine just how community benefits are being met during construction. Time is money. Bill <Document DbId="8102366" Type="4">C-227</Document> will add time and money to the cost of every federal project at a time when many feel we take too long to complete a project today.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4488429">Let me now address the third proposed mandatory reporting requirement after the project is complete. This is perhaps the only real beneficial step in what is being proposed in this bill. We do need to find accountability in the work that is being done and funded by Canadians. Gaps found in a post-evaluation can be addressed for future projects. However, this does not need to be mandated. In the world of project management, a post-completion review is part of a current rigorous process. Why entrench it further when there is no need to?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488430">This bill requires that we add some very important questions addressing red flag concerns. Where will the costs of the extra work be covered? Will it come from within the department's budget? Will the red tape be paid for by project funding received by the very same minister who is asking for the review? Will there be a need to hire to meet the new expanded reporting demands that this bill creates? The current government is starting to sound like the Government of Ontario and becoming a leading new hire employer. The private sector, not the government, should be leading with job creation. Will the government be forced to hire to cover the extra workload? These are all fair questions.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="214064" Type="2">Ms. Brigitte Sansoucy (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4488444"> Mr. Speaker, agreements on community benefits are definitely vectors of social and economic development at the local level. Today, it seems that creating such agreements is a progressive idea and an opportunity that we should seize.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488445">I would like to say that I will be supporting this bill at second reading stage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488446">The NDP believes that we must promote local growth, training and employment by increasing investments in public infrastructure and promoting agreements on community benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488447">This government promised Canadians that there would be change. I am pleased to see today that they are finally getting down to work. The Liberals promised to make massive investments in infrastructure, among other things. We are still waiting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488448">Agreements on community benefits would stimulate growth, employment, and economic and social development not just in my riding, but in all ridings. In Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, there are a number of major infrastructure projects waiting for federal funding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488449">I want to talk about a large-scale infrastructure project, the Casavant Boulevard extension in Saint-Hyacinthe, that I would like to see covered by this kind of agreement. Having served six years as a city councillor, I am sure everyone in Saint-Hyacinthe knows what I am talking about. The project involves building a rail overpass. It is vital to the city's economic development because it will open up the industrial park. Believe it or not, we have been waiting for federal funding for this project for 10 years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488450">The Casavant Boulevard extension is critical to Saint-Hyacinthe's growth and development. The federal government must act quickly and decisively on this file so that we can build this road infrastructure. The Casavant Boulevard extension is well suited to a community benefit agreement. It would be an opportunity to create good jobs, make training available, and revitalize the local economy. It would certainly stimulate growth, help create wealth, and contribute to more responsible development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488451">While I have no doubt this would benefit my riding, I am skeptical about the implementation and the scope of such agreements. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488452">I think that this bill could be improved in several ways. In my riding, it is important to support local businesses. Saint-Hyacinthe is known around the world for being an agrifood technocity. The development of its local businesses would definitely stimulate the economy, create jobs, and promote growth and innovation in my region. That would create a ripple effect. We all know that when our businesses are successful, our economy does well too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488453">What the NDP wants is to include local organizations, regional businesses, and members of the community in the planning process for infrastructure spending. We want to ensure that they enjoy the benefits and spinoffs that this spending creates. That seems like common sense to us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488454">However, this bill does not require bidders to provide all the information about the project to the various stakeholders. In my opinion, that is vital information. This bill also does not specify how the intended benefits will be calculated. It also does not mention the objectives of these agreements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488455">We believe that a targeted recruitment policy must be included in the bill so that members of the community and local organizations and businesses are not forgotten. What is more, as my hon. colleague, the sponsor of this bill mentioned, the purpose of these community benefit agreements is to “create community wealth, quality jobs, training, responsible growth, and a healthier environment”.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4488456">These are honourable goals. However, how can we be sure that they will be implemented if they are not even mentioned in the legislation? I suggest that the legislation include guiding principles that emphasize equity, community involvement, eco-friendly practices, and support for disadvantaged groups.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488457">I would also like to come back to a small, but significant word. I am talking about the word “may” in clause 2 of the bill. This small word makes a big difference. Clause 2 of the bill reads: </ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488459">Why the word “may” and not the word “shall”? In other words, the requirement on community benefits that the project will provide is left to the discretion of the minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488460">There is no guarantee that these agreements to include community benefits will in fact be implemented. I think if we really want to make a difference and generate wealth locally, we should not leave that to the discretion of the minister. If we truly wanted communities to benefit, we would establish clear structures and avoid the kind of ambiguity that we see here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488461">We want the goals of community benefit agreements to be an explicit part of the <Affiliation DbId="214314" Type="4">Minister of Infrastructure and Communities</Affiliation>' mandate. Otherwise, there would be no requirement for the government to report on the success or failure of the policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488462">I am trying to believe in the legislation, and I want it to become a reality for our regions. However, when I consider the conditions of the trans-Pacific partnership, I cannot help but be pessimistic about it. When my honourable colleague introduced the bill in the House, he said, “a similar piece of legislation in Ontario, Bill 6, has survived trade agreements.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488463">Bill <Document DbId="8102366" Type="4">C-227</Document> must do more than survive trade agreements. Chapter 15 of the trans-Pacific partnership does not state whether bid criteria such as those in community benefit agreements would be considered a trade barrier. If that were the case, the bill could expose Canada to trade challenges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488464">The government has bulldozed straight ahead to ratify this trade agreement. It is clear that the government will definitely limit preferences regarding government procurement at an international level. Let us also not forget that a similar piece of legislation in Ontario, Bill 6, has never been in force at the same time as the trans-Pacific partnership. If it survives, I have to wonder what will become of it once that agreement comes into effect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488465">It seems to me that the bill requires a number of changes before this initiative can become a reality, despite its goal to support vulnerable populations while working on development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488466">As I said, we do not want this bill to be a missed opportunity. These kinds of community benefit agreements need to become a reality. It is our duty to provide our regions and our constituents with meaningful social and economic development opportunities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488467">Let us work on creating jobs at a local level. Through these agreements, let us create a generation of qualified workers to build a talent pool for our industries, as recommended by Canada's Building Trades Unions and the National Construction Labour Relations Alliance. Let us stimulate economic growth in our regions. Let us encourage social and economic development in our ridings and our regions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488468">Let us work together to make our regional economies models of development.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4488469">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to rise today to speak to my private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="8102366" Type="4">C-227</Document>, an act to amend the Department of Public Works and Government Services Act, regarding community benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488470">Community benefits are defined as the benefits obtained by a community, above and beyond the infrastructure project itself. These include but are not limited to local job creation, paid training, affordable housing, green space, or any other benefit identified by the community itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488471">My colleagues have brought forward some concerns regarding the bill in today's debate, and previously. I would like to address some of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488472">It is, in fact, a myth that the bill would increase red tape and increase costs for small- and medium-sized businesses. It is not true. In fact, Bill <Document DbId="8102366" Type="4">C-227</Document> would speed up the approval process, thereby, saving money for small and medium-sized businesses. When communities have been consulted on the kinds of benefits that they would like from an infrastructure project and can see those benefits being obtained from an infrastructure project, they are more likely to support the development process and speed up the approval process for new development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488473">It is also a myth that business groups and other organizations oppose Bill <Document DbId="8102366" Type="4">C-227</Document>. In fact, the Toronto board of trade, the Vancouver board of trade, the Montreal board of trade, and many other organizations have come out strongly for community benefit agreements as a good way, as a good economic policy, to tackle youth unemployment and to deal with the issue of including marginalized groups that are not included in the construction industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488474">It is also a complete myth that Bill <Document DbId="8102366" Type="4">C-227</Document> did not receive adequate consultation. The fact is that I have consulted extensively on the bill all across the country. The groups that I have spoken with include, but are not limited to, the United Way, the Toronto Community Benefits Network, the Atkinson Foundation, the Mowat Centre, Canada's Building Trades Union, the Canadian Labour Congress, the Carpenters' Union, the Province of Ontario, the City of Vancouver, and many others. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488475">The Mowat Centre and the Atkinson Foundation have jointly published numerous studies that have stressed the importance of community benefit agreements for local economic growth. I have consulted all levels of government in the provinces across Canada. Having said that, my consultation process is ongoing. I have already planned many meetings across the country to ensure that I continue to consult widely on Bill <Document DbId="8102366" Type="4">C-227</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488476">The bill is modelled on Ontario legislation, Bill C-6. The beauty of that is that we are able to now understand what has worked and what is not working with the Ontario legislation. As such, for example, Bill <Document DbId="8102366" Type="4">C-227</Document> would address the concern about implementation and measurement of outcomes. It would do so in two ways.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488477"> First, the bill would empower the <Affiliation DbId="214324" Type="4">Minister of Public Services and Procurement</Affiliation> to demand from contractors to demonstrate what they think the community benefits would be from an infrastructure project, and to demand an assessment after the completion of the project, to see whether those benefits were indeed delivered. Second, it would also require the minister to report back to Parliament once a year to show how the community benefited from various select building and repair projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488478">Community benefit agreements are also in line with our government's priorities, including procurement modernization and social infrastructure promotion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488479">I am asking my colleagues from all sides of the House to support the bill, Bill <Document DbId="8102366" Type="4">C-227</Document>. Help me to enable communities all across Canada to benefit from building and repair projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488480">I was elected to Parliament to represent <Affiliation DbId="214067" Type="2">York South—Weston</Affiliation>, to push and propose legislation that would benefit my constituents. Bill <Document DbId="8102366" Type="4">C-227</Document> would do exactly that, by dramatically improving the economic local impact that infrastructure has in local communities across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4488481">This would help <Affiliation DbId="214067" Type="2">York South—Weston</Affiliation> and many other communities across this great country.</ParaText>
