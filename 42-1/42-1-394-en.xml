            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5833608">Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege. I have given the necessary one hour notice to the Chair of my intention to rise on such a point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5833609">I rise on a question of privilege today related to the departure from the Liberal caucus of the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214048" Type="2">Whitby</Affiliation>. At its heart, I believe this is a breach of privilege flowing from a violation of section 49.8 of the Parliament of Canada Act. Allow me to explain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5833610">On Wednesday of this week, just before question period, we learned the news of the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214048" Type="2">Whitby</Affiliation> becoming an independent, which happened shortly after the weekly caucus meeting of the Liberal Party had broken up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5833611">Later that afternoon, the CBC aired an interview with the hon. member, conducted by Chris Rands, a producer with that network. She told Mr. Rands:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5833614">Those are words that I have read to the House, but I do urge the Chair to review the footage of that interview. I say this, and I want to tread delicately here, because it was the demeanour of the member that particularly struck me during that interview. The member seemed disappointed, to put it politely.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5833615">What I, and what many who watched that interview, saw was someone who was not just disappointed to part ways with her colleagues, which is understandable, or even a touch of regret with the decision, but that I saw and what I think most people would have seen was a visceral look of shock.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5833616">I do not speak about this to put the member for <Affiliation DbId="214048" Type="2">Whitby</Affiliation> in an awkward place but because I genuinely believe that her so-called resignation is what some might describe as “a negotiated resignation”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5833617">Picture the ultimatum that may have been put to her as I have perceived it, that she had until the end of the day to resign or she would be kicked out, and that it was her decision. That last part sounds familiar.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5833618">My point is that I truly believe the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214048" Type="2">Whitby</Affiliation> was, or was threatened to be, kicked out of the Liberal caucus, that is to say her departure from caucus was not a free and voluntary action on her part.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5833619">That brings me to section 49.2 of the Parliament of Canada Act. This section provides:</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5833631">These provisions were added to the law in 2015 after the Reform Act, 2014 was enacted, a private member's bill sponsored and championed by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="213919" Type="2">Wellington—Halton Hills</Affiliation>. It was a bill that was supported by several members of the Liberal caucus who today sit in the House, including the right honourable member for <Affiliation DbId="214115" Type="2">Papineau</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5833632">It was reported by the Canadian Press on November 5, 2015, that the Liberal caucus failed to conduct the votes required by section 49.8 of the act. Also at the time, the Ottawa Citizen reported that, “rather than vote yes or no to each of the four provisions, Liberal MPs voted during their first caucus meeting on Thursday to send the issue to the party’s biannual convention in Winnipeg next year.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5833633">As for the vote specifically applying to section 49.2 of the act, the <Affiliation DbId="241624" Type="4">intergovernmental affairs minister</Affiliation>, who was then the government House leader, was quoted at the time as saying, “Do you want a discussion in a caucus now of 184 people to reflect on what may be personal, sensitive, family matters? That is something that we weren’t prepared to decide or vote on now.” He went on to say, “I don’t know if in all circumstances it would be appropriate or even desirable…to have a caucus seized of all kinds of this personal and complicated information.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5833634">With all due respect to the member, who is a veteran of this place, that is not what Parliament has, by the act of Parliament, ordered to happen in each parliamentary caucus after each general election. Deferring the mandatory votes to a party convention is also not an available option. Needing to bring party machinery into line is perhaps an argument to vote no to the proposals, but it is not a legitimate reason to avoid voting, which is, to say, to break the law. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5833635">After I had finished my prepared notes for this morning, I came across a Toronto Star article from this morning in which the member for <Affiliation DbId="213903" Type="2">Scarborough—Guildwood</Affiliation> is quoted in reflecting on those votes that did not happen. The article says, “Asked if there had been a recorded vote, [the member for Scarborough—Guildwood] shook his head. 'Nothing like that ever happens in caucus, it's very straightforward, it's consensus. Nobody ever really opposed it.'” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5833636">That is from yesterday's Toronto Star in an article by Tonda MacCharles. Again, it is further confirmation from a sitting member of the Liberal caucus that those four votes did not happen as required by law. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5833637">Further, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="213919" Type="2">Wellington—Halton Hills</Affiliation> has written to the current <Affiliation DbId="245290" Type="96">Minister of Justice and Attorney General</Affiliation> seeking clarity on whether or not the law was applied in that case. He has publicly stated that a letter would be forthcoming, clarifying one way or the other. Again, the House should be seized with the fact that the letter is expected and should have matters of substance in it to the matter at hand. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5833638">Going forward to the questions at hand, because of the events this week, these issues have rushed to the foreground and to the matters before the House. Tonda MacCharles of the Toronto Star wrote that, “Who decides who's in and who's out of Liberal caucus? Is it the prime minister? Is it caucus? You can be forgiven for not knowing.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5833639">The article later reminds us that the Prime Minister “suggested it would be his call, telling reporters he was 'reflecting' on their future”, referring both to the member for Vancouver Granville and Markham—Stouffville. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5833640">As my colleague, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="213919" Type="2">Wellington—Halton Hills</Affiliation>, has pointed out, the authority to expel a member of the Liberal caucus is questionable, because the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his leadership team deprived Liberal MPs of being able to exercise their rights at their first caucus meeting following the 2015 election. It is because of that that I believe the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214048" Type="2">Whitby</Affiliation> has had her own rights disregarded. Her departure from caucus occurred without the safeguards and due process for backbenchers that the Reform Act contemplated. That is why I am raising this question of privilege today, and I believe that it meets the requirements for timeliness. Indeed, this is the first occasion where a consequence of the failure to vote in 2015 has come to a head. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5833641">As for the matter of honouring the statute law, I recognize that Speakers in the past have generally declined to intervene on questions of law. However, this is no regular question of law. The collective privileges of the House of Commons include the right to regulate its internal affairs, which is sometimes also known as the privilege of exclusive cognizance. </ParaText>

                <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, Third Edition, Bosc and Gagnon, observes on page 122 that:</ParaText>

This is equally the case where the House in question is dealing with a matter which is finally decided by its sole authority, such as an order or resolution, or whether (like a bill) it is a joint concern of both Houses. The principle holds good even where the procedure of a House or the rights of its Members or officers who take part in its proceedings depends on statute.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="5833652">Statutory requirements may previously have been adjudicated as matters of privilege in our House in the past. For example, on April 19, 1993, on page 18,105 of the Debates, the Chair held that the failure to produce a document required to be laid upon the table under the terms of the Customs Tariff constituted a prima facie case of privilege. Mr. Speaker Fraser, at the time, said the following:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5833657">More recently, statutory provisions in the Canada Elections Act concerning the right of members to sit and vote were held by the Speaker's immediate predecessor to be matters for the House of Commons to adjudicate. These rulings can be found at pages 18,550 of the Debates for June 18, 2013, and page 9,183 of the Debates for November 4, 2014.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5833658">The importance of this House adjudicating requirements of section 49.8 of the Parliament of Canada Act are underscored by section 49.7, a provision which lawyers would refer to as a privative clause because it ousts the jurisdiction of the courts to conduct judicial review.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5833659">If you, Mr. Speaker, decline to exercise jurisdiction to entertain breaches of the statute here, then members of caucuses, like the Liberal caucus who flagrantly ignore the law, have no protection and no recourse when their rights are trampled. Because of the lack of judicial recourse, general restraint on Speakers interpreting the law and the House's privilege to manage internal affairs, I respectfully submit that the way forward, indeed the only way forward, is to allow the House to deal with this matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5833660">Accordingly, I urge you to find a prima facie case of privilege. I would, therefore, be prepared to move a motion to refer the matter to the procedure and House affairs committee so as to allow it to investigate this specific instance and to consider the best way forward to allow for the enforcement of the requirement to conduct votes under section 49.8 of the Parliament of Canada Act.</ParaText>

It is a recorded vote, much the same as we take recorded divisions in this House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5833675">Finally, the point I want to make is that the patriation reference of 1981 made it clear that constitutional conventions could not be adjudicated by the courts, could not be taken to the courts to defend rights of members of Parliament.

I will quote from a transcript of her presentation, which states, “What CBC News can confirm through multiple sources is that when Ontario Liberal MPs met for their weekly meeting this morning, [the hon. member for Markham—Stouffville], who was there, was really the focus of attention at the meeting, and she faced a series of difficult questions about her actions. She, of course, very publicly quit and criticized the Prime Minister, but did not leave caucus when she decided to quit. What we are also told is that while these questions were being asked, the member was also reminded by some of her colleagues of some of the sacrifices and compromises they made to help her with some of her projects like getting the assisted dying legislation passed.... So the meeting went 30 minutes longer than it normally would go. It is described by sources as 'rough' and 'uncomfortable' and rocky', but we do know that Liberals that we were speaking with today, while these concerns may exist privately, this is a group of Liberal Ontario MPs that held this meeting.”</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5833793">Mr. Speaker, I would ask for your indulgence for more time than that. I do think questions of parliamentary privilege filed under Standing Order 48(2) would trump members' statements. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5833794">Parliamentary privilege, as you know, Mr. Speaker, is both individual and collective. My parliamentary privilege as a member of Parliament and as the shadow minister for foreign affairs has been breached, as has the collective parliamentary privilege of every member of the House of Commons to deliberate, debate and legislate in accordance with their parliamentary function, in accordance with what their constituents sent them to Ottawa to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5833795">These have been tiring days. There is lots of stress on both sides, but I would implore the Liberal members to remember that they are sent as individual members to Parliament to represent their constituents, not to represent the Prime Minister's Office. My privilege and the collective privilege of this chamber have been impeded in debate, in committee inquiry, in question period responses and in voting, so it is an extensive breach of parliamentary privilege.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5833796">I would remind the Chair and the House that this privilege is absolute, going back to 1689 and to our Constitution Act of 1867. In fact, solicitor-client privilege, which has been the subject of discussion in recent weeks in relation to the member for <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">Vancouver Granville</Affiliation>, is superseded by parliamentary privilege. That has been considered and is a precedent of that Chair. In fact, the April 27, 2010, a decision by Speaker Milliken said:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5833797">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">It is the view of the Chair that accepting an unconditional authority of the executive to censor the information provided to Parliament would in fact jeopardize the very separation of powers that is purported to lie at the heart of our parliamentary system and the independence of its constituent parts. </QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5833798">That was Speaker Milliken saying that national security, confidentiality at the highest levels, cannot stand in the way of any member of Parliament in this chamber exercising his or her privilege as a member. That was recently reaffirmed in Westminster with the decision in the matter of Lord Hain in 2018, in which public interest and parliamentary privilege superseded court injunctions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5833799">Therefore, it is fundamental that solicitor-client privilege is secondary to parliamentary privilege, and I would note that Justice Lamer, as he then was, in the Descôteaux decision of the Supreme Court of Canada, confirmed this. There is the legal ability under law to insert itself into the solicitor-client confidentiality relationship. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5833800">That is important to understand, because certainly the member for <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">Vancouver Granville</Affiliation>, as a lawyer, takes that responsibility seriously. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5833801">What we can take from the decision of Justice Lamer is that the law gives authority to intercede into solicitor-client privilege and that it should be done narrowly. In his words, it should be done “only if doing so is absolutely necessary to achieve the ends sought by the enabling legislation.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5833802">In this case, the enabling legislation is our Constitution. My parliamentary privilege and our collective parliamentary privilege is impeded by the executive's, the Prime Minister's Office's, persistence in limiting the waiver of privilege. The member for <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">Vancouver Granville</Affiliation> wants to speak further. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is not allowing her, but this Parliament can allow her. I would remind members that I have seen some of her own colleagues criticizing her.</ParaText>

Even if we believe that jobs trump the rule of law, there is still a problem with this story: It is false. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5834116">That claim, of course, makes no sense on the face of it. Moving its headquarters would be impossible for the company, and I will get to why in a moment, but would not actually reduce the company's criminal culpability. Even if the headquarters were in Beijing, London or Kalamazoo, criminal charges would proceed here in Canada; thus, leaving the country would make no sense as a strategy to avoid legal penalty. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5834117">Furthermore, it is impossible for SNC to move its headquarters. It must stay in Montreal as part of a $1.5-billion loan deal that the company signed with the Quebec pension plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5834118">To quote a March 20 SNC report written to its shareholders, SNC-Lavalin “...has undertaken that, for the period of seven (7) years, the head office of SNC-Lavalin will remain in Montreal and will remain the focus of the Company's strategic decision-making; a significant portion of the Company's management team, including its CEO, will be resident in the Province of Quebec....” That is the agreement that the company signed to retain this $1.5-billion loan from the Quebec pension plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5834119">Furthermore, the company just signed a 20-year lease and is undertaking a major workplace renovation for its 2,000 employees. Companies do not renovate their office space for 2,000 employees if they are moving. Even after the director of public prosecutions and the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> decided not to grant the company a remediation agreement and even after the CEO learned that the charges would go ahead, the CEO, Neil Bruce, told the Toronto Star that SNC is not moving.

              <ParaText id="5834127">Mr. Speaker, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said twice on September 17 to the <Affiliation DbId="214323" Type="21">former attorney general</Affiliation> that either she should shelve the charges against SNC-Lavalin or its headquarters would leave Montreal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5834128">This week, Business News Network asked the CEO of SNC-Lavalin, “Did you threaten to move your headquarters from Montreal?" CEO Neil Bruce replied, “No.” He was asked, “Never?” and again he replied, “No.” The interviewer then asked, “Where did this issue come up that it was a possibility for SNC?” The CEO replied, “I don't know what people make up, or what they have in their minds.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5834129">When he said people, he was referencing the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. It was the Prime Minister who said twice on September 17 to the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> and then once a few weeks ago at a press conference that SNC would move out of Canada altogether if the criminal charges went ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5834130">Now that we know the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister's</Affiliation> claim to the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> was false, this raises a number of important questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5834131">Section 139 of the Criminal Code makes it an offence for anyone to attempt to obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice. The course of justice at the time the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> met with the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> was for SNC-Lavalin's fraud and bribery charges to go to trial. That is where the course of justice was leading. He was attempting to interrupt that course of justice by persuading his attorney general to sign a deal with the company, or have the prosecutor do so, that would shelve those charges. If he deliberately stated a falsehood to the top law officer to have charges shelved, his own criminal culpability may be at stake, and we will examine that issue more as the days go on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5834132">That is the issue of the headquarters, but the other half of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister's</Affiliation> jobs claim is that, according to him and to testimony by his top adviser, Gerald Butts, “9,000 people's jobs are at stake”. I am quoting Mr. Butts in his testimony.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5834133">Earlier this week a reporter for BNN asked the CEO of SNC-Lavalin about the claim. She said, “The inference is that if you do not get to go the way of deferred prosecution agreement, 9,000 jobs disappear.” The CEO answered, “That's incorrect, and we've never said that.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5834134">The CEO was asked directly about the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister's</Affiliation> claim that 9,000 jobs would vanish if the charges proceeded, and he replied, “That's incorrect, and we've never said that.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5834135">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> suggested he got that information from the company. Who else would have told him that 9,000 jobs would up and vanish if charges were to go ahead? Now we know that his 9,000 jobs claim was a falsehood; we know that he looked Canadians in the eye and told them something that was not true. Not only do we have the mendacity around the Prime Minister's defence, but we also have a broader and bigger question that has not been answered or even explored.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5834136">If the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was not protecting jobs when he tried to shelve the fraud and bribery charges for SNC-Lavalin, then who was he protecting? What motivated him to personally interfere with the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> and to direct his staff and ministers to contact her 20 times in order to shelve these charges? That is an extraordinary amount of activity for a prime minister and his team under any circumstances. In the interest of dropping charges on a corporation accused of a serious crime, it is spectacular in its weirdness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5834137">In all my years I have never heard of a prime minister or any politician trying to interfere to have charges dropped. However, to personally interact with an attorney general in order to do so is maybe a once in history event in Canada, and that is the source of this massive scandal.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5834144">Mr. Speaker, the answer is no. I am referring to an interview the SNC-Lavalin CEO did. In the interview, he does not say that job losses will result. What he actually said was that in the absolute worst-case scenario, Canadian workers at SNC-Lavalin may ultimately just get jobs with other Canadian construction companies in Canada and that those jobs would be in Canada, because the construction projects are in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5834145">Let me explain something to the member about infrastructure. When they are doing infrastructure jobs, their workers have to be there. SNC is building the north-south transit project in Ottawa. They cannot build a 14-kilometre transit line in Beijing or London and drop it out of a helicopter in the nation's capital. The work would actually have to be done here. Not only is it wrong to claim that there would be job losses in the event of prosecution, it is physically impossible.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5834147">I just wonder why the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is going through hell and high water to protect a company that has clearly gone to such great lengths to bribe a company to get contracts, when he should be perhaps focusing on things like the energy sector or maybe the agriculture sector, where we have a catastrophic failure today on behalf of the government, and, relating it to the motion at hand, why travel and Canadian voices are so important, especially given the culture of silence this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the current government have undertaken this week.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5834149">The Liberal member across the way continues to revive from the dead this 9,000-jobs claim. The CEO of the company has correctly pointed out that 9,000 jobs are not at stake. He said that in the worst-case scenario, a criminal conviction might cause some of those employees to work for other Canadian companies in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5834150">I will tell members why they would have to work in Canada. SNC-Lavalin has the five biggest construction jobs in all of the country right now. They are worth $52 billion. Because they are construction jobs, they have to be done on construction sites. In other words, the employees working on those jobs would have to do them in Canada. Unless the Liberal government is going to allow foreign workers to come into Canada and displace those construction jobs in our country, it would be impossible for those jobs to be lost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5834151"> In other words, the whole jobs excuse has been a patent lie, which raises two questions. One, is it appropriate to have a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who looked 37 million Canadians in the eyes at a press conference a couple of weeks ago and stated a patent falsehood that is disprovable with a brief look at the facts and a brief listening to the company's CEO? Two, given that we now know that he was not protecting jobs, who was he protecting, and why?</ParaText>

We are already seeing the consequences of that. Late last night, as we were going through our 30th hour of debate, it broke that China has now refused to purchase any canola from Canadian producers. Initially it was from just one supplier, Richardson, but that has now been expanded to include canola from every Canadian producer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5834176">It ties it back to Bill <Document DbId="10085047" Type="3">S-6</Document> and the importance of having representation from the House of Commons and from parliamentarians reaching out to some of our trading partners around the world and some of our allies around the world, including Madagascar. Had we had that relationship with China, we may have been able to address this crisis before it started.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5834177">Not only was the announcement late last night about canola very disconcerting to the 45,000 canola producers across Canada, but this morning we also heard that it has been expanded to include peas, wheat and possibly other Canadian commodities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5834178">I want to expand on the consequences of not having representation from Canada and Canadian parliamentarians with our trusted trading partners. Let us go back in time a little, when one of our number one importers of Canadian lentils and peas was India. Under our government, we expanded that market to more than $5 billion in Canadian lentils and peas being exported to India.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5834179">After our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s ill-fated trip to India, India has refused to give us an exemption to their fumigation rules. It has also put extremely high tariffs, up to 50%, on some of our lentils and peas. As a result, our exports of these products to India have gone from $5 billion, a high under a previous Conservative government, to as low as $500 million now. That is a massive market for our pea and lentil producers we have lost because of the inept foreign affairs positions and strategies of the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5834180">Sometimes good can come out of bad. Because we lost that significant market in India, many of our producers were able to look to other markets. They had to. We cannot sell that much of that product here in Canada. Ninety per cent of the agricultural products we produce here in his country are exported.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5834181">Our producers were able to find other markets, including China. With this morning's announcement, we have now lost that secondary market. Within one calendar year, our pea and lentil producers have lost their first and now their second major markets in the world. A big part of that is because of the failures of the Liberal government when it comes to our foreign relations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5834182"> That goes directly back to Bill <Document DbId="10085047" Type="3">S-6</Document> and why I think it is so important for the Standing Committee on Finance to have the opportunity to travel as part of this study to rebuild some of those foreign relations we had with some of our trading partners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5834183">I talked about canola at the beginning of my intervention. I want to stress the fact that it is clear that the Liberal government does not understand the urgency of this decision by the Chinese government to block Canadian canola imports. This is a $26-billion market with economic impacts on Canada's economy. There are 250,000 jobs. These are decisions that are going to impact our producers, not in the fall, when they harvest next year's canola crop, but now. This is impacting the decisions they make right now.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5834184">The cost of a bushel of Canadian canola has gone down by more than a dollar a bushel. The value of the canola that farmers have in their bins from last year's harvest has reduced by more than half a billion dollars and is probably getting close to a billion.

There are in fact several errors in the French version. It is rather difficult to follow. I would ask that you come up with a solution, since there are several errors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5834187">For instance, the English version refers to the Standing Committee on Finance, which is correct, while the French version talks about the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities.

This is coming from a member who represents a party which is constantly blocking travel by the finance committee, and this motion, being written in haste, is all about trying to delay the debate on the budget, which was tabled this week, so that Canadians cannot hear about all the good things that are in that budget for Canadians.</ParaText>
