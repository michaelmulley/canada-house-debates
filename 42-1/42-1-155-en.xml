              <ParaText id="4809882">Mr. Speaker, Canada's number one magazine, <I>Maclean's</I>, has just published more of the anti-Quebec drivel that we have come to expect from it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4809883"> According to <I>Maclean's</I>, Quebec is a pathologically alienated and deficient society compared to the rest of Canada. Basically, it lacks social solidarity. We are becoming accustomed to being scorned by Canada, and increasingly outraged. Quebec-bashing has become socially acceptable in Canada. No other community could ever be humiliated this way without the House of Commons reacting with shock and outrage. If the author had written that Catholics, the Greek community, or homosexuals, for example, are pathologically alienated, the House would have rightly reacted vigorously and unanimously in the face of such an abuse. However, when Quebec is the victim, it does not matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4809884">Yesterday the member for <Affiliation DbId="214282" Type="2">La Pointe-de-l'Île</Affiliation> moved a motion to condemn <I>Maclean's</I>, but the House rejected it. That move speaks volumes about the respect that federal parliamentarians have for Quebec.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4809900">In the same vein, education is of the utmost importance to the Union. In Montreal, the AGBU supports Alex Manoogian School. In addition to passing on the Armenian culture, this school also responds to crises. For example, Alex Manoogian School warmly welcomes refugees who need to learn French.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4809903">I rise today, though, to honour the life and community contributions of Isabella Ferrara, of Vaughan, who suddenly passed away on February 13. Isabella was a social activist and strong advocate for seniors' causes. She believed that an active social life could help provide important supports for many seniors. Her work, both as president of the Pine York Seniors' Club and as founder of SAVI, the Seniors Association of Vaughan Initiative, was instrumental in forging a vibrant, tightly knit, and healthy seniors community in Vaughan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4809904"> In recognition of her significant contribution, Isabella received awards across all levels of government: the Order of Vaughan, the Ontario Senior Achievement Award, and the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee medal. </ParaText>

I heard the <Affiliation DbId="224669" Type="4">Leader of the Government in the House of Commons</Affiliation> say that she wanted to hold a discussion and have all parliamentarians take part in it. I would humbly submit to the House that we have had to witness this exchange even though we cannot sit on the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs or any other committee. Indeed, since October 19, 2015, we have been banned from this type of debate and thus ostracized as parliamentarians.</ParaText>

It is an affront to hear people who have millions of dollars, and so much the better for them, to spend on being heard and having their constituents' voices heard.

              <ParaText id="4810166"> Many of us in the House will remember the flood of June 2013, which devastated many communities in my riding, including High River. However, what made that flood more damaging to the community was the actions of the RCMP after the flood, where it allegedly illegally entered more than 4,600 homes in the community. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810167">The petitioners ask the government to look into and determine if any of these were unwarranted entries that violated the privacy rights and property rights of High River residents; determine if these entries were contrary to any provisions of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms; and debate and vote on a motion calling on the government to rebuild trust within the RCMP among High River residents by holding an independent judicial inquiry into the legal justification from the RCMP entering 4,600 homes in High River. </ParaText>

That is less than the price of a chocolate bar. From this, it is making huge profits from our water.</ParaText>

They ask that our House consider stopping Nestlé and other big companies and conserve our water for future generations to come. They also want us to encourage the public to start using reusable bottle and stop buying plastic bottles.</ParaText>

There are historical and procedural reasons why all members of Parliament are given equal access to this sensitive information, but there is also a very important economic reason, and that is, any individual having advance access to this sensitive information could potentially profit from it. We do recall that roughly a decade ago, an RCMP investigation was launched into a previous budget measure because certain individuals were given an advance view of a decision with respect to income trusts. That RCMP investigation led to charges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810218">We have no evidence at this point that anything of that nature has occurred here. However, Mr. Speaker, I would ask you to broaden the investigation that the hon. member has asked you to carry out to ensure that none of the sensitive information contained in the budget was shared by members of the government who had advance access to it, prior to its public and parliamentary release. </ParaText>

The details of the measures are contained in these documents, and I am asking that an order of the day be designated for consideration of these motions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4810250">As Canadians come together to celebrate Canada 150, we proudly reflect on the generations that came before us, generations that built a country on the belief that with hope and hard work they could deliver a better future for themselves and for their children, and for their grandchildren. That optimism and that confidence helped define us as a country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810251">Sharing those beliefs with others made Canada a beacon of diversity, openness, and generosity around the world, yet over the last few decades, the middle class and those working hard to join it have fallen behind. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810252">Everyday folks who work hard to provide for their families are worried about the future. They are worried that rapid technological change, the seemingly never-ending need for new skills, and growing demands on our time mean that their kids will not have the same opportunities they had, and who can blame them? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810253">For a decade, middle-class struggles were simply swept under the rug. People were left without a clear vision at a time of unprecedented change. However, the good news is that Canadians, on their own accord, worked hard and persevered. We have always been resilient, innovative, able to adapt and prosper in the face of change.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="4810254"> Knowing that, we put together a plan to ensure that, in a changing world, Canada's middle class and those working hard to join it can—and will—succeed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810255">A year and a half ago, our government set out to deliver the kind of change that would make a real difference for Canadians. We said we would help people retire with dignity. We said we would ask the wealthiest 1% to pay a little more, so we could cut taxes for the middle class. We said we would make smart, responsible investments in our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810256">That is exactly what we did. We have delivered on behalf of Canadians, and we are just getting started.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4810258">One of the most memorable moments I have had as Canada's finance minister actually happened in a taxi cab in Toronto. On the way home one night, my taxi cab driver, Mian, recognized me and we started chatting. Then he did something that surprised me. He called his wife and put her on the speakerphone. They wanted to talk to me about the difference that the Canada child benefit had made in their lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810259">You will remember, Mr. Speaker, that this benefit gives nine out of 10 Canadian families with kids more help with the high cost of managing their family. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810260">In Mian's case, with three children aged 11, 9, and 10 months, the Canada child benefit means that he and his wife receive about $300 more each month than they did a year ago. That is an extra $3,600 tax-free every year, money that can be put toward groceries, school supplies, and new clothes for going back to school.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810261">There are countless other stories just like this one across the country, each a sign that confidence is building and our plan for middle-class prosperity is working. </ParaText>

They want a government focused on creating good jobs today, while also preparing Canadians for the jobs of tomorrow. They want a government that puts our skilled, talented, and creative people at the heart of a more innovative and globally competitive Canada.</ParaText>

We have lifted 18 long-term boil water advisories in first nations communities. Our work continues, because we will not stop until every child in Canada has access to clean drinking water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810272"> Ten years from now, our cities, towns, and northern and rural communities will be healthier and better connected. Our air and water will be cleaner. More Canadian goods will get to international markets, and modern, efficient public transit systems will get hard-working parents home more quickly at the end of a long day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810273">As we look to the coming decades, we also see the potential of new innovations to transform our lives. Self-driving cars, artificial intelligence, genomics, quantum computing, mobile payments, the sharing economy, these ideas are changing our world for the better, just like the innovations that preceded them.</ParaText>

Therefore, as we create the jobs of tomorrow, we will support a culture of life-long learning to help workers and their families adapt to the changing demands of our time. We will help students get the skills and work experience they need to kick-start their careers. We will make it more affordable for thousands of parents of young children to learn new skills while raising their families. We will give people who have lost their jobs the chance to go back to school for further training, helping these Canadians to advance their careers, and turn challenges into opportunity. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4810284">In agrifood, too, we are positioned for success. By 2050, global demand for food is expected to rise by 70%. That means more demand for prairie canola, Atlantic crab and lobster, and B.C. berries. It also means more jobs in the fields of southwestern Ontario and on the maple syrup farms of Quebec’s Eastern Townships. We will help farmers, producers, and processors build their businesses globally, and do so sustainably. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810285">Canadians know that our environment and our economy go hand in hand. It is why we have worked with the provinces and territories to adopt the pan-Canadian framework on clean growth and climate change. This not only means cleaner air to breathe; it means business and investment opportunities. That means jobs installing solar cells, manufacturing electric cars, or developing cleaner fuels will be in high demand. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810286">Luckily, our energy sector is already well positioned to not only compete but to lead.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4810288">Our plan is clear. Smart, ambitious investments in people, communities, and high-growth industries lead to opportunity, opportunity lead to jobs, jobs lead to a more confident and growing middle class, and a more confident, growing middle class is the only path to strong and sustained economic growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810289"> The government’s role in all of this is to lend support to those who are driving us forward and to make sure that everyone has a real and fair chance at success.

              <ParaText id="4810291">We believe that whether their ailments are physical or mental, Canadians deserve the best possible care that we can provide. They deserve our help.

              <ParaText id="4810292"> Through these landmark agreements and historic health transfers to provinces and territories, representing over $200 billion over the next five years, we will reduce stress for families.

              <ParaText id="4810293">Having had the honour of representing and meeting families in St. James Town and Regent Park in Toronto, I have seen first-hand the challenge of affordable housing.

              <ParaText id="4810294">Our government has shown, and will continue to show, national leadership on housing.

              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="4810296">In order to make laws and develop policies and programs that are in the best interests of all Canadians, we have to know what kind of impact they will have.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="4810297">We know, for example, that while Canadian companies are getting better when it comes to hiring more women, they are still less effective at promoting women to senior roles, and we know that fewer women join or stay in the workforce than men. That means that as a country, we are not taking full advantage of the talents, insights, and experience of more than half of our population. It makes no sense. We need to do better. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810298">Therefore, as a first step, we have asked the Canada-United States Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders to quickly advise us on how we can better empower women entrepreneurs and remove barriers for women in business. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810299">However, not all obstacles to progress are as obvious, so in budget 2017, we did something that should have been done a long time ago: we published the government’s first-ever gender statement. This is an assessment that ensures all budget measures, not just those aimed specifically at women, help us advance the goals of fairness, gender equality, and stronger workforce participation. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="4810300">We realize that this is just the start, and we look forward to feedback on this first effort, which we will then build into future budgets. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4810301">Another challenge we must confront is access to quality child care. Too often we hear stories of single parents living in poverty because the cost of child care is so high they cannot afford to go back to work. That is not acceptable in our country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810302">To help low- and middle-income families with the costs of child care, we are committing $7 billion over the next decade to increase the number of high-quality child care spaces available across our country. In order to provide immediate relief, this will be working together with provinces and territories. We know that doing this could create up to 40,000 new subsidized child care spaces over the next three years. Canadian parents deserve our support, and we are delivering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810303">We know that strong partnerships between the federal government and indigenous communities are crucial for our success. Over the next five years, funding for indigenous peoples will have increased by over 27% from what it was when our government took office, well in excess of what would have been provided under the decades-old 2% funding cap. It will contribute to a higher quality of life on reserves, while setting Canada on a path toward true reconciliation with indigenous peoples. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810304">This work continues today, both because it is a recognition of the rights of indigenous peoples and because it is essential to our economic future. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="4810305">Together, we will build stronger, more resilient communities and renew our nation-to-nation relationship with First Nations, Inuit, and Métis.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4810306">We will help break down employment barriers, with a focus on skills development, training, and better education. We will provide greater access to mental health, wellness, and suicide prevention services, while working with indigenous communities to combat substance abuse. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810307">This is our plan for Canada. For it to succeed, we all have to do our share. I have been very fortunate in my life to have had a successful career in business and I have always paid my fair share of taxes, but it can be tempting for some to be too aggressive in their tax planning. Our review of federal tax expenditures, for example, highlighted a number of issues around tax planning strategies using private corporations. These are strategies that can result in some very wealthy individuals getting tax breaks at the expense of others. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="4810308"> Canadians expect a fair tax system. Our government is committed to taking action on this issue, and we will have more to say on this in the near future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810309"> One of our government's very first actions was to raise taxes for the wealthiest Canadians, so that we could cut taxes for the middle class. Because of this tax cut, nine million Canadians see more money on their paycheques. These measures are making a real difference in people's lives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810310">We also gave the Canada Revenue Agency more resources to detect, audit, and combat tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4810311">Going forward, we will close loopholes that result in unfair tax advantages for some at the expense of others. We will eliminate inefficient tax measures, especially those that disproportionately benefit the wealthy. We will work with the provinces and the territories to crack down on those who hide their identity to avoid paying taxes. Let me be clear. All Canadians must pay their fair share of taxes, period. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4810312">Canada has always played an important role on the international stage. Going forward, as needs change, so too will our approach. In international assistance, for example, we remain committed to helping the world's poorest and most vulnerable, and we will continue to modernize our efforts so we can deliver better results, improve transparency, and foster innovation around the world.</ParaText>

Nowhere is this truer than with our neighbours to the south.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810315"> Canada and the United States have the most successful economic relationship in the world, supporting millions of middle-class jobs on both sides of the border. We are proud of this fact. We are also proud to have recently concluded CETA, free trade agreement that will create jobs, reduce red tape, and give Canadian businesses preferred access to half a billion potential customers across the European Union. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810316">As we prepare for the global economy of tomorrow, we will put our best foot forward, always looking to develop strategic partnerships to attract talent and investment, partnerships that will help our companies succeed, create good middle-class jobs at home, and do well globally.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4810326">Without a shadow of a doubt, we have come to understand one thing today: the Liberal government has completely lost control of public finances. I would remind members that barely two years ago, those people were elected by promising a small $10 billion deficit and a balanced budget in 2019. In 2019, Canadians will have a deficit of $27.9 billion. That is completely unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810327">This government has no regard for Canadians because it has completely lost control of government spending. Over the next six years, this government is going to run up a deficit of $113 billion. Barely six months ago, it gave us an economic update and today we see that it was off by $13 billion. Those people do not know how to count.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810328">Even worse, as of midnight, Canadians are going to pay new taxes on tobacco, on alcohol, and, soon, on Uber. This government is making up taxes. On top of that, even though this government constantly lectures everyone about the environment, it is going to abolish the tax credit for people who use public transit. </ParaText>

One and a half years ago, we began by implementing measures that have substantially improved the confidence of the middle class.

              <ParaText id="4810333">What the people on the other side of the House do not seem to understand is what happened over the 10 years before we came into office.

We have set about to increase confidence and to grow our economy so our children and our grandchildren will be better off.</ParaText>

They have been told that they are going to have to wait a little longer. Basically, they will have to wait until the next federal election, which is when the floodgates will open and investment dollars will flow into our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810336">The Liberal Party has often told the House that it would close the gap between indigenous children and non-indigenous children, which is what the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal called for. However, there is nothing in this budget about keeping that promise. Instead, the government has kept a tax loophole open so that CEOs and the wealthiest members of society can get tax breaks for stock options. The government is giving the richest 1% a tax break that is worth six times more, but it is turning its back on indigenous children and the Canadian federation. </ParaText>

Unfortunately, the government before us, which racked up over $100 billion in debt, left us with a low growth rate, so making investments is critically important for us to make a difference in the future. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810353">That is what we are doing. We are making those investments so we will all be better off in the future, so we will have a growth rate that will make it clear that Canada continues to be a country that can lead the world.
