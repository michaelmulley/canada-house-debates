They are creative people. They write songs, build airplanes, and jazz up shepherd's pie. They stand by each other. They built themselves a society that gives anyone who wants to work hard a chance. When they decide to do something, they give it their all, knowing that they have just one life to live. That is what we will be celebrating this weekend.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5507686">I hope everyone will have a chance to celebrate with good people, I hope the weather will co-operate, and I hope everyone has a great time. Happy national holiday to all Quebeckers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5507688">Three Montérégie farmers, Paul Boudrias, Honoré Daigneault, and Moïse Riendeau, led the initiative to create the market in 1968, supported by the Société de l'agriculture de La Prairie. Three generations of vegetable producers have followed, which shows the market's popularity. There are 96 stalls accommodating about 30 merchants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5507689">The Marché des jardiniers is a very special place in my community. It is where customers can meet their farmers, where they can see for themselves the quality, freshness, and variety of products on offer, while speaking directly with the people who work so tirelessly to produce them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5507690">To highlight the importance of those relationships, I wish to salute all producers and the Quebec Produce Growers Association. These are the people who feed our families, and they are the driving force behind our vibrant local agricultural sector.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5507692">First elected to the town council in 1980, Ed then served as mayor from 1994. Altogether, that is 38 years of continuous public service. During his tenure, the community built a new water plant, a new fire hall, a new library, a new theatre, a new recycling building, and much more. When the community was in need, Ed rolled up his sleeves and attracted a physician and two new veterinarians to town. With Ed at the helm, Boissevain is now known for its beauty, winning multiple Communities in Bloom awards, including at the international level.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5507693">I want to thank Ed for his incredible commitment to the people of Boissevain. The town is certainly better off than it was 38 years ago, and that is a tribute to his leadership. I wish him all the best in his retirement and want to thank his wife Lynn and daughters Erin and Darcy for lending their father during his time of public service.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5507695">Thanks to the Canada summer jobs program, 526 students from across Avalon will have meaningful and exciting work this summer. This totals over $1.2 million in investments in the youth of my riding, who will work as camp counsellors and soccer coaches and at festivals and seasonal shops, where they will all learn, grow, and have fun. This is an important investment, and I am proud of our government's commitment to keep investing in our youth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5507696">On that note, I would like to wish all students and teachers in Avalon a safe and happy summer holiday. I ask everyone to be extra cautious as they drive around at this time of year and to have an eye out for kids as they are busy playing and enjoying their time off.</ParaText>

Without the work of volunteers like them, June 21 would not be what it is today. I wish everyone in Canada could see their efforts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5507700">I invite everyone from across Canada to contact their local first nation, Métis, or Inuit communities to see what events they are hosting this year. I invite everyone to experience our unique cultures, to share photos, to learn our shared history, to maybe learn a phrase or two in the local language, and to celebrate everything there is about indigenous people in Canada.

It is very important that we give them not only a healthy and safe environment to grow up in, but also the tools to help them be successful in our society. Over the years, Cape Breton has seen challenging economic times, which has created one of the highest child poverty rates in the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5507715">With the various programs and investments by our government, we are turning the Cape Breton economy around. With the Canada child benefit, payments in my riding alone average $720 per family each month. This is helping 12,000 children. What I am hearing from parents at home is that this money not only helps with necessities, but it also helps to put kids in after-school activities such as soccer, hockey, and dance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5507716"> Our government has additionally invested $35 million in early learning and child care in our province over the next three years. Are we there yet? No. That is why I am looking forward to our government's poverty reduction strategy, which will be released in the upcoming weeks. I commend all who had input into this strategy, and I hope all members will support it when it comes before the House.</ParaText>

Mr. Benjamin Kelly, of Caledonia Regional High School in Hillsborough, received the 2018 Prime Minister's Award for Teaching Excellence in STEM. Mr. Kelly is an inspirational teacher who understands that our lives as Canadians are becoming more digital every single day, and that it is essential for future generations to take advantage of the unparalleled global opportunities provided by STEM education. </ParaText>

Our world has become an unwelcome place for refugees. As people flee to safety, to borders or to shores, they are routinely barred from entry. Refugee families and children are split up and incarcerated. Women and children face sexual and gender-based violence at alarming rates. LGBTQ2 refugees face increased persecution. Refugees live in deplorable conditions, with limited food, medicine, and water. Being a refugee is not a crime, and being born a refugee should not be a life sentence. </ParaText>

My province of Manitoba has seen first-hand the devastating effects flooding can have on our communities.

Alongside the province, our investment will allow for the management of the flows of these watersheds and protect the communities of the region for years to come.</ParaText>
