              <ParaText id="5712182">Since 1975, every modern land claims agreement in Canada has involved the province or territory where the lands in question are located. Further, every modern land claims agreement in Canada's northern territories has involved three parties: the indigenous group, Canada and the government of the territory where the agreement is to operate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712183"> The two Dene treaties affect jurisdictional authority and will result in financial obligations to the Government of Nunavut and will also require amendments to the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement. They cannot be implemented without the consent of the Government of Nunavut.</ParaText>

I am extremely proud to say that they have found a new home and are back to serving the community. I stopped by last week to donate some supplies and had the opportunity to speak with their general manager, Rita. She tells me that they are thrilled with the new space and are excited to be back working with their patrons.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5712197">Mr. Speaker, Canada is losing more and more good-paying jobs. This past week was particularly bad in terms of job losses. In our region, it was the announcement by HudBay that it is closing the Flin Flon mining operation by 2021. This follows the closure of the smelter and the refinery in Thompson earlier this year. Nationally, we have seen the closure of the Oshawa GM plant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712198">We are seeing the hollowing out of the Canadian economy in key sectors, like manufacturing and the resource sector. While our communities have been working hard to diversify and find other job opportunities, there can be no doubt that the loss of these good-paying jobs is devastating.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712199">Governments need to be there for us in tough times. They need to be there for Canadians, and the federal government has been largely absent. Despite the fact that the Flin Flon operation is directly under federal jurisdiction, the government has done nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712200">As the member of Parliament for our region, I believe that governments have to be engaged. The federal government must be at the table. These are tough times for northern communities and communities across the country. Our region and our country deserves better.</ParaText>

The costs associated with signing and implementing this global compact are unknown right now. Signing this compact could put an even larger burden on the backs of Canadian taxpayers. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5712588"> moved that Bill <Document DbId="8353293" Type="4">C-316, An Act to amend the Canada Revenue Agency Act (organ donors)</Document>, be read the third time and passed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712589"> He said: Mr. Speaker, it is my honour to rise to speak to my private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="8353293" Type="4">C-316</Document>, at third reading.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712590">For those who may not be familiar with Bill <Document DbId="8353293" Type="4">C-316</Document>, it is a legislative proposal that would allow Canadians to indicate their interest in being an organ and tissue donor through their annual tax forms. It is just that simple.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712591">Right now, the tax forms can only be used for the collection of taxes. This bill would create a legal exemption, just like that made for Elections Canada, to allow this important question to be added to the tax forms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712592">If we have any hope of getting these changes to the tax forms implemented in time for the 2019 tax year, we need to move this through both the House now and the Senate early next spring. If we miss that deadline, the Canada Revenue Agency, CRA, will not be able to implement the required changes for another year. We cannot let that happen. We need to get this done quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712593">This bill was unanimously supported at both second reading and committee, and has progressed from its first debate in the House to its last debate in just 23 sitting days. I think that is a record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712594">I do want to reiterate my sincere thanks to all the parties in the House for showing such support and offering their genuine co-operation to move this proposal forward so quickly. In particular, I must express a great debt of gratitude to the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214218" Type="2">Red Deer—Lacombe</Affiliation> for the quick progress of this bill. The bill was not actually scheduled to be back for third reading debate until February 25 of next year, but the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214218" Type="2">Red Deer—Lacombe</Affiliation> graciously traded his position in the PMB calendar with me to make this debate possible today and to further ensure that this legislation is passed. I know the member for <Affiliation DbId="214218" Type="2">Red Deer—Lacombe</Affiliation> is a strong supporter of improving Canada's organ and tissue donation system, and his willingness to help prioritize this bill demonstrates that. His graciousness might be proven one day to have resulted in the saving of hundreds of lives. I sincerely thank the hon. member.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712595">I also want to thank all of my colleagues on the health committee who have been vocal, determined and dedicated supporters of this bill. As I said in the health committee the other day, “I have referred to this bill several times as 'my bill', as it stands in my name, but I do want to say that this is really our bill.” It is our bill, because we worked together in committee as a single team to make it a reality. We found a shared goal and a sensible solution, and worked together to make it happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712596">I also want to thank the government, yes, the government, for its allocation of $4 million in funding in the recent fall economic statement to facilitate the implementation of this legislation. Governments do not often commit funding ahead of legislation being passed, especially when for a private member's bill by an opposition member of Parliament. The fact that funding has been committed is very much appreciated and signifies an impressive willingness by the government to see this initiative happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712597">I must also thank Mr. Terence Scheltema, my assistant here in Ottawa, for his tireless efforts throughout the entire process of this bill. Without him, this bill would not be before us today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712598">My final thanks go to my friend, Robert Sallows, a double-lung transplant recipient who recently passed away at the age of 31. He was, and always will be, a hero and a true inspiration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712599">At the health committee last week, we had an opportunity to hear from CRA officials. They told us that for this proposal to be in place for the 2019 tax season, the legislation needs to be passed by early spring. I think that is quite possible, again, thanks to people like the member for <Affiliation DbId="214218" Type="2">Red Deer—Lacombe</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712600">A few other things became very clear in committee, and I want to talk about them for a moment. First of all, for this initiative to be most effective, the question about organ and tissue donation needs to be placed on the front of the tax form. The committee members made this very clear to the CRA. I was pleased that the CRA has acknowledged this as a priority of Parliament and committed to putting this on the front page.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5712601">I also think that the committee process was very informative and allowed the CRA to demonstrate its commitment to making this proposal a reality by working co-operatively with all provinces and territories on this matter. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712602">The path ahead for the CRA will require a lot of work and dedication by many people to make sure this change happens smoothly. In advance, I want to thank all of the CRA employees who will work on this project for their dedication and persistence. I know there will be days of frustration as small details are worked out and circled back and forth in the consultation process with the provinces and territories. However, when the 2019 tax forms come out and thousands, perhaps millions, more donors register, they will know they have played a key role in saving the lives of some of their fellow Canadians. Therefore, I implore the people at the CRA to dig deep on those tough days and push forward to make sure that we get this done as soon as possible with the highest rate of effectiveness. Their work will have purpose and the results will be rewarding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712603">One other aspect I want to spend a few minutes on is something the bill does not directly address, but is a significant problem in Canada. Research has shown that as many as one in five potential organ and tissue donors has their final wish overturned by their families at their time of death. That is 20% of families who are overturning the wishes of their deceased loved ones. That is just sad. The decision by their families are robbing those in need of a life-saving transplant of a chance to live. To me, this is unconscionable and has to change. We can and must do better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712604">It is beyond my understanding how we can allow people to die at a rate of five a week, while at the same time burying, incinerating or putting to rest perfectly good organs every single day. My daughters know I want to be an organ donor, and they know I expect them to follow through on this wish.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712605">As the Christmas holidays approach, families will gather in every corner of the country. I encourage willing organ donors to please speak to their families during this time, to make sure their families know that their final wish is to be an organ and tissue donor, and to let them know how they would feel if they were to find out the family failed to honour their wish.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712606">Throughout my organ and tissue donation advocacy work, both here and in Alberta, I have been approached by many people who have donated the organs and tissues of their deceased loved ones. Every single one of them has made it clear to me that they found the ability to donate to someone in need as a very essential part of their grief and healing process. Their ability to find some good in a time of utter grief and loss was profound and everlasting. Without exception, they encouraged me to let other families know that sharing their loved one made accepting their loss so much easier. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712607">Their loss has purpose, and their gift has brought unimaginable relief and joy to another family in need. By honouring the wishes of their loved ones, they have allowed grandparents, mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers to live. Their gift has meant that many parents have not had to see their children die. That is a legacy to leave for their loved ones. </ParaText>

He has done something that is done all too rarely in this House: He has reached across party lines, he has identified an issue of importance to Canadians and one that touches constituents of everybody in this House, and he has drafted a very practical and positive measure that is achievable. I want to congratulate him on that one more time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712611">I have two questions. We did hear evidence at the health committee, and I am sure the member is aware that having a presumed consent system, where all citizens are presumed to be organ or tissue donors unless they choose otherwise, results in very high rates of organ donation in other countries. I am wondering if the member thinks that is a step that this country ought to explore in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712612">Second, does the member believe that the government will co-operate with him in order to make this bill a reality so that we can get this question on Canadians' tax returns in time for the 2019 tax year?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5712613">Madam Speaker, on the first question with regard to presumed consent, I believe that if my bill is implemented, and implemented soon, I do not think the requirement for an opt-out system is necessary. I have high hopes that if the question is on the tax forms, which reach likely 90% of Canadians, those who make money and pay taxes, that would be all we need rather than having to go forward to a presumed consent. Of course, if it does fail and people do not tend to sign up on the registries through their tax form, then an opt-out presumed consent is perhaps something that we would need to look into.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712614">With regard to the member's second question, I certainly hope that the government continues to move forward in a positive direction. I am optimistic. The Liberals have provided the money to move forward on this, so I absolutely believe that they will continue to move this forward. I hope it does go quickly in the Senate because there is a deadline from the CRA, as I mentioned. </ParaText>

His personal commitment to this and the co-operative way he has worked with MPs from all parties has moved members of the House, as demonstrated by the unanimous all-party support Bill <Document DbId="8353293" Type="4">C-316</Document> received at second reading.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5712622">Our government understands that organ and tissue donation and transplantation is an important part of our health care system that relies on the generosity of Canadians to give the gift of life. We know many Canadians, when approached, are willing to be a donor, however, reaching them to get that consent is hit and miss.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712623">We all recognize that more work is needed to address the chronic shortages of organ and tissue donations for transplantation across the country. It goes without saying that transplants not only save lives, but also drastically improve the quality of life for the recipients. In some cases, transplants are the only treatment for end-stage organ failure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712624">The Canadian Transplant Society notes that more than 1,600 Canadians are added to organ wait-list every year. In 2017, more than 4,333 people were waiting for transplants across Canada. That same year, 2,979 organs were transplanted. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712625">Over the past decade, the number of deceased organ donors has gone up by 42%, so that is good news. While that is encouraging, unfortunately, the number of people needing a transplant has also gone up during that same time. In many ways, we are not making progress and many people are continuing to suffer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712626"> Hundreds of Canadians could no longer wait, and did not get a transplant in time. In 2017, 242 people died while waiting for a transplant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712627">As our population ages, the need for transplants will only increase. Any one of us could one day find ourselves in need of a donation. As I have mentioned before in previous debates on the bill, and I am sorry, I am getting a little emotional, my sons have a very rare genetic condition resulting in serious heart disease. The only option currently for my eldest when his heart fails to pump effectively is to have a heart transplant. I am hopeful for more options in the future through cardiac and transplant research. However, we must do more to ensure Canadians have timely and effective access to the care they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712628">That is why the government is standing in support of Bill <Document DbId="8353293" Type="4">C-316</Document>. By working together, we can improve the organ and tissue donation and transplantation system and ensure that Canadians have timely and effective access to that care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712629"> Bill <Document DbId="8353293" Type="4">C-316</Document> would enact a provision that would authorize the Canada Revenue Agency to enter into an agreement with a provincial or territorial government to collect information required for establishing or maintaining an organ and tissue donor registry in the province or territory.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712630"> Specifically, the CRA would collect and share personal information for individuals who wish to receive information from their provincial or territorial government on becoming an organ or tissue donor. A memorandum of understanding with the willing provinces and territories would need to be signed so the CRA could share information from potential donors. To this end, the CRA would work diligently with provincial and territorial governments to put these agreements in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712631"> Canadians can be assured that we are committed to improving the organ and tissue donation and the transplantation system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712632">In the meantime, people need to know that registering to donate is not complicated and that registration can be done at any time. We know one organ donor can potentially save as many as eight lives and a tissue donor can improve the quality of life for up to 75 people. This is the gift of life, not only for the individuals with the serious health problems who are direct beneficiaries, but also for their family members and loved ones.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712633"> I want to mention again the significance of this gift of life, as we saw in the Humboldt disaster. I am sure people have heard the stories by the member opposite. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5712634">I have my own story in my own community. A vibrant, loving young mother, an inspired teacher, suddenly lost her life when she suffered a stroke. She had signed up to be a donor and was able to give the gift of life and improve the outcomes for eight other people. Out of one family's pain came joy for eight other families who were forever grateful for her final act of kindness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712635">Living donors who are at the age of majority and in good health can donate a kidney, part of a liver and a lobe of a lung and continue to lead full and rewarding lives. We know that one donor, as I said, can potentially save up to eight lives and improve the quality of life for up to 75 people. Lives are transformed through these miracles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712636"> Canadians can count on this government to continue to improve the organ and tissue donation and transplantation system. To demonstrate this commitment, the <Affiliation DbId="233811" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> announced on October 18, 2018, renewed funding of $3.3 million for the Canadian donation and transplant research program, CDTRP. This funding allows the CDTRP to continue its research to advance organ and tissue donation and transplantation in Canada. It is through research that we can increase the availability of transplants for Canadians and transform clinical outcomes for transplant patients from coast to coast. It is absolutely incredible what is being done in research institutions in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712637"> I had the opportunity to see the work being done in Toronto at the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre. They were working on keeping a cow's heart alive outside of the body for weeks, which would provide an opportunity to do external repairs to fix damaged organs and potentially allow for treatments that would not be possible implanted in a body. This is most promising research to be able to make best use of all the organs donated, as many get rejected due to defects or disease.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712638">Our government is committed to supporting Bill <Document DbId="8353293" Type="4">C-316</Document>.

              <ParaText id="5712639">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to stand on behalf of the New Democratic Party of Canada. All my colleagues in our caucus and I offer our support to this important bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712640"> Canada's New Democrats believe that we must make every possible effort to ensure that every Canadian who needs an organ or tissue transplant receives it. We know that one donor could save up to eight lives and benefit more than 75 people, yet at 18 donors per million people, Canada's current donation rate puts us in the lower third of developed countries. Therefore, I particularly welcome this bill as an attempt to try to remedy that unfortunate state of events, because allowing Canadians to register as an organ donor through their tax returns will no doubt help increase registration rates, improve consent rates and help build a donation culture in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712641">By way of background, Canadians are currently dying on wait-lists because our organ donation rate is so unacceptably and unnecessarily low. At present, only 20% of Canadians have joined their province's organ and tissue registry. Provinces like Ontario are taking steps to make it easier by asking about organ donations on health card and driver's licence renewals, which has increased registration. However, even with everything in place, some 20% of families refuse to transplant a registered donor's organs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712642">In its recent study on organ donation, the House of Commons Standing Committee on Health learned that of the 4,492 Canadians currently on the wait-list, 260 died waiting for an organ in 2016. In order to better meet that demand, improved coordination across provinces and territories is absolutely required.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712643">Bill <Document DbId="8353293" Type="4">C-316</Document>, the bill before the House, allows the federal government to coordinate with provinces and territories to allow Canadians to register as organ donors through their federal tax filing. In this case, individuals would be required to consent to the sharing of their information before the agency would share that information with the provincial and territorial levels of government for the purpose of receiving information that hopefully would result in their being added to an organ donor registry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712644">I pause here to say that, in my view, it would be better if there was a box on everybody's tax return that taxpayers could check off to directly indicate they want to be a donor and the information would go straight to an actual organ donor registry. That is not what this bill does; however, in my opinion, it is worthy of support, because I think it will improve the situation, but I think that a more direct portal and a national registry is ultimately a better way to go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712645"> Of course, this bill aligns with the long-standing advocacy and legislative work of New Democrat members of Parliament around organ donation. This bill is essentially a version of a previous proposal to create what I just referred to, a pan-Canadian organ donor registry, that would coordinate and promote organ donation throughout Canada. That bill had previously been introduced seven times both by Liberals and New Democrats. Judy Wasylycia-Leis, a New Democrat member of Parliament from Winnipeg, introduced a bill in 2002, 2003 and 2008. Malcolm Allen, who was a New Democratic Party member of Parliament from Welland, introduced a bill in 2009 and 2013. Unfortunately, of those five times that New Democrats have introduced bills to set up a pan-Canadian organ donation registry, neither the Conservative nor Liberal governments have ever taken up that excellent idea that would save lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712646">I want to share some facts with members and any of the Canadian public who might be watching this debate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712647">While 90% of Canadians support organ donation in concept, less than 20% have made plans to donate. Unlike the United States, Canada does not have a centralized list of people waiting for an organ. The current Liberal government voted against a bill in 2016 that would have supported the creation of a national registry to align with the United States to help identify those wishing to donate an organ and those who need them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712648">That leaves us with a patchwork of provincial and territorial systems, the efficiency of which varies greatly from province to province. In the case where someone dies outside of the province where the individual is registered for organ donation, it is unlikely that the hospital would be able to identify the individual as a donor. This is one of the reasons that a centralized national registry is so much better.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5712649">Online registration is available in only five provinces: my province of British Columbia, Ontario, Alberta, Manitoba and Quebec. Even if someone is registered as a donor, the family always has the final say. In Ontario, about one in five registered organ donors have their wishes overridden by family members, according to a 2016 report in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712650">To put this into perspective, for every patient in Canada who does receive an organ transplant, there are two more on the wait-list. In 2016, over 4,500 people were waiting for organ transplants, 2,800 organs were transplanted and, again, 260 people died waiting for a transplant that never came.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712651">In the past 10 years, the number of deceased organ donors has gone up, but the number of people needing a transplant has also gone up. In fact, over 1,600 Canadians are added to organ wait-lists yearly. While most Canadians consent to donate after death, it is also possible to donate organs while one is still alive. Living donors who are the age of majority and in good health can donate a kidney, part of their liver or even a lobe of their lung. About 1% of Canadians who die in hospital donate an organ, but 99% do not, which works out to about 18 per million, about half the rate in countries such as Spain, which is 34 per million, and the United States at 26 per million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712652">I want to talk about the presumed consent system, because that is why countries like Spain and other European countries have organ donation and transplant rates that are twice as high as Canada's. It is because they have moved to a presumed consent system, which means that every citizen is presumed to consent to be an organ donor unless they choose otherwise. Individual choice, of course, is respected, but it vastly increases the pool of people who are available for organ donation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712653">The truth is, as I said earlier, over 90% of Canadians agree with the concept of organ donation, but it is difficult or confusing for them to know how to do that, and so most of those wishes go unexpressed. However, if we changed our system to a presumed consent system, we would have the best of all worlds. We would still respect individual choice for those who, for a variety of reasons, do not want to donate, but we would vastly increase the number of organs and tissue available for donation and hence save the lives of so many more Canadians who are waiting for an organ transplant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712654">It is funny that Canada is the only developed country without national organ donation legislation such as the 1984 U.S. National Organ Transplant Act. The comments that I am making were borne out repeatedly when we studied this bill at committee, and I will read some of the comments we received from people with respect to a national database.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5712663">I was a health critic in the province of Manitoba. Every so often the issue of organ donation would come up. It was an issue of utmost importance, and one on which there was lobbying. At the time, provincial MLAs said that something needed to be put on driver's licences, that maybe people should have to opt out as opposed to opt in to organ donation. All sorts of ideas were put forward as to how we might get more people to participate in organ donation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712664">I did a quick search on Google to get a better sense of organ donation. Well over 50 lives can be directly affected through the untimely passing of an individual who made the commitment to organ donation. The individual's passing could contribute to 50-plus lives being saved in a profound and positive fashion. When I say “positive”, I mean it could be anything from a life-saving heart transplant to a tissue transplant. The recipient might not be in a life-threatening situation but the donation of either an organ or tissue would be very important to him or her. </ParaText>

It is important to recognize, as the member across the way has done, that Ottawa needs to play a strong leadership role. My New Democrat friend referenced the importance of having a national registry. That may be something we could strive for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712666">On a Saturday a few weeks back, I met with a constituent at a local restaurant. The individual was virtually in tears when he talked about his niece who needed an organ donation. She had lived in Winnipeg but had moved to another province. It is hard to think of a young 15-year-old or 16-year-old girl with so much potential having to plead for help. She lives in Alberta and there are special circumstances surrounding the situation. My daughter, who happens to be an MLA, became engaged in the situation. We appealed through some media outlets for help and we are hoping and praying that the appeal will be successful.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5712667">There are far too many examples I could cite. I suspect that if we were to canvass all 300-plus members of Parliament, we would hear some very personal stories about how individuals could be assisted, lives could be saved and so forth. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712668">I truly believe that we are moving forward, but not nearly as fast as we could be on this particular issue. I would like a bigger commitment to co-operate and facilitate something that would be in the national interest in terms of having a data bank from coast to coast to coast. That is ultimately what we should strive to achieve. However, we should not kid ourselves. It is not easy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712669">If members do a quick search on the Internet, they will find that different provinces have different approaches. If someone on Prince Edward Island needs a liver or another organ, that person, and his or her family, wants to know that whatever can be done is being done and that it goes far beyond the boundaries of Prince Edward Island. That is something we should strive for. Obviously, there are things in place to assist someone from P.E.I., but it is not as simple as it should be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712670">The point is that we need more organization, co-operation and collaboration among the different partners. I am referring to the provinces, territories and the federal government. That is what we need on the one hand. On the other hand, we need promotion to make the public more aware. We could talk about the statistics. There is no doubt that in Canada, we could do a lot better in terms of getting more people engaged by stressing how they could impact the lives of others by checking off a box.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712671">Organizations have gone out of their way to simplify the process. For example, in the province of Ontario, there are websites that are very simply designed. It is easy to navigate the system to register. There is a national website. Those who may be following the debate can go to the national website, which links to the many provincial websites so that no matter where people happen to live, they can become directly engaged.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712672">Some of the best known contributions are through blood banks. We talk about the G7 and western countries. In terms of Canada's participation in blood banks and organ and tissue donation, Canada does not fare very well. It is purely guessing on my part that one of the primary reasons is that we do not have a coordinated approach with the different stakeholders. I believe that could ensure that we have the ideal list. We need promotional campaigns and recruitment drives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712673">There has to be consent. All parliamentarians recognize the importance of consent. To that degree, it is getting people to buy in and provide their consent the best way we can.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712674">I appreciate what the member is attempting to do and hope that at some point, the bill will pass.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5712675">Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise to speak to Bill <Document DbId="8353293" Type="4">C-316</Document>. I want to start by congratulating the member for <Affiliation DbId="214390" Type="2">Calgary Confederation</Affiliation> for bringing the bill forward to the House of Commons and doing it in a manner that sought the support and input of many Canadians, and members of the House as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712676">The bill itself recognizes the value of organ and tissue donation and transplantation and the important role that plays in protecting the health and safety of Canadians. I think all of us at some point or other in our lives have known people who have been confronted with that situation, whether a family with a loved one who is on a wait-list, or someone else needing an essential organ or transplant for their future survival and ability to continue to live a good quality life, or a family that has to deal with the grief of losing a family member and is faced with a difficult decision at the time of their sudden death. That cannot be easy. I think we have all heard of many of these stories and situations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712677">The bill allows people to reflect upon their own lives and those of others around them. It gives them the opportunity to make a very important decision on what will happen to their organs and tissues upon their death, so those kinds of decisions are not left to others and family members at a time of tremendous grief. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712678">My colleague, the member for<Affiliation DbId="214226" Type="2"> King—Vaughan</Affiliation>, who spoke earlier was very emotional in her speech, but was certainly able to relate to this particular situation in a way that many of us cannot. She talked about her own family and how this issue has hit the heart of it, with the emotional decisions and trauma of having a family member who might need an organ transplant at some point, and their reflections on that decision. Obviously, this bill will go to heart of what many Canadians and many families might face in this difficult situation they might face in the future. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712679">We also know that the bill before us today is one of the pieces of legislation the <Affiliation DbId="233811" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> and our government have been following through on in their mandate. The minister has been working with provinces and territories on this very legislation to try to facilitate some collaboration, some partnership, across the country when it comes to an organ and tissue donation and transplantation system that would give Canadians timely and effective access to the kind of care they need. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712680">I think most of us who listened to our colleague from the NDP cite the statistics of the numbers of people currently on wait-lists for organ and tissue donations and transplantation and of those who have died waiting can agree that far too many people are still on those wait-lists. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="55">(1655)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5712681">We can also agree that far too many Canadians die waiting, waiting for organ and tissue transplants that are necessary for them to continue to live and have a good quality of life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712682">I do not think any Canadian wants that to happen. It is all our responsibility to allow for a system that will ensure more people become organ donors, that there is a system in place to allow those who need transplants to get them. It is all our responsibility as Canadians that if we can bring life to someone, we bring life to that person.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712683">In my riding, I have a very close friend and a family that went through such an experience. The family was faced with the decision upon the death of its son, which was very sudden, on whether to donate his organs for transplantation. That was a difficult decision, one I cannot even imagine. At a time when his parents were already shocked, heartbroken and in despair, they made a decision that their son's organs would be donated and used for transplantation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712684">Just recently, they had the opportunity to meet an individual who received one of those organs, an individual who today is enjoying a good quality of life, bringing joy to his family, to his grandchildren, watching his grandchildren and his children continue to grow and be a part of their lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712685">As difficult as it was for her, her husband and her daughter at that time, knowing that in some way their son had been able to give this gift of life helped them through what had been one of the most tragic and difficult situations in their lives. It has helped them look at grief in a different way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712686">It was probably a couple of weeks ago when I was listening to CBC Radio's <I>The Current</I> one morning. She was on the radio, talking about this situation and so was the recipient who had received the heart as part of that donation. It was one of the saddest yet most inspiring stories I had heard in a very long time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712687">I do not think any of us wish for any family to be placed in that situation. By allowing this as a question, as a part of the Canada Revenue Agency work that it does through the application process, in reaching out to all Canadians, creating that awareness and allowing Canadians to make that decision to become a donor, we not only give them a sense of comfort in the decision they make, but we give their families a sense of comfort as well. Hopefully, at the end of the day, we are able to bring light to more Canadians who need it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712688">I am happy to support Bill <Document DbId="8353293" Type="4">C-316</Document>. I know many members of the House will, including government members. I am proud of the fact that as a government we have already stepped up to do many of the things outlined in the bill. In addition, we have been able to invest more into research related to transplantation, this year it is $100 million additional, to ensure these transplantations are successful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712689">We are continuing to work with research agencies, with science, along with families to ensure we can improve the system of organ and tissue donation in Canada.</ParaText>

I would like to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="214390" Type="2">Calgary Confederation</Affiliation> for bringing this forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712691">One of my friends once told me that the best speeches are given from the heart, that it is not about great notes or somebody who writes us a good speech. My speech today is coming from the heart. I am going to tell a little story about Nick. I did speak to Nick and I asked him if I could speak in the House on why this was so important and why it was important to him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712692">I first met Nick 21 years ago when he showed up at my door with my oldest son. He was an eight year old. As soon as he walked into the house, I noticed he was coughing. I asked him if had a really bad cold and he said, no, that he had a chronic disease called cystic fibrosis and because of that he had a hard time breathing and a lot of digestive problems. He explained the whole disease to me. Nick became a huge part of our lives. He was my son's best friend through his whole time growing up. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712693">Nick's medication was kept in our cupboards. Oftentimes Nick would spend the night and he needed it to survive. Nick would come to the cottage with us and he would bring his breathing machine and his medications, but he never let it slow him down. There were a couple of times as Nick was growing up that he ended up in intensive care in the Halifax hospital because of his condition. A number of times we sat our son down, because they were very close, they had been friends since they were very young, and we told him we did not know if Nick would get out of the hospital. We had those conversations and we always knew it was a possibility. It was always really tough, when dealing with a young child and our own kids, trying to explain to them that this could happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712694">Nick was amazing. He continued to beat the odds and he got out of the hospital both times. I remember when the Children's Wish Foundation asked him what his wish would be. Unfortunately, at that point in his life, he was very sick. He said that what he really wanted to do was make memories with his best friends. Therefore, Nick, my son and one of their other friends went to the big city for the weekend. The foundation gave them money to go shopping. They went to movies, ate steaks and they made memories. To this day, at 29 years old, when they get together, they still talk about it. It was just such a wonderful thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712695">However, as everyone else was moving on, going to school and getting degrees, Nick was struggling more and more as he got older. Nick continued to go to university. He would oftentimes go for a semester and then have to take a semester off because he was too sick to continue. His dream was to become an architect. He continued to go to university and then he would take time off because of his health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712696"> About a year and a half ago, Nick got very sick. I remember talking to him and him saying to me, “It's like I'm breathing through a straw”. If we think about that, how would that feel? Every breath we take and feeling like we are breathing through a straw.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712697">Nick was put on the waiting list for a double lung transplant and he continued to deteriorate. One of the challenges for individuals who are that sick is having to deal with this. We live in a province that does not do transplants. Nick had to go to Toronto to have this transplant. His family needed $20,000 to be raised in our community in order for him to live there while he waited. Unfortunately, Nick ended up in intensive care on life support, waiting, because he was failing so badly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712698">However, this is a great news story. In July, Nick got a double lung transplant. It was a 10-hour surgery. He was on life support before the surgery. He is doing great. He is out of the hospital. He is back home. He says that he will never take for granted every breath he takes. One of the things he is also very cognizant of is that somebody else died in order for him to have the transplant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712699"> It took almost two years for him to get a lung transplant. It is so important for us to sign donor cards and to ensure we have bills like this that will encourage more people to become donors so people like Nick are not left waiting for two years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712700">I am really pleased Nick is doing as well as he is. I want to thank the member opposite for the bill. It is very important that we continue to support these initiatives, that we continue to work with the provinces and territories and ensure we play a leadership role in transplants, ensuring they are available to people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712701"> It would be great if there were some way we could also support people financially so the communities do not have to raise as much money to send people to places like Toronto for their surgeries.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5712705">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House today to revisit a question I asked the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> earlier in the year regarding our supply managed farmers and the trade deals the government has signed, more specifically, the new United States-Canada agreement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712706">The three main pillars of supply management are control of the price, control of the production and import controls. If any one of those three pillars is affected, then like a three-legged stool, the system cannot sustain itself. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712707">We know that the system was created in the 1970s to deal with price fluctuations. Today we can thank it for employing 348,000 of our fellow Canadians, contributing $6.9 billion in tax revenues and contributing $29.6 billion to Canada's GDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712708">However, if we look at the trade deals the Liberal government has signed, the CETA, the CPTPP and now the USMCA, we see that despite the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214302" Type="4">agriculture minister</Affiliation> standing in this House and repeatedly talking about how he supports the system, the Liberals keep partitioning off parts of the market that we hold so dear. If we look at the dairy sector, with CETA, we lost 1.4%. Under the CPTPP, we lost 3.1%, and now, under the USMCA, it is 3.6%. If we add that all up just for dairy, it means that a total of 18% of the Canadian market will be imported dairy products, which will result in an annual loss of $1.3 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712709"> When we ask Canadians about their thoughts with regard to our farmers and locally produced goods, they say, in overwhelming numbers, time and time again, that they prefer buying Canadian and supporting Canadian farmers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712710">I asked the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> if he was prepared to make concessions on the trade deal, and he said at the time that he was not going to reveal the government's negotiating strategy. Of course, we all know now that the Liberals have been partitioning off parts of our supply managed sector. However, Canadians overwhelmingly support it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712711"> One of the basic tenets of trade is that we seek a good in return for something we do not produce. Canadian farmers are more than capable, with our population of 35 million, to produce the eggs, produce the chickens and produce the dairy products we require. Furthermore, Canadians are more than prepared to support their local farmers to do that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712712">We know that the supply managed sector contributes to local food security. In my province of British Columbia, it represents 40% of agriculture. It is unique. It is the largest sector of any province in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712713">What I want to draw to Canadians' attention is that one party in this House has consistently stood up to defend supply management, and that is the NDP. I am very proud to be able to stand in this House as our party's agriculture critic to say publicly to our supply managed farmers that I am here, I support them and we will continue to call out the Liberal government on the parts of their market it is selling off to foreign interests.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5712714">Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for raising this important issue. The government strongly supports supply management, dairy producers and the Canadian dairy industry. Canada's supply management sectors are essential parts of a strong, prosperous agricultural sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712715">On September 30, Canada reached a historic trade agreement with the United States and Mexico. The new agreement means stability and security for our farmers when trading with their largest customer to the south, and it means a strong foundation for growth in the future. With this agreement, we have maintained the tariff-free access to the American market for Canadian exports that we have enjoyed under NAFTA. That is good news for the 1.9 million Canadians whose jobs depend on trade with the United States. For our farmers and food processors, we have protected our $30 billion in agri-food exports to the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712716">Throughout the negotiations, our government worked extremely hard to advance the interests of Canadian farmers and food businesses. We know that they are primary economic drivers for this country. We know that they create well-paying jobs, particularly in our rural communities. At the same time, we fully recognize that the agreement will impact farmers and processors under supply management. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712717">It is important to remember that this U.S. administration was calling for the complete dismantlement of the supply management system. Our government defended and preserved our system from these very strong American attempts to see it dismantled. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has stated that our dairy, poultry and egg producers will be fully and fairly supported for any market losses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712718">Before we do that, we need to sit down with producers and processors. That is why we have formed working groups for industry and government to develop strategies for the short term and the long term.

The program is designed to support the productivity and competitiveness of dairy farmers through targeted contributions and to help the sector adapt to the anticipated impact of the new agreements. The producer portion of this investment is $250 million for the dairy farm investment program. That is why I want to emphasize and stress the point that our government continues to support our supply management industries.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5712725">Madam Speaker, before I get to the topic of my late show question, I do have to say that it is disappointing this evening to again see the government talk out, and therefore deny, the opportunity to expedite a good private member's bill. Bill <Document DbId="8353293" Type="4">C-316</Document> was debated tonight, and it would have been excellent if that debate had been allowed to collapse so that we could have ensured that it would meet the CRA deadline to get organ donor information included on tax forms. However, as we have seen on a number of occasions from this government, it insisted on filling the time and thus not allowing this good private member's to pass, even at the risk of the bill not now passing in time before the next election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712726">Nonetheless, I do want to address the issue of Christopher Garnier tonight. This issue has really captured the attention of Canadians. He is a person who received veterans benefits even though he never actually served in the Canadian Armed Forces. He received benefits related apparently to PTSD he acquired as a result of his commission of a terrible crime. The crime was the murder of Constable Catherine Campbell, who did serve her country as a volunteer firefighter and a police officer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712727">This obviously offends the sensibilities of veterans, as well as all Canadians, who were shocked to learn that someone who had committed a crime in Canada and never served in the Canadian Armed Forces was and is receiving benefits that are supposed to go to Canada's veterans. The government at the time did not provide meaningful answers. Subsequently, in response to our questions and advocacy, the Liberals have brought in policies that, hopefully, will prevent this kind of situation from happening again. Obviously, that is a positive step, but it remains the fact, as far as we know and have been told, that Mr. Garnier continues to receive those benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712728">Notwithstanding any policy changes in the future, I want to ask the parliamentary secretary about this specific case. Does he believe that Mr. Garnier should be receiving these benefits, which arise not from his service to this country, but rather from the apparent PTSD he got as a result of his terrible crime of murdering Constable Catherine Campbell? Does the parliamentary secretary believe that Mr. Garnier should still be receiving those benefits? Does he believe that? If he believes Mr. Garnier should not be receiving those benefits, then why will the government not act to ensure that in this specific case those benefits will not continue? If he does not believe that, maybe he should explain why he believes this person should still receive those benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712729">Again, should Christopher Garnier continue to receive benefits from Veterans Affairs despite never having served his country?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5712730">Madam Speaker, from the very beginning, the opposition has been asking the same questions and we keep going over the same topics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712731">To begin with, I want to say that our hearts go out to the family of Constable Campbell. It was a heinous crime that never should have happened. As my colleague knows full well, we cannot comment on specific cases for privacy reasons. However, this gives me an opportunity to explain some things that might help my colleague understand this case a little better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712732">When soldiers with the Canadian Armed Forces serve their country, their entire family also serves. Travel, the decisions involved and separation are all factors at play. We take a holistic approach to the well-being of our soldiers. That is why the programs and benefits offered through Veterans Affairs Canada are extended to veterans' family members. The support offered to a veteran's family also contributes to the veteran's well-being. This includes psychological support and services related to PTSD and other mental health problems. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712733">Mental health treatment best practices confirm that family members of veterans may need treatment. It can happen. Mental health services can become compromised if they fail to take into account the impact of a veteran's mental health on the family or the family dynamic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712734">Under extenuating circumstances, any treatment recommended for family members of veterans will be reviewed by an area director and a health professional. This is a new policy. It was brought in at the minister's request.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712735">I can assure the House that Veterans Affairs Canada has made changes to certain decision-making processes. Effective immediately, treatment recommendations for family members of veterans that are in the care or custody of a correctional institution will be reviewed by both Veterans Affairs Canada and a health professional.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712736">Services received within a professional institution will be the same as those provided by Veterans Affairs. In any event, the person will receive treatment either from an institution or Veterans Affairs Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712737">When we offer help to members of a veteran's family, whatever it might be, our priority is always the veteran's well-being. The health and well-being of all members and veterans of the Canadian Armed Forces are central to all of the programs and services. That includes mental and physical health. That is why Veterans Affairs Canada is funding a network of over 4,000 mental health professionals across the country so that veterans who need those services have access to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712738">The department is also funding a 24/7 toll-free assistance service, which enables veterans and eligible members of the RCMP to get counselling, bereavement support and referrals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712739">In order to better meet mental health needs, our government is investing $17.5 million over four years to open a centre of excellence on PTSD and related mental health conditions. This centre will provide new knowledge and best practices to front-line health professionals across the country who help veterans and their families every day.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5712745">Madam Speaker, I am very proud to rise in the House to stand up for farmers across Canada, especially the people of <Affiliation DbId="214056" Type="2">Salaberry—Suroît</Affiliation>, who work tirelessly to feed the people in our region and also just to survive. Unfortunately, that is the reality they must face. They are just surviving and do not earn a decent living from working the land.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712746">The NDP supports farmers and is determined to preserve the integrity of the supply management system and the Canadian dairy system. For years, we have been calling for the full protection of the supply management system. Unlike the Liberals and the Conservatives, we believe that Canada should not have made concessions in the CETA negotiations with the European Union, or in the TPP negotiations, or in the recent negotiations between Canada, the United States and Mexico.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712747">Mr. Trump was expecting Canadians to accept similar concessions because the Conservatives and the Liberals had already made them in the two previous negotiations for the TPP and CETA. Unfortunately, the U.S. got their concessions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712748">The Liberals made some significant concessions. In total, these three agreements signed over three years account for a 10% breach. This is the equivalent of about one month of a farmer's income. Farmers have said that they are having to forgo 28 days of income because of these three international agreements. I do not think anyone in this House would easily give up a month's worth of work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712749">Furthermore, in the latest agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico, access to Canada's dairy market was expanded by 3.6%. The Canadian government abandoned class 7 and is also allowing a new dairy product, diafiltered milk, to enter the Canadian market. Canadians fought to say that we should prioritize Canadian milk. They said that when other classes are allowed to cross the border, it is harder to know where the milk in our products comes from.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712750">As a result of all this, farmers will lose more than $200 million in revenue a year, and the agreements will also limit supply-managed exports to levels lower than they were in 2017.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712751">The government also signed away its sovereignty by giving the Americans oversight of the classification of dairy products. Farmers are strongly opposed to this. They never expected this to come up in the negotiation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712752">The Liberals claim to defend supply management and say they are going to offer compensation programs, but so far no such program has been offered to farmers following negotiations with the U.S. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712753">As for the meagre compensation offered last summer, it was the middle of July and it was handed out on a first-come, first-serve basis. Farmers fell off their chairs and said that it made no sense, because it did not meet their needs and it really was not fair for all the farmers who were busy working in their fields. Nobody could make head nor tails of it. The Liberals understood and acknowledged that it was ad hoc and that they should not have gone about it like that, but they still have not offered farmers an alternative.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5712755">Madam Speaker, the government understands the importance of the Canadian agriculture and agri-food sector to our economy, our trade and our jobs. Our negotiators worked hard to advance Canadian agricultural interests at the table. The Canada-United States-Mexico agreement preserves existing agriculture commitments in North America and helps grow an already highly integrated industry. This agreement maintains the three pillars of supply management: production controls, price controls and import controls. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712756">The Government of Canada strongly supports Canadian dairy, poultry and egg farmers, and our supply management system. Around the world, our supply management system is viewed as a model of stability. It provides a fair return for farmers, a predictable supply for processors, and high-quality dairy, poultry and egg products for consumers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712757"> Canada's dairy, poultry and egg producers and processors are vital to the prosperity and sustainable growth of our nation and are an integral part of Canadian agriculture. Production and processing activities contribute to multiple other industries, all of which help support local economies and create vibrant rural communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712758">Promoting trade and maintaining our supply management system are not mutually exclusive. Canada has a proven track record of negotiating high-quality free trade agreements with major trading partners while maintaining the pillars of supply management. Through CETA, the CPTPP and the renegotiation of NAFTA, the biggest free trade deals in Canada's history, we have been able to preserve, protect and defend our supply management system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712759">The government stands strongly behind the dairy, poultry and egg industries, and together we will work to assess the impacts of the new NAFTA and CPTPP on the sectors. To this end, the government will continue to work with dairy, poultry and egg farmers and processors as part of the government's recent commitment to form working groups that will discuss the details of the recent agreements and collaborate to develop strategies to help them adapt, innovate and remain competitive.</ParaText>

However, in their three years in power, they have signed three trade deals that have collectively opened up a 10% breach in the supply management system. For farmers, that amounts to a month's salary being given away in the last three trade deals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712763">How can the parliamentary secretary talk about stability? How can he say the system is working? How can he talk about compensation when no timeframes or programs have even been announced?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5712764">Yes, the Liberals are holding consultations, but that is not going to save jobs. The agri-food sector provides one in eight jobs. Dairy farms revitalize our regions, maintain local jobs, keep young people from moving away, and create jobs and SMEs.</ParaText>
