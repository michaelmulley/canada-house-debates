The petition has been signed by 554 Canadian citizens of Sudanese origin and residents of Canada. Sudanese applicants for Canadian visas are obliged to travel all the way to Egypt, over 2,000 kilometres, Ethiopia, or the U.A.E. in order to do a 30-minute process of having their biometric fingerprints taken, which is an inconvenience for many Sudanese Canadians. The petition calls upon the Government of Canada to provide visa and immigration services including biometric fingerprinting in Khartoum, Sudan for Sudanese applicants for Canadian visas.</ParaText>

The petitioners are calling on the government to recognize that other family members may take care of children while their parents are incarcerated or homeless. Because those other family members are not eligible for family-related benefits, children miss out on that support. It is important to understand that family situations are not the same as they were back in the day. I sincerely hope the government will take action on this issue.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5523846">Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 52, I am requesting an emergency debate on the Trans Mountain expansion project. On April 16, the House did convene an emergency debate on Trans Mountain which was granted because thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of investment were at risk, but today thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of investment in Canada and the Trans Mountain expansion itself all remain at risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523847">There are two new developments that warrant Parliament convening another emergency debate. The first is the federal government's purchase of the existing Trans Mountain pipeline. Construction is stalled indefinitely, costs are increasing and Canadian taxpayers deserve answers as to how and when the expansion of the pipeline they now own will be built. The government was forced to take over the expansion because the Liberals failed to provide certainty that construction could proceed even though they promised legislation in the spring that they failed to deliver. The second development was the Federal Court of Appeal ruling that the Liberals failed to adequately consult first nations on the expansion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523848">Thousands of workers had jobs that they were about to start but which disappeared overnight. For almost three weeks these laid-off workers have been questioning if they should wait for work to resume or if they should find alternative employment. To date, the federal government has yet to announce a plan for how it will either fulfill the requirements of the Federal Court of Appeal and/or ensure the expansion can proceed through other means. The Liberals have delivered no plan at all.</ParaText>

Instead of coming forward with his plan to support Canada's energy sector and the livelihoods of the hundreds of thousands of Canadians who depend on it, the minister stated that it could be a week before a plan is unveiled and a month before action is taken. Canadian families cannot wait that long and for the workers affected, every day counts and every day damages Canada's reputation as a stable and predictable place for investment.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5523874">Mr. Speaker, as I have the opportunity to speak to Bill <Document DbId="9970461" Type="3">C-79</Document> today, I would like to extend my best wishes to people in Edmonton Centre, who are braving the snow and looking forward to a sunny fall before the snow actually stays for the winter.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="5523875">I will be sharing my time with my esteemed colleague from <Affiliation DbId="214354" Type="2">Rivière-des-Mille-Îles</Affiliation>. We are beginning the debate on Bill <Document DbId="9970461" Type="3">C-79</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523876">Our government strongly believes that the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-Pacific partnership, or CPTPP, is the best deal for Canadians and for our economy. The CPTPP is a historic new agreement between Canada and 10 other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, namely Australia, Brunei, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523877">Once it comes into effect, the CPTPP will constitute one of the largest trading blocs in the world, representing close to 500 million people and 13.5% of global GDP. The agreement will generate major economic benefits for Canada thanks to trade with countries like Japan, our fourth-largest trading partner and top source of investment from Asia, and with fast-growing economies like Malaysia and Vietnam. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="5523878">Today, I would like to speak to how the CPTPP will facilitate foreign investment into Canada and provide protections for Canadians looking to invest in CPTPP markets. Investment at home and abroad is vital for the Canadian economy. Foreign investment contributes to job creation across the country. It also promotes trade by facilitating integration into global value chains, improving access to new technologies and enhancing our competitiveness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523879">According to economic modelling by Global Affairs Canada, the CPTPP will spur an additional 810 million dollars' worth of investment into Canada, and will encourage increased and diversified Canadian investment throughout the Asia-Pacific region. It will achieve this by creating a predictable investment environment to ensure that investors are treated in a fair and equitable manner in all CPTPP markets. If a company is going to invest its capital abroad, it needs to know that capital is safe and secure and is going to provide a return on investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523880"> The CPTPP will establish a comprehensive and enforceable set of investment protection provisions. It will provide new, more robust obligations on non-discriminatory treatment of CPTPP businesses and investors. These will benefit Canadian businesses through better protection from expropriation or nationalization without compensation, elimination of unfair requirements on foreign investments that favour domestic industries, and easier transfer of capital and profits to and from the host country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523881">To ensure that these obligations are observed by all member countries, the CPTPP also introduces and includes a fair and impartial mechanism for the resolution of disputes. Investor-state dispute settlement, or ISDS, is an important component of international trade and investment agreements. With an ISDS mechanism in place, Canadian investors will have greater confidence that they will be treated in a fair and transparent manner in other CPTPP markets. It will also provide an impartial means to resolve any investment-related disputes in the event that specific obligations under the CPTPP are breached by a government. Such protections will help facilitate two-way investment by providing a transparent and predictable investment-friendly environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523882">The agreement, once implemented, will encourage Canadian companies to look to fast-growing markets across the CPTPP region to grow their businesses. It will encourage investment in Canada and CPTPP countries. It will also connect Canadians with partner investors and businesses in new markets, and help our businesses further integrate into global supply chains. In doing so, it will create new opportunities and generate jobs for Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523883">It is important to emphasize that while the CPTPP's ISDS rules will help protect Canadian investors abroad and serve to attract foreign investment to Canada, the rules outlined in the CPTPP will also preserve the Government of Canada's right to regulate to achieve legitimate policy objectives. Under the CPTPP, Canada has taken certain exemptions to CPTPP obligations that allow continued policy flexibility to regulate in the public interest in sensitive areas such as health, education, indigenous affairs, culture, fisheries and certain transportation services.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="5523884">Foreign investors in Canada and all the other CPTPP nations will be required to follow the same laws and regulations as Canadian investors, including laws and regulations aimed at protecting the environment and maintaining high workplace health and safety standards. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523885">The investor-state dispute settlement mechanism, or ISDS, gives investors a way to resolve disputes without resorting to the national justice system of the host nation, but it is not a blank cheque. Damages could only be recovered if specific requirements under the agreement were violated. The ISDS tribunals would never have the power to nullify government decisions or laws. They would only be authorized to grant investors compensation for damages resulting from violations of the treaty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523886"> By suspending certain ISDS provisions that were included in the original TPP, the CPTPP ensures that the ISDS complies with Canada's standard, balanced approach to investment obligations in free trade agreements.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="5523887">This reflects the concerns that were heard from Canadians through extensive consultations, and I am proud to say that the CPTPP gets ISDS right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523888">To reiterate, CPTPP will not prevent Canada from protecting the environment or maintaining or enhancing labour, health, and safety standards. In short, it will allow us to continue promoting the values that Canadians cherish, which are the values that make us Canadian.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523889">I would like to highlight for residents of Edmonton Centre, and for all Albertans, that this CPTPP is one of the most comprehensive trade agreements that our country will enter into. It comprises 11 countries: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. Once approved, it will open up a market of an additional 500 million consumers, resulting in 40% of the world economy being able to trade with us when we add in CETA, NAFTA and South Korea. This demonstrates our commitment to opening up new markets. It is an important agreement because it will eliminate over 95% of tariff lines, representing over 98% of total trade and over 99% of Canada's exports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523890">I want to highlight the importance of this for Alberta industry and Edmonton companies. Let us take a look at the agriculture provision. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523891">When CPTPP enters into force, more than three-quarters of agriculture and agri-food products will benefit from immediate duty-free treatment, with tariffs on many other products to be phased out gradually. This means new market access opportunities for Canadian pork, beef, pulses, fruit and vegetables, malt, grains, cereals, animal feeds, maple syrup, wines and spirits, and then processed grain and pulse products as well. All of these products hail from my province of Alberta.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523892">Let us take a look at industrial goods. Under the agreement, 100% of tariffs on industrial goods and consumer products will be eliminated. The majority of Canadian industrial goods exported to CPTPP countries will be duty-free immediately upon the entry into force of the agreement, with most remaining tariffs on industrial goods to be eliminated within 10 years. That is also good for Alberta and Edmonton businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523893">On forestry and value-added wood products, CPTPP will eliminate tariffs on all Canadian exports of forestry and value-added wood products. Many will enter into force immediately, while others will be phased out over 15 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523894">With regard to services, our economy is diversifying in Alberta. Many companies in my own city of Edmonton will love the provision in CPTPP that will provide more secure access through greater transparency and predictability in the dynamic CPTPP region. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523895">I would like us to think about professional sectors like engineering, architecture and those related to environment and mining. My riding of Edmonton Centre alone is headquarters to the seventh-largest engineering and design firm in the world, Stantec, and one of the world's largest construction companies, Poole Construction Limited, known as PCL. This is the kind of free trade deal that allows these companies, as well as small and medium-sized enterprises, to continue expanding around the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523896">In terms of government procurement, this agreement will provide more transparency and opportunity for companies in my hometown of Morinville, in St. Albert and in Edmonton to compete on the global stage. It is what we promised Canadians during the campaign. It is what our government has been doing. It is what we will continue to do: opening up markets, creating jobs, and growing the Canadian economy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5523897">Mr. Speaker, I would like to raise a question about what is not in this deal. This deal looks like it was maybe drafted in the 1990s. There is no mention of climate action and no mention of sustainable development. It contains very dated environmental measures. It completely derogates from the strong measures in the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation. There is no council of ministers, and no right of the public to petition on a complaint of failed enforcement. It fails to recognize the rights in Canadian law for citizens to file environmental actions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523898">The member and his government always say the environment can go hand in glove with economic development and trade. Why then is it accepting downgraded measures that were put in place decades ago in the NAFTA agreement?</ParaText>

In the case of CPTPP, as I mentioned, there are exemptions in Canada for culture, labour and environmental considerations.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5523909">The trans-Pacific partnership is a very important agreement. As the member for <Affiliation DbId="214526" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> said earlier, Bill <Document DbId="9970461" Type="3">C-79</Document> is historically significant. It opens up a new market of 500 million consumers. This will help SMEs and create jobs for the middle class. It is something that is very important to me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523910">For two and a half years I was a member of the Standing Committee on International Trade, where we studied this agreement. We visited this country from coast to coast, meeting people in many towns and cities in every province. We wanted to give everyone a chance to have their say on this very important matter. We also met with many representatives from the labour movement, civil society, business associations and chambers of commerce. We were also the first committee to have open-mike meetings so that everyone would have a chance to speak, and we certainly took their comments into consideration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523911">Let us think about it: eleven countries, namely Australia, Brunei, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam managed to come together to reach such an important agreement. We are opening up access to these markets and that is very important. We already have a free trade agreement with Europe, we will have one with Asia-Pacific countries, and we are currently negotiating to open up markets. With all these free trade agreements, Canada will be well positioned to grow the middle class and create good jobs for our SMEs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523912">I am very pleased to talk about the CPTPP and the positive impact it will have on businesses in Canada's industrial and manufacturing sectors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523913">My riding is a suburb north of Montreal with a huge number of SMEs and businesses that work in the aerospace, agri-food, and food processing sectors. These sectors produce a wide range of products across the country from cars to medical equipment, metals, chemical products and plastics. They are key components of our country's economy that employ 1.7 million highly qualified Canadians full time and account for nearly 11% of Canada's GDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523914">Our government firmly believes that the CPTPP is an ideal agreement for Canadians and for our economy. This is a top-notch trade agreement that will help increase Canadian exports.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5523915">As a cornerstone of our government's comprehensive effort to enhance Canada's engagement with the dynamic, fast growing and increasingly influential Asian markets, it is an important part of our commitment to diversify trade, grow our economy and strengthen our country's middle class. Trade and investment flows between Canada and Asian economies have increased significantly since the turn of the century. From 2014 to 2016, Canada's exports of industrial and manufactured goods to CPTPP countries accounted for an annual average of $22.4 billion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523916">By eliminating nearly 100% of tariffs on manufactured goods, including some tariffs that are as high as 85%, and creating mechanisms to address non-tariff barriers to trade, the CPTPP would create opportunities for world-class Canadian businesses to increase their sales. Once the agreement enters into force, it will enable Canadian exporters to access diverse and internationally integrated value chains. On day one of the agreement's coming into force, there will be no tariffs on over 87% of industrial tariff lines covering Canadian exports to CPTPP markets worth an annual average of $19.5 billion from 2015 to 2017. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523917">What does this mean for our industries? Allow me to provide a few examples. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523918">For Canada's multi-billion dollar chemicals and plastics industry, the CPTPP will provide opportunities for companies, from those in Ontario, the hub of Canada's plastics industry, to cutting-edge chemical facilities in Alberta. With improved market access from the elimination of tariffs of as high as 50%, this industry will increase its annual average of $1.1 billion in exports to CPTPP markets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523919">With respect to metals and minerals, a sector contributing nearly 600,000 jobs across Canada and exporting $5 billion in goods to CPTPP markets, the agreement will result in the elimination of all tariffs, some as high as 50%. As a result, highly sought-after Canadian aluminum, steel, iron, petroleum products and precious metals will become even more competitive in such markets as Japan, Australia, Malaysia and Vietnam. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523920">Canada's information and communication technologies sector, critical to major urban centres across Canada, is also well positioned under the CPTPP to meet growing needs within established and developing markets in the Asia-Pacific. In addition to eliminating tariffs, the agreement will protect companies from having to divulge their proprietary information in order to sell their products in CPTPP markets. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="5523921">Our government listened to what Canadians had to say about the auto industry and made their concerns a priority. As part of the CPTPP negotiations, Canada obtained bilateral side letters from Australia and Malaysia in order to establish more liberal rules of origin, which would allow our automobile manufacturers to benefit from preferential tariff treatment on those markets without having to change their existing production models. We also reached bilateral agreements with Japan and Malaysia regarding standards and regulations in the automobile industry, a key demand of industry stakeholders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523922">Those are just a few examples of the industries that could benefit from the CPTPP. By making Canada's industrial and manufacturing exports more competitive and by cutting the red tape that hinders access to dynamic, growing markets, the CPTPP will give Canadian businesses significant opportunities to increase their profits and create new quality jobs for the middle class.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5523923">Beyond tariff reduction, another aspect of the CPTPP that stands to benefit Canadian companies in these sectors is in the area of intellectual property. The CPTPP's provisions on intellectual property cover virtually all areas of trade and IP, including copyright, patents, trademarks, geographical indication, industrial designs, domain names, and enforcement. Most importantly, the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights will help protect Canadian innovation and investment as our businesses trade abroad. For many Canadian businesses, one of the most significant barriers to trade in some markets is uncertainty over the protection of intellectual property, including whether their intellectual property rights will be respected and enforced. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5523925"> Beyond tariff reduction and intellectual property rules, the CPTPP also addresses the costly non-tariff obstacles preventing Canadian companies from entering foreign markets. All CPTPP members have committed to eliminating restrictive red tape in sectors such as cosmetics, medical instruments, pharmaceuticals, and ICTs, and this will give Canadian manufacturing exporters greater certainty and predictability with the competitive advantages they have gained.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523926">The CPTPP marks a very important step in the history of trade in Canada. This agreement will be instrumental in diversifying our markets and promoting economic prosperity here at home. By establishing an effective, transparent, rule-based trade system with one of the most dynamic and fastest growing regions in the world, the CPTPP will open up new possibilities for exporters in our industrial and manufacturing sectors.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5523970">We were ready to get to work and spend part of the summer ensuring that this bill is passed as soon as possible. Why it is so important for us to be among the first six countries? It is simple. It is because after the first six signatures, after six countries enshrine the agreement, the CPTPP comes into effect within 60 days. If we are not there during that time, all the good agreements for exporting and importing with those countries will already have been concluded with the first six signatory countries. Canada will be left with crumbs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523971">The last one to arrive at the table in a large family gets whatever is left and often that is nothing at all. That is why we think it is absolutely urgent and necessary to ratify the CPTPP quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523972">We will obviously work with the government to adopt the CPTPP as quickly as possible, because it is important to our industry and to farmers. The Canadian Agri-Food Trade Alliance held two press conferences. They held a press conference and send out a press release to explain why we must adopt the CPTPP as quickly as possible. According to research commissioned by the Canadian Agri-Food Trade Alliance, this trade pact could increase Canadian agri-food exports by nearly $2 billion annually for a variety of agriculture products including beef, pork, grains, canola, pulses, soybeans, barley, sugar, and processed foods.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523973">That is the reality. We are talking about the economy. Canadian jobs will be in jeopardy if we do not move fast enough. We are deeply disappointed that the government took too long to finally grasp how important it was to sign the CPTPP as quickly as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523974">I hope the government finally gets it, for the sake of the people who produce these agriculture products, including beef, pork, grains, canola, pulses, soybeans, barley, sugar and processed foods. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523975">I would like to move on to another sector covered by the agreement that is raising some serious concerns. I am referring to the supply management sector. The agreement requires Canada to make concessions on supply management. Under the old agreement, the previous Conservative government foresaw that there would be consequences for producers in supply-managed sectors. That was why we instituted a 10-year compensation plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523976">The compensation plan provided up to $4 billion for producers in supply-managed sectors. We created it because we felt it was important to recognize that even though we had succeeded in negotiating a global economic agreement that was good for Canada, we had had to sacrifice part of the supply management quota, and producers deserved to be compensated accordingly. We allocated $4 billion, including $450 million for facility upgrades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523977">The response of the current government has been to offer no compensation program whatsoever. No wonder people are worried today. No announcements have been made on this subject, and no empathy has been shown towards producers in supply-managed sectors, even though they have willingly sacrificed part of their quotas for the good of the Canadian economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523978">The government created a little $350-million program to modernize farms and support processors. The Conservatives' plan allocated $450 million, in addition to more than $3 billion to protect quotas and offset the losses that supply-managed farmers could experience once the TPP is implemented.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523979">In short, the official opposition will support ratifying the CPTPP as quickly as possible, because this agreement is important to our economy. Once again, I hope that the Liberal government will not screw this up come signing time, and I hope that everyone will be there. I hope that we do not end up being a laughingstock on the world stage.</ParaText>

When he was there, the Prime Minister could have tried to deal with the situation before it got this bad.

              <ParaText id="5523991">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in the House to debate Bill <Document DbId="9970461" Type="3">C-79, the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-Pacific partnership implementation act</Document>. I would like to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="214072" Type="2">Abbotsford</Affiliation> for the excellent work he did on this agreement during his tenure as the international trade minister under the previous Conservative government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523992">I would like to begin by underscoring how important this bill is to our farming communities. According to the Canadian Agri-Food Trade Alliance, passing this legislation could boost the value of Canada's agri-food exports by $1.84 billion. This agreement will open up a whole new market where Canadian farmers will be able to sell their products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523993">In addition, given the uncertainty over NAFTA negotiations, it is even more crucial that we pass this bill so that we can further diversify our trade. When the United States starts imposing tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, Canada needs to find new markets for its products. When Canada loses access to a market and to thousands of jobs, it just makes sense to find a new market where we can sell the same products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523994">Furthermore, the countries that Canada will get access to through this agreement have a combined GDP of about $13 billion. These countries include Japan, which has the third-largest economy after the United States and China. This represents a market worth about three-quarters of the U.S. market. The CPTPP is an incredible opportunity to diversify Canada's trade and improve Canadians' economic well-being.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523995">When we look at all the benefits that the CPTPP will have for Canada once we pass this bill, it is hard to understand why the Liberals chose to ignore the opposition leader's request to recall the House of Commons to pass Bill C-79. The Conservative Party leader made that request because the agreement will only come into force once it has been fully ratified by six different countries. Mexico, Japan and Singapore had already ratified it by the time the request was made, so only three other countries needed to sign on for the agreement to come into force. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523996">If the Liberals had recalled the House to pass this bill during the summer, as we requested, Canada could have secured the earliest possible access to the new markets. Instead, they decided to take a chance that three other countries would ratify the agreement, costing Canada thousands of jobs. With NAFTA, the government sat on its hands while the other countries negotiated a free trade agreement, and it almost let the same thing happen with the CPTPP. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523997">The Liberals had no reason not to recall the House to pass this bill. The fact that they ignored this request shows that they do not take Canadians' economic well-being seriously. In fact, this Liberal government seems almost determined to make life harder and harder for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="55">(1155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5523998">First, the Liberals are imposing a carbon tax, but they do not want to say how much it will cost Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5523999">This tax will not reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It will only make Canadians' lives more difficult by encouraging investors to invest outside Canada, in countries with different environmental regulations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524000">Second, the Liberals are incapable of building pipelines like Trans Mountain and energy east. These pipelines would have brought new jobs to Canada and benefited all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524001">Finally, the Liberals refused to recall the House to guarantee that Canadians in every sector would have access to a larger market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524002">These three examples show that the Liberals are not fighting for the middle class and those seeking to join it. Instead, they show that the Liberals do not take Canadian jobs seriously. It seems that every time the Liberals announce a new policy, it discourages investment in Canada and stifles the creation of new jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524003">In closing, I would like to explain why I support the bill and free trade.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524004">In general, free trade is a good thing. It certainly has played a role in major changes around the world. For example, free trade has resulted in the rate of extreme poverty dropping from 44% to less than 10% since the early 1980s. Free trade has increased the life expectancy at birth from 53 years in 1960 to 70 today. There are fewer wars around the world because of free trade. When countries trade, they become more dependent on one another economically. When countries trade, it is no longer profitable to be at war. It is much more advantageous to keep the peace so that we can reap the mutual benefits of trade between countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524005">These are the many reasons why the previous Conservative government signed free trade agreements with many countries. It did so with Panama, South Korea, Honduras and many others. That is why the Conservative government negotiated the TPP and the free trade agreement with the European Union. On this side of the House, we support free trade for practical reasons and on principle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524006">Free trade also helps promote freedom. I have always advocated for human rights and freedom in my work here and elsewhere. Free trade is an essential form of freedom. Free trade implies that people have the right to buy and sell across borders as they see fit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524007">For all these reasons, I will vote in favour of this bill. Once again, I want to point out that my Conservative colleagues, like the member for <Affiliation DbId="214072" Type="2">Abbotsford</Affiliation> and the former prime minister, worked hard to ensure Canada's prosperity. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5524018">Mr. Speaker, our government strongly believes that the comprehensive and progressive trans-Pacific partnership agreement, or CPTPP, will help increase and diversify Canada's trade and investment in the rapidly growing Asia-Pacific markets and improve Canadians' economic prosperity. At the same time, the agreement will ensure that the benefits of trade are widely shared, in particular by making it easy for small and medium-sized enterprises, or SMEs, to take advantage of the opportunities it offers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524019"> Exports are essential for the health and vitality of Canadian businesses and Canadian SMEs play a key role in increasing trade and economic growth in Canada. Indeed, SMEs are the backbone of the Canadian economy. They represent more than 99% of all businesses, 90% of all private sector jobs and 10.7 million workers and they generate nearly 40% of Canada's gross domestic product.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524020">I forgot to mention, Mr. Speaker, that I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="213918" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524021">Only 11% of Canadian SMEs benefit from foreign markets, however, and our government is committed to helping increase that. Exports are vital to the growth of Canada's economy. That is why our government will help small businesses expand into new markets abroad by promoting exports through the negotiation and implementation of the free trade agreements, such as the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, between Canada and EU; and now the CPTPP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524022">The CPTPP will enable Canadian SMEs to enter the dynamic Asia-Pacific market through agreements that simplify the export process and increase SME participation in global supply chains. This agreement will strengthen our economic ties with some of our current free trade partners, such as Chile, Mexico, and Peru, while providing preferential market access to seven new free trade partners: Japan, Malaysia, Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Brunei. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524023">In addition, the CPTPP will eliminate tariffs and improve market access for Canadian companies, including SMEs. Upon implementation, 86% of signatory countries' tariffs will be instantly eliminated. This will apply to Canadian exports to CPTPP countries, with an average value of $28.3 billion per year between 2015 and 2017. Once the agreement is fully implemented, signatory countries would eliminate 99% of their tariffs. This will apply to exports to CPTPP countries that average $32 billion per year between 2015 and 2017. This increased market access will make our SMEs more competitive and position them for success. It will also create opportunities for Canadian SMEs to diversify their exports at a time when this is extremely important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524024">The agreement provides for enhanced market access agreements for our financial services and service sectors and a comprehensive set of investment protection provisions based on a strong dispute resolution mechanism for investments. These provisions will greatly benefit SMEs as they are disproportionately impacted by non-tariff barriers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524025"> In addition, the CPTPP will be a first in Canada in terms of free trade agreements in that it contains a chapter that specifically guarantees that small and medium-sized enterprises will be able to take advantage of the opportunities it creates. This separate chapter highlights the importance of SMEs, which are the backbone of our economy and an engine of economic growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524026"> These provisions will ensure that our entrepreneurs and small businesses have access to information tailored to their needs, making it easy for Canadian companies to explore and navigate their way around CPTPP markets and prepare for their successful business ventures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524027">Through the efforts of the committee, as well as collaborative mechanisms, CPTPP signatories will be able to share best practices on how to support their businesses and to co-operate through seminars, workshops, and other capacity-building activities aimed at helping their businesses seize the opportunities created by the agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524028"> The CPTPP will increase market opportunities for Canadian companies of all sizes and in all sectors and regions of the country. In the coming months, we will reach out to small and medium-sized enterprises across the country to ensure they have the knowledge and tools they need to take advantage of this historic agreement. At the same time, we will work to help Canadian SMEs to grow, expand their activities, increase their productivity and be innovative and export oriented so they can prosper and create good jobs for the middle class.</ParaText>

It will enable Canadian businesses to trade and invest in this dynamic and rapidly-growing region. Since Asia is a highly integrated and adaptable region, the benefits of CPTPP go well beyond access to new markets. This agreement will provide Canadian companies of all sizes with opportunities to enter into various regionally integrated value chains that are global in scope.</ParaText>

In my riding, in the town of Creston and area, dairy farming is a very important part of the agriculture industry and the economy. It seems like with every trade deal that gets signed dairy is sacrificed. I would like to hear from my colleague across the floor why it is okay to continually sacrifice our dairy farmers in these trade agreements.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5524050">I am pleased to have the opportunity today to talk about the significant benefits of the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-Pacific partnership, or CPTPP. I want to talk specifically about the Canadian fish and seafood sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524051">This agreement is extremely important not only for Canada, but also for Australia, Brunei, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. It is also important for us to have access to those markets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524052">The Canadian fish and seafood sector is vital to our economy and essential to maintaining a solid employment base in a diverse economy. We are fortunate to have a very prosperous fish and seafood sector. It contributes more than $2 billion to Canada's GDP annually and provides more than 76,000 jobs for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524053">Regionally, this sector offers economic opportunities to countless communities both on the coasts and even in Canada's interior.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="5524054">In the west, employment in British Columbia's fish and seafood industry accounts for approximately 12% of all jobs in this sector across Canada. In the Maritimes, more than two-thirds of the entire Canadian fish and seafood sector is employed across the provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador. Fishing is also important in Quebec and our northern communities in Yukon and Nunavut, while freshwater fishing is notably important for Manitoba.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524055">Commercial fishing is a valued industry in Manitoba. For over 100 years, Manitobans have been commercially fishing and harvesting fish. The majority of production comes from Lake Winnipeg and Lake Manitoba, but seven smaller lakes in the south and northern Manitoba are also fished. The resource is managed through the use of quotas, the mesh size of gillnets, by season, and by regulation of the number of licensed fishers. The management tools allow fish populations and the industry to remain viable. They also ensure that resources are shared equitably on all the lakes with not only non-indigenous people but also treaty indigenous people and Métis people. Since almost all of the commercial production is sold out of the country, the $30 million in annual sales represents a significant and important contribution to the livelihoods of Manitoba fishing families. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524056">In Manitoba, it is also important to maintain high quality. Manitoba is the only jurisdiction in the western hemisphere with an eco certified freshwater market. We have achieved a Marine Stewardship Council certification and are very proud of that. Now, 85% of the total fish harvested in Manitoba is exported to other markets. There are 3,155 licenced fishermen in Manitoba and 83% of these are of indigenous descent. They help support many indigenous communities and help provide a good livelihood and support for many families. There are 46 communities and first nations who are involved in this fishery and 294 resulting direct jobs that have improved people's quality of life from their involvement in the fishery. Many Canadians' jobs and livelihood depend on this sector, which is the economic mainstay of approximately 1,500 communities in rural and coastal Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524057">I will now focus on why free trade agreements and the CPTPP in particular are necessary to sustain and develop Canada's fish and seafood industry. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524058">Simply put, Canada's fisheries and aquaculture industries produce high-quality, sustainably sourced fish and seafood that help feed the world. The Canadian fish and seafood industry is export-oriented and depends on international markets. In Asia, increased demand from the region's growing middle class represents enormous potential for Canadian exporters of high-quality fish and seafood products. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524059">Once the CPTPP enters into force, it will provide Canadian fish and seafood exporters with preferential access to one of the largest trading blocs in the world, representing close to 500 million people and 13.5% of global GDP. Altogether, Canadians exported an annual average of $732 million in fish and seafood products to CPTPP markets from 2015 to 2017.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5524060">Japan is one CPTPP market where Canadian companies can expect huge growth opportunities. Japan is the third-largest economy in the world and imports more than 60% of its food on a caloric basis, so its demand for imported foods is high.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524061">Right now, Canada's ability to compete in the CPTPP markets is hindered by the high tariffs imposed on fish and seafood products like frozen snow crab, lobster, salmon, fish fillets, and oysters. These tariffs can range from 3.5% to 34% in CPTPP countries like Japan, Malaysia, Vietnam, and New Zealand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524062">When the agreement enters into force, more than 90% of the fish and seafood tariff lines will immediately become duty-free for Canadian exports, which had an average annual value of $647 million between 2015 and 2017. The remaining 10% will be phased out within 15 years.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="5524063">For example, close to 66% of Japan's fish and seafood tariff lines will be eliminated upon entry into force of the agreement, providing preferential market access for Canada's premium fish and seafood products, such as lobster, crab, shrimp, salmon, herring roe, sea urchins and halibut. Eighty-three per cent of Vietnam's fish and seafood tariff lines will become duty free upon entry into force, while all Canadian fish and seafood exports to Malaysia will become duty free on day one. Enhanced market access for Canadian companies through the CPTPP will create the conditions for increased exports and will contribute to the vitality of the sector and its greater long-term prosperity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524064">Additional rules for streamlined customs and administration procedures, as well as enhanced regulatory co-operation, will also help Canadian exporters and suppliers save time and money at the borders of CPTPP countries. With increased access and less red tape, these products will gain an advantage over those of competitors from countries that do not have preferential access to CPTPP markets. At the same time, each CPTPP party will maintain the right to take measures necessary for food safety and to protect against risks to animal or plant life or health while helping to ensure that market access gains are not undermined by unnecessary trade restrictions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524065">The CPTPP's clear rules on developing, adopting and implementing measures for food safety and the protection of animals, plant life and health ensure that any measures will be science based, risk based and transparent. Ultimately, these provisions will create a predictable training environment for CPTPP members, giving manufacturers and exporters a leg up in prospective markets. Consultations with the fish and seafood industry have been overwhelmingly positive. The feedback from Canadians making a living in this sector is that the fish and seafood industry stands to benefit from the elimination of tariffs, and they are excited about this agreement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524066">The CPTPP also includes an environment chapter that addresses a number of important global environmental challenges with binding commitments from CPTPP members to, among other things, combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and promote sustainable fisheries management, including through obligations to prohibit subsidies that negatively affect fish stocks. The environment chapter also establishes a framework for co-operation in areas of mutual interest. This includes, for example, working together to mitigate the impacts of climate change, promote and conserve biodiversity, address the illegal wildlife trade, combat invasive alien species and promote sustainable fisheries practices. By maintaining policy flexibility in areas, including fisheries and aquaculture, Canada will ensure the sustainability of our valuable fish resources now and into the future. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524067">By increasing and diversifying Canada's presence in major seafood markets in the Asia-Pacific region, this trade agreement has the potential to provide significant benefits to thousands of Canadians. By providing duty-free access to this huge market, CPTPP will help put more of our country's world-class fish and seafood products on more dinner plates and tables around the world. The fish and seafood sector contributes greatly to Canada's economic prosperity and standard of living, especially our coastal regions, but also to indigenous communities in the interior like Manitoba, and is vital to long-term growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524068">I am fully committed to supporting this sector and to ensuring that it remains a vibrant and integral part of Canada's culture and economy. That is why I encourage all members of the House to vote in support of this bill, to allow us to implement the CPTPP in order for Canadians, including indigenous fishermen and all fishermen in Manitoba, to reap its benefits.</ParaText>

For instance, with respect to the Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation, the Conservative government in Manitoba actually removed Manitoba from the Freshwater Fish Marketing Act and essentially caused a bit of chaos in the freshwater lake fisheries in Manitoba, which impacts indigenous fishers. Eighty-three per cent of the fishers in Manitoba are indigenous. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524072">I spent a long time talking to the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs and other groups, like the Manitoba Metis Federation, as well as other colleagues in the Manitoba caucus. We discussed how these fishers could eventually buy the corporation so they could be the owners not only of this resource but of how they market the fish and where that fish eventually goes. They could be real true partners in what actually happens. This is part and parcel of the things I am working on in Manitoba. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524073">Obviously, there are a few other questions and ideas the member raised related to chapter 19 of NAFTA, as well as other things, like how we resolve disputes. These are very important considerations. However, if we do not have those agreements and someone puts tariffs on our products, how do we then resolve that question? Do we start a trade war or do we have a mechanism where we could actually have an agreement and come to some sort of conclusion about unfair trade practices which may be on both sides? </ParaText>

We are proud of what she has been able to accomplish. These consultations were not very accessible to members of the public wanting to participate. The public did not get much warning that consultations on the TPP were being held. People did not have much time to prepare, get to, and participate in the consultations.

Should our supply management system disappear entirely, the poultry sector would lose 60,000 to 80,000 jobs. That does not even take into account concessions in the Canada-EU agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524093">All the agreements Canada has signed recently represent a 15% increase in access to our supply-managed markets. The government kept saying that it would protect our supply management system, but it has never said that it will fully protect it, so naturally, farmers have some fears and concerns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524094">We also have to think about timing. Right now we are debating ratifying the trans-Pacific partnership, and yet Canada is still negotiating with the United States. Several experts and groups have urged us to be cautious.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524095">By going ahead with this and supporting the trans-Pacific partnership, we will be giving other countries greater access to our supply-managed market. This could send Mr. Trump and our American friends a clear message: we are prepared to grant them even more access to our market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524096">These market losses will cause Canada's GDP to drop by between $4.6 billion and $6.3 billion. The study also found that dismantling our supply management system would provide no real benefit to Canadian consumers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524097">According to the Éleveurs de volailles du Québec, across the poultry industry the implementation of the trans-Pacific partnership will result in the loss of more than 2,200 jobs and cut $150 billion from Canada's GDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524098">It is true that our supply management system was created by the Liberals, but here it is being greatly weakened once more. We are witnessing its death by a thousand cuts. We are weakening our system to the point that it will no longer be worthwhile to keep it in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524099">The government is telling us that there is nothing to worry about and that there will be a compensation plan for producers, but producers are not interested. They do not want to hear about compensation. Canadian producers want the federal government to do its job. Promises need to be kept. We hope the government will hold its own in the NAFTA renegotiation. That said, up to now, it has not been able to stand up for producers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524100">We could talk about other problems with the trans-Pacific partnership. For example, there is the auto sector. Many people work in the auto and parts sector.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5524101">These people and a number of unions are strongly opposed to the CPTPP because it will not do much to help them. It is still causing a lot of uncertainty. Less stringent rules of origin expose Canada to competition with Japanese vehicles that have a lot more components from countries that are not members of the TPP, such as China, Thailand, and Indonesia. However, Canada is maintaining its commitment to gradually eliminate its tariffs in the auto sector over a short period of five years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524102">There are a number of reasons why we do not support the TPP. It jeopardizes jobs. The government is telling us that it is protecting jobs and will create jobs for the middle class, but it is putting these jobs and these workers in jeopardy.</ParaText>

We heard from representatives of unions, civil society, and the business community. The Canada brand is seen in a very positive light everywhere we went.

              <ParaText id="5524109">With regard to culture, many experts expressed concerns about the trans-Pacific partnership because the cultural exemption it contained was the weakest such provision to have been negotiated in a free trade agreement.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5524121">Mr. Speaker, I am privileged to stand in the House and speak to this very important issue. I had the privilege of being the New Democratic Party official opposition critic on international trade for four years in the last Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524122">Of course, the agreement that is the subject of discussion today that was known then as the TPP or trans-Pacific partnership, now renamed the comprehensive and progressive trans-Pacific partnership, was very much in the public domain at that time. I followed the details as that agreement was being negotiated fairly carefully at that time. Essentially, my concern comes down to a number of basic points. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524123">First of all, New Democrats have long been concerned by the secrecy surrounding the TPP and the CPTPP negotiations. Despite direct promises by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> during the last election to be transparent on trade deals, the Liberals continue to give Canadians vague updates and mixed messages. Today we faced the shameful action by the government that brought in time allocation to limit debate on this very important subject. The previous government did this almost 100 times and the present Liberal government seems to be trying to match it. That shuts down democratic debate. It prevents us from speaking our minds and representing our constituents, which we were elected to come here to do. I think it is deplorable and it ought to be condemned. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524124">Second, we have to recall that the trade committee held dozens of sessions, heard from more than 400 witnesses and received written comments from more than 60,000 Canadians. The overwhelming consensus was that 95% of those people, those good people who took the time to make their views known, were against this deal. Experts also point out that Canada under the CPTPP would lose 58,000 jobs due to concessions that would damage our automobile industry and our supply management system. I will explore that in a few minutes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524125">This deal also contains troubling provisions on foreign control of Canadian businesses, rights to privacy and intellectual property. This agreement contains extremely weak labour and environment standards. I would say they are virtually absent. The so-called side letters are almost toothless, not only because they are not in the main agreement but because of the language contained in them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524126">The New Democrats have, for decades now, been strong proponents of fair trade and fair trade deals that seek to raise the labour standards, improve environmental protection, protect our public services and culture, and increase jobs in the Canadian economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524127">I want to stop for a moment because I have heard, unfortunately, from the Liberal side of the House, some words that I think typify a very unfortunate approach to politics. We saw this in the last Conservative government under then Prime Minister Harper where if one was not in agreement with the government, then one was subject to a very simplified wedge politics approach that completely misrepresented one's position. It was repeated endlessly, so for instance if one did not stand with the Conservatives' tough-on-crime legislation, somehow one was on the side of child molesters. That approach to politics is deplorable in this House. I think Canadians reject it. We reject it. It does not do anything to advance informed political debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524128">I am hearing the same thing from Liberals in this debate that, because we are not in favour of this agreement or are doing our job as opposition by critiquing this agreement, we are opposed to trade. That is absurd and it is nonsense, yet the Liberals keep saying that. Every Canadian understands the importance of trade. Every Canadian wants Canada to be a positive trading nation. That does not mean that we will sign any piece of paper put in front of us. That does not mean that we will be in favour of any agreement, no matter how many jobs it costs Canada or how harmful it is to the Canadian economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524129">I want to state for the record that New Democrats are proud supporters of trade. We are strong supporters of Canadian champions and we want to build a strong trading nation in Canada that protects our environment, that supports labour and human rights and that also supports Canadian champions on the world scene.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5524130">The only major change that appears to be positive about this whole deal is that the Liberals put the word “progressive” in the title. This is a cynical and very transparent ploy that progressive Canadians will not accept. There is nothing progressive about this deal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524131">I want to talk for a few minutes about why this agreement is troubling and will start with the auto sector. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524132">The auto sector in this country is extremely important. Canada is the 10th largest vehicle producer in the world. The auto sector is the largest manufacturing sector in Canada. Over 120,000 employees are directly employed in the auto and auto parts sector and it is responsible for about $100 billion in factory sales and related economic activity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524133">What will the CPTPP do? Industry and labour groups in the auto and auto parts sectors that will be most affected by this and have been carefully monitoring this agreement over the last number of years are strongly opposed to it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524134">The auto industry is already in the crosshairs of the NAFTA negotiation and facing punitive U.S. tariffs. The industry does not believe the Liberals' claims that the CPTPP will open up markets in the Asia-Pacific, particularly Japan. In fact, anybody who watches auto industry patterns and trends will realize that by reducing tariffs in this country, we are going to see a flood of automobiles and automotive parts coming in from jurisdictions, and not the other way around. It will only increase the auto trade imbalance and further de-harmonize the Canada-U.S. auto industry. Why? Let us look at the rules of origin. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524135">Under the CPTPP, in order for a vehicle made in a TPP country to come into Canada tariff-free, 35% to 45% of it has to be made within a TPP country. Imagine that. If a car manufacturer sets up, say, in Vietnam or Malaysia, in order for one of its cars to come in tariff-free, only 35% to 45% of it has to be made in Vietnam or Malaysia. The rest of the car can be made outside of either of those countries in low wage jurisdictions like Bangladesh or India, or any other low wage jurisdiction that has no environmental standards and very poor labour and employment standards. Even if 35% to 45% is made in the low wage jurisdictions of Malaysia or Vietnam, 55% to 65% of that vehicle, the rest of it, will be made in an even lower wage jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524136">How on earth are major vehicle manufacturers centred in Canada that pay good wages, that pay workers' compensation benefits, that pay for health and welfare benefits, and that pay good taxes or support social programs in this country supposed to compete with that? Yet the Liberals expect us to believe that under this deal we are going to be making vehicles here and will be sending them to Malaysia. If anyone believes that, we have a bridge for sale.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524137">I want to talk about supply management. Supply management is made up of three pillars: price controls, production controls, and import controls. The Liberals continually say that they stand up for supply management in every trade deal, but what they do not tell Canadians is that in every trade deal they have signed, from CETA to the CPTPP, and probably with NAFTA today, they are chipping away at the import controls and letting each one of those great deals let more and more dairy products come in, 3% for Europe, and another 3.5% for the TPP countries. Who knows what we are going to give Donald Trump?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524138">That means that as they sit here and pretend to support supply management, the Liberals are eroding or sawing off that third pillar of supply management. Eventually it will be 15%, 20%, 25%, 40%, 50% of import controls and by that time supply management will have been killed from within.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524139">We saw what happened with Brexit in England. We saw the election of Donald Trump. What happened? Workers around the world have perceived that over the last 30 or 40 years under so-called globalization business has achieved everything it wanted, such as lower labour costs, deregulation, and liberalized trade so that global capital could move around the world. What has happened? The benefits of that have not been shared equally. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524140">That is why the British and American working class have rebelled against neo-Liberal trade deals, all of which have only done one thing: increased GDP for the top 1% to 10%, while 90% of the rest of us end up having poor jobs while we watch our manufacturing sector get hollowed out and good middle-class, family sustaining jobs sent to low wage jurisdictions.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5524141">That is what has happened under the Liberals, it is what happened under the Conservatives, and the New Democrats are the only ones who will stand in the House and fight for Canadian jobs and a strong Canadian economy here at home for everybody. We will stand against these lousy trade deals every time they are put before us in the House. That is what the CPTPP is, a lousy deal, and we will continue to fight against it until we can stop this agreement.</ParaText>

For two and a half years, I was a member of the Standing Committee on International Trade, and they never supported a single one. Some 500,000 jobs have been created for the middle class in Canada since 2015.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524144">Earlier the member mentioned auto parts. Consultations on the trans-Pacific partnership were held in every town and city in the country. We met with representatives of automakers and auto parts manufacturers associations, not only from the U.S., but also from Japan and Korea. Our government also listened to what Canadian auto sector workers had to say, and we made their concerns a priority. As part of the negotiations, Canada signed bilateral side letters with Australia and Malaysia, but there is also Japan.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5524146">Mr. Speaker, I heard this the other day in the House and I am going to repeat it, that the only thing consistent about the Liberals on trade is their inconsistency. I was carefully following the debate in 1988 when the Liberal Party opposed the free trade agreement with the United States. In 1993, I saw the Liberal Party campaign against NAFTA and say that it would pull out of it if it were elected. It was elected, but what happened? As is often the case with the Liberals, they campaigned from the left and governed from the right. They suddenly forgot that promise. Then they were for NAFTA. In terms of inconsistency, for the Liberals I guess it just depends which way the wind is blowing, and then they will determine their trade policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524147">I forgive my hon. colleague for not knowing this as I do not think she was present in the last parliament, but the NDP has supported two agreements. We supported an agreement with South Korea and an agreement with Jordan. We supported those agreements because we analyzed them and determined that the countries we would be trading with would be of benefit to Canada. We read the agreements and made sure that overall they would be of benefit to this country. The Liberals should try to do that sometime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524148">Finally, on auto and auto parts, if we go back and look at the facts, ever since we signed NAFTA, the auto plants in Canada have gone down and the auto plants in Mexico have gone up almost exactly in proportion. We have lost manufacturing jobs. Everybody who watches knows; it is common sense. If one signs an agreement with a country that pays one-third the wages we do and does not have any of the social programs we do, capital will likely go to that jurisdiction for it to operate its manufacturing plants there and then just ship the goods back to us. That is exactly what was done, and that is what this deal would do too.</ParaText>

When the member talks about trade and trade agreements, for all intents and purposes they do not support trade agreements, period. They might cite one or two, but when it comes to actually doing the assessment, we know that they do not do one. This very piece of legislation is a good example of it. They opposed this agreement before the details of it were even known. Once they received the actual agreement, then they justified their position. Their position was known before the agreement. Everyone knew that. Thomas Mulcair was going around saying that they opposed the agreement, yet he had no idea what was in it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5524153"> He said that the NDP does not support trade agreements, but that we might support a couple. Of course we support trade agreements. I have cited two that we support. Once again he has repeated that old canard that the NDP does not support trade. I have defied him to find one comment ever made by any New Democrat in the history of our party that indicates we do not support trade, yet he repeats his claim here. That is just misleading Canadians.</ParaText>

Speaking of suppositions, the present <Affiliation DbId="229209" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation>, when she was the critic for international trade, said this when the CETA text finally came out. Members can read it in the newspapers. She said she was looking forward to finally seeing the deal that she has been supporting all along. That is what the Liberals said about CETA. They supported CETA before they actually knew what was in it. Maybe that is why my hon. colleague has such projection on this issue, because what he is accusing the NDP of is really what the Liberals are guilty of.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5524157">Mr. Speaker, we are discussing Bill <Document DbId="9970461" Type="3">C-79</Document>, a bill to implement the new incarnation of the TPP without the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524158">The Bloc Québécois is sincerely and seriously concerned about supply management and the breaches that are included in this new version of the agreement. The government gave up 3.25% of the dairy market, 2.3% of the egg market, and 2.1% of the poultry market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524159">The Liberals and Conservatives, who boast about being the great defenders of our farmers and supply management, just voted in favour of time allocation in order to pass this bill quickly. Last spring, they tried to have a motion adopted unanimously to pass the bill immediately. Obviously, we were there and voted against the motion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524160">There is quite a disconnect between what they say and what they do. They say they want to defend supply management in its entirety, without any breaches. Now that there is a tangible case in front of them, they are changing their tune and cannot pass this new version of the TPP, with all its breaches, soon enough. That does not add up. There is a major lack of credibility here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524161">On that note, I would remind the House that whenever there is a by-election, big promises are made. During the by-election in Lac-Saint-Jean, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said, "We will not make any concessions when it comes to supply management." </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524162"> He said this about the TPP on October 19, 2017, in Saint-Félicien, as reported by the Journal de Montréal. I was there too, and I heard it. We were happy at the time, but we now know how much his word is worth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524163">Just before the last election, on October 4, 2015, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> gave an interview to Radio-Canada, which is still available online, in which he said that the Liberal government would not make any concessions on supply management in the TPP. There was even a unanimous motion passed on February 7, 2018. The motion stated:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5524165">My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="214017" Type="2">Mirabel</Affiliation> moved this motion, which passed unanimously. The two Liberal international trade ministers were in the House, and they agreed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524166">I remind members that we, as legislators and elected officials, are the government's boss. We asked the government, including all of the Liberals and all of the Conservatives, to ensure that there was no breach in supply management in the new version of the trans-Pacific partnership. We ended up with a significant breach nonetheless. I repeat that his word and his promise are worthless in my eyes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524167">I would remind members that we are talking about 3.25% for milk, 2.3% for eggs, and 2.1% for poultry. These are all supposedly protected by a quota system that is very costly for farmers. In total, to have a protected market, we are talking about approximately $33 billion in quotas, including $20 billion just for the dairy sector. That is not peanuts. We should respect that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524168">This is the current explanation for the breach. The Americans wanted concessions with respect to supply management. As they no longer want to be part of the new TPP, they are being enticed with concessions to come back to the table. So what do President Donald Trump and the Americans do? They say they do not want the new TPP, but they want these types of concessions in NAFTA renegotiations. Since we made them in the TPP, we can make them to the Americans, as well. That makes a breach in two agreements for our farmers, who are paying for absolutely nothing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524169">I will draw a parallel to NAFTA. On June 7, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> stated in a Radio-Canada article that if Donald Trump wants to attack supply management, there would be no NAFTA, that they would not sign NAFTA. Given that the government's credibility and the worth of its word have been seriously tainted, there may be some doubt about that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5524172">There is an election campaign underway in Quebec. All party leaders are asking that supply management remain intact in NAFTA. However, it seems that this is not as important given the comments made by Simon Beauchemin, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister's </Affiliation> advisor in NAFTA renegotiations, who wrote an open letter in La Presse calling for the abolition of supply management.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5524173">On that topic, last winter I asked him if he wanted to abolish supply management and how he planned to reimburse the $33 billion worth of quota once supply management is abolished. Farmers are borrowing from financial institutions to cover that. All he did was chortle at me before taking off.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524174">I would remind the House that back when the majority of seats in Quebec were held by Bloc Québécois members, supply management was respected, and those sectors were automatically excluded from the 10 trade agreements signed by Canada, including NAFTA.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524175">At the time, Quebec had more of a voice and Canada listened. Since 2011, that has no longer been the case. Consider the Canada-EU agreement. The bargaining chip that Canada gave up was a new breach for the dairy and cheese sector. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524176">The Harper government had not only promised but even budgeted $4.3 billion in compensation for our dairy producers. The Liberals came to power and tore up that agreement, and instead created a mini program worth $250 million. The first part was gone in a matter of minutes. It was heavily criticized and not suited to our farmers. That is unacceptable. Our farmers were used as a bargaining chip in the Canada-EU agreement. The same thing happened with the TPP and now the CPTPP. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524177">The government has not announced any compensation for our farmers. Once again, farmers are being used as bargaining chips. We are worried about the NAFTA renegotiation because the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="229209" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> have changed their tune. We get silence, or they talk around the issue. We have real concerns that there could be another breach in supply management.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524178">This is in addition to all of the tricks, which I consider illegal, that American producers use to try to break into our market and that take an awful lot of time to address. I am talking about milk proteins, diafiltered milk, and misuse of the duty deferral program. There is also the spent fowl scandal, or the distributors that throw in a couple packets of sauce to bring in chicken wings and bypass supply management. Another example is how pizza kits are used bring in grated cheese, and I could go on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524179">Up until 2011, the government made its position clear to other countries. If they wanted us to make changes to supply management, they would have to eliminate their subsidies and other protectionist mechanisms. That used to be a prerequisite for negotiation, but not anymore. The government gave an inch, and now it is open season.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524180">A C.D. Howe Institute study showed that, in its first year, the TPP's impact on the GDP would be 0.01%. That is negligible. Any benefit will go mainly to Ontario and the west. Quebec is too far from the Pacific nations to benefit much at all. Nevertheless, the things Canada gave up in order to join the partnership are things that matter to Quebec. That is deplorable and unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524181">The supply management system works. The United States has a number of protected sectors such as cotton and sugar, but also dairy, eggs and poultry, same as here. All of the agreements that have been signed include very high tariffs to protect domestic markets. Most, if not all, industrialized nations have mechanisms to protect agriculture. Agriculture is an important sector, one vital to any country's national security and to feeding its people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524182">Apparently Canada's government is the only one prepared to sell out its farmers time after time. That is unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524183">We do not want to see the kinds of megafarms that have been popping up in the United States in recent years. Some of those farms have 10,000 cows. Megafarms account for 30% of milk production. Here, farms typically have about 50 cows. I am talking about a family farm land use model. If we did things here like they do in the United States, my entire riding would have a single producer. That is unacceptable, and we want nothing to do with it. An American magazine called Quartz reported that the suicide rate on American family farms is one a week.</ParaText>

Before the TPP, there was talk of negotiating an agreement with Japan. If we add that to the list of countries with which we already had an agreement, we would not be far from 100%. Every agreement already included a cultural exemption, so I hope that the government is not going back on that. That would be the last straw, because the government is already going back on supply management.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524190">What is more, since we already had agreements, this one does not really benefit the middle class and Quebec businesses. So says the C.D. Howe Institute.

It is a clear setback for Quebec since our farmers are being sacrificed for next to nothing in return.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5524207">The trans-Pacific partnership agreement has had a convoluted and somewhat rocky road. I think we would all admit that. I would like to take a bit of time to go through its history and then take as much time as possible, given that it is abbreviated now that we are down to only 10-minute speaking segments and time allocation has already been applied, on why it is completely anti-democratic to have investor-state provisions included in agreements, particularly the one currently before us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524208">I would like to adopt and support the submissions of the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214139" Type="2">Essex</Affiliation>. The trade critic for the New Democratic Party has put forward clear arguments. So has the MP for <Affiliation DbId="213868" Type="2">Vancouver Kingsway</Affiliation>. I agree with all I have heard from them. This allows me to concentrate on investor-state provisions rather than delve into the different sector-by-sector problems with the TPP. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524209">Going back to where it started, the TPP was well under way in negotiation under the previous Conservative government of Stephen Harper. It knew the TPP was under way and Canada did not have a seat at the table. Therefore, there are a number of reasons the agreement is lopsided against certain Canadian sectors. It has to do with the fact we joined late. We were aggressive with trying to be in. Some will remember that even during the 2015 election, when a government is supposed to have no more than a caretaker role, the former minister of trade was working hard to try to get this deal done. That was inappropriate, given that the writ had already dropped, but he certainly did work hard to achieve the TPP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524210">We know that the incoming U.S. president pulled out. That had a very substantial impact on the economic reach of the agreement. With the U.S. out, it looked like the TPP was dead. However, bad trade deals never die, they rise again, and this one came back without the United States and now with 11 countries in the trade pact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524211"> It is important for Canadians to know that we already have trade agreements, within NAFTA, with Mexico. Therefore, that means we are agreeing to new agreements with nine new nations. When we talk about the Pacific region, I think a lot of Canadians would assume this includes the big economic players. When we hear TPP, the trans-Pacific partnership, or now as it is styled, the comprehensive and progressive TPP, or CPTPP, one would assume it would include China and Indonesia. However, large economic players in Asia are out of the agreement, other than the big one, which are Japan, as well as Malaysia, and of course Australia and New Zealand. There are smaller economic countries, such as Peru and Vietnam, as well as Singapore, which is significant but relatively small in terms of trade.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524212">We have a cobbled together agreement that we now are rushing to pass. We were promised that we would not rush through trade deals in this place, that we would have full debate. I gather the committee has been told that it has to rush as well. Therefore, this trade agreement will not be adequately debated. That is now a foregone conclusion because of time allocation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524213">In the six and a half minutes remaining to me, let me explain why I submit to the House that investor-state dispute resolution sections do not belong in any agreement. They do not belong in trade agreements. They in fact have nothing to do with trade. They are often conflated and confused with trade dispute resolution agreements. Therefore, in the case of NAFTA, which, by the way, was the source of these investor dispute resolution systems, chapter 11 in NAFTA had never been requested before. They were not understood. They were not even understood by the people who negotiated NAFTA. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524214">What we have under NAFTA is chapter 19, which deals with how one sorts out disputes over tariffs and unfair trade decision. We are used to those. That is appropriately a trade dispute resolution provision. One needs those if one has a trade deal. What we do not need is this bogus, anti-democratic investor-state provision, which arose in chapter 11 of NAFTA. What does it mean? On paper, when people first read NAFTA, including in all the fights over adopting NAFTA, none of the anti-NAFTA groups ever noticed chapter 11. No one talked about it; it was a sleeper.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="30">(1330)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5524215">What chapter 11 seemed to say was common sense. If someone had invested in a country and the asset that was built was expropriated, such as when Fidel Castro took over Cuba, the expropriation of assets would require compensation, which is the international norm already. It looked like chapter 11 was about that. We found out that was not what the chapter was capable of doing in the Ethyl Corporation case, when Ethyl Corporation of Richmond, Virginia brought the first chapter 11 case against Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524216"> It should be noted that as of now, Canada is the most sued industrialized country under these investor-state agreements and we have lost repeatedly. We have lost, but it was not as if we did something that was a subversion of our trade, not as if we treated some country that we promised we would give it friendly treatment and it was a duplicitous action in pursuit of a trade benefit. No, we have lost when we were trying to protect public health and the environment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524217">Let us look at Ethyl Corporation. In that instance, the former minister of environment, Sheila Copps, heard of the efforts of groups like the one I was executive director of, Sierra Club Canada. We worked hard to get rid of a toxic gasoline additive called MMT, which is manganese based. We were joined in that effort, believe it or not, by the car makers. The car makers said that MMT gunked up the engines and compromised the catalytic converters. In other words, it increased pollution in a way that could void their warranties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524218"> Therefore, the auto manufacturers, the environmental groups and a number of health groups, with evidence from neurotoxicologist Dr. Donna Mergler of the University of Quebec in Montreal, said that this stuff increased manganism in the human population, in other words tremors that looked a lot like Parkinson's, and at the same time threatened to void the warranties of cars. The minister of the environment brought forward a law which was passed in Parliament. The law said that we would get rid of MMT in gasoline. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524219">It is important to know that at this point the United States Environmental Protection Agency had refused to register MMT, because its advice was that this stuff was bad for the environment, bad for human health and we should not use it. Therefore, Canada banned it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524220">Ethyl Corporation said that it was going to chapter 11 of NAFTA. However, before that chapter 11 case was through, the government of the day decided to settle, and we cannot say “out of court” because there are no courts involved here. These are private arbitration matters generally heard in hotel rooms. Therefore, if we are going to call a chapter 11 arbitration “out of court”, we have to insert the word “kangaroo” before the word “court” so the whole thing makes sense. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524221">However, Ethyl Corporation got out of Canada an award of $13 million U.S., which was taken out of the A-base budget of Environment Canada. If members do not think that had a chilling affect on Environment Canada's willingness to ban dangerous chemicals that were made in the United States, then they are not looking at the facts of what has happened since then. That was the first one. By the way, what was Ethyl Corporation's investment in Canada? Did it have a plant here? No. Did it create jobs here? No. It was selling the toxic gasoline additive here, and that was enough to make it an investor. The same thing happened with S.D. Myers, which was the next case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524222">S.D. Myers is an Ohio-based company that runs incinerators for PCB contaminated waste. Sheila Copps, former minister of environment, banned the export of PCB contaminated waste from Canada consistent with the Basel Convention to which Canada was a signatory, but S.D. Myers sued. Guess what. It was suddenly an investor. It had expected profit from taking Canadian PCB waste and burning it in Ohio. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524223">However, when we banned the export of PCB contaminated waste from Canada, the import of PCB contaminated waste into the U.S. was illegal under U.S. law. On that set of facts, we could not imagine that we would lose, but we lost. Canada appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal, which said that it was not significant enough of an egregious error under the rules of arbitration for us to win, and so we had to pay S.D. Myers money. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524224">We are now awaiting Bilcon, which has asked for $580 million in damages. Canada has lost in Federal Court in our efforts to defend the good decision of a very ethical, thorough, independent, thoroughly evidence-based finding of the environmental assessment panel on Bilcon's efforts to do an open-pit quarry in Digby, Nova Scotia. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524225">Ethyl Corporation did not go to the courts in Canada, which it could have done. By the way, that decision led to the Progressive Conservative government of Nova Scotia turning down the permit and the previous Conservative Government of Canada environment minister John Baird turning down the permit. However, Bilcon, in New Jersey, went to a secret hearing under chapter 11 of NAFTA and it won.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5524226">TPP does not have such egregious secrecy; that is the one area in which this is different. However, we pass this and we will regret it. We will have chapter 9 suits under TPP, again from Malaysia and from Japan, and we will lose because Canada generally loses. This is corrosive to democracy, and I urge us to take investor state out of the bill in front of us.</ParaText>

I would also suggest that the World Trade Organization does not insist on investor-state dispute resolution agreements; the protection of foreign corporations to protect their expectation of profits is outside the WTO. There was an attempt to put it inside in the multilateral agreement on investment, which was rejected within the OECD. Therefore, these are independent of WTO rules. </ParaText>

We should rethink them, renegotiate them and ensure that only in the case of a foreign government's seizing actual assets would we have the reason to be able to say it owes us money. We should never owe a foreign corporation money for protecting the environment in Canada, protecting jobs in Canada and protecting labour rights in Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5524231">Mr. Speaker, this is a regular line by the left and the Green Party in Canada, to suggest that these international dispute mechanisms are somehow sinister. As a lawyer in Ontario I know, and as the hon. member is a lawyer as well she would know, that a lot of regimes have mandatory mediation processes and a number of elements to take disputes out of a long-winded laborious litigation process. Therefore, in a lot of these agreements, there are agreements for disputes to be settled in a specific way. That is what contracts are for: certainty, particularly when countries have different legal standards, whether civil code or common law, and some countries do not respect the rule of law. That type of certainty is what investors expect. That is what companies expect. That is what states expect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524232">I would love the hon. member to suggest for this House that it is somehow sinister in an agreement premised upon certainty to not allow parties to have choice of forum, choice of law. These are fundamental aspects of contract law. I hate how this sort of spectre of ISDS or mandatory disputes or the disputes mechanism we set up with China is somehow sinister, when it is actually meant to overcome uncertainty and incompatibility of legal systems. Does the hon. member not suggest that companies, governments and people have the ability to forge these decisions, whether it is ISDS or other mechanisms?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5524234">I am very grateful to my hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="214489" Type="2">Courtenay—Alberni</Affiliation> for referencing the concerns of Brenda Sayers from the Hupacasath First Nation.

              <ParaText id="5524236">Mr. Speaker, it is great to be back, to be able to speak on Bill <Document DbId="9970461" Type="3">C-79</Document> and, in particular, to be able to speak to trade.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524237">I believe trade is part of Canada's DNA, from our beginnings with the fur trade to today, where we are a leader globally when it comes to mining, minerals and exploration. We can look at all the other sectors, be it agriculture, manufacturing, innovation and tech, and Canada is a leader.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524238">I want to leave a statistic with the Chamber that really highlights how important trade is to Canada and how great a job we do at trade globally. We are 0.5% of Canada's population, but we do 2.5% of all global trade, five times our population. That just shows, globally, that we are a trading nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524239">We look at CETA, where we were able to sign that agreement and open up another market of over 500 million people and over $20 trillion GDP in that market. Now, we look at the CPTPP and we look to Asia as another opportunity for Canada to be able to trade our great goods and services, a market of about 500 million people and $13.5 trillion GDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524240">We are able to now talk about some of the benefits we will be able to experience from CPTPP if we were to sign on. Looking at our industrial and manufacturing sectors, located right in Mississauga East—Cooksville, we have Maple Leaf, a great company. They do a great deal of export. Having these tariffs stripped away from many of the countries in Asia that are part of the CPTPP that they work with will mean more jobs here in Canada and will give us greater market access.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524241">I have heard from my constituents and the businesses in my area that this is the way forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524242">Mississauga is Canada's sixth-largest city and we continue to grow, mostly through companies that are export oriented. Those export-oriented companies are producing the best jobs. Whether it be automobiles or medical devices, metals, chemicals or plastics, they are all essential components to our national economy, employing 1.7 million full-time and highly skilled Canadians, and contributing close to 11% of Canada's GDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524243">Our government firmly believes that the CPTPP is the ideal agreement for Canadians and our economy. This is a high-level trade agreement that will increase Canadian exports and help us to succeed in foreign markets as a cornerstone of our government's comprehensive efforts to enhance Canada's engagement with dynamic, fast-growing and increasingly influential Asian markets. It is an important part of our commitment to diversify trade, grow our economy and strengthen our country's middle class.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524244"> Trade and investment flows between Canada and Asian economies have increased significantly since the turn of the century. From 2014 to 2016, Canada's exports of industrial and manufactured goods to the CPTPP countries accounted for an annual average of $22.4 billion. By eliminating now nearly 100% tariffs on manufactured goods, including some tariffs that are as high as 85%, a high barrier, and creating mechanisms to address non-tariff barriers to trade, the CPTPP will create opportunities for world-class Canadian businesses to increase their sales.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524245">Once the agreement enters into force, it will enable Canadian exporters to access diverse and internationally integrated value chains. On day one of the agreement coming into force, there will be no tariffs on over 87% of industrial tariff lines, covering Canada's exports to CPTPP markets, worth an annual average of close to $20 billion over a two-year period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524246">What will this mean for individual industries? Allow me to provide just a few examples for Canada's multi-billion dollar chemicals and plastics industry.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5524247"> The CPTPP will provide opportunities for companies in Ontario, the hub of Canada's plastics industry, to cutting-edge mechanical facilities in Alberta with improved market access. This industry will improve its annual average of $1.1 billion in exports to the CPTPP countries by eliminating tariffs that are as high as 50%. What a difference that will make in our exports of plastics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524248">With respect to metals and minerals, a sector contributing nearly 600,000 jobs here in Canada and exporting $5 billion in goods to CPTPP markets, the agreement would result in the elimination of all tariffs, again some as high as 50%. As a result, highly sought-after Canadian aluminum, steel, iron, petroleum products and precious metals will become even more competitive in such markets as Japan, Australia, Malaysia and Vietnam. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524249">Canada's information and communication technologies sector, critical to major urban centres across Canada, is also well positioned under this agreement to meet growing needs within established and developed markets in the Asia-Pacific. In addition to eliminating tariffs, the agreement will protect companies from having to divulge their proprietary information in order to sell their products in these markets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524250">In the auto sector, our government listened, and listened a lot, to what Canadians had to say and made their concerns a priority. As part of the negotiations, Canada has obtained bilateral cover letters from Australia and Malaysia to establish more liberal rules of origin, which will allow our automotive manufacturers to take advantage of the preferential tariff treatment in these markets without having to adjust their current production models.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524251">We also achieved bilateral results with Japan and Malaysia on standards and regulations in the automotive sector, a key demand from industry stakeholders as these non-tariff barriers were impeding our export abilities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524252">These are just a few examples of areas that could benefit from the CPTPP. By making Canadian industrial and manufacturing exports more competitive, reducing the red tape that impedes access to dynamic and growing markets, this agreement would provide Canadian businesses with significant opportunities to increase profits and create new jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524253">Beyond tariff reduction, another aspect of the CPTPP that stands to benefit Canadian companies in these sectors is the area of intellectual property. The agreement's provisions on intellectual property cover virtually all areas regarding trade and IP, including copyright, patents, trademarks, geographical indication, industrial designs, domain names and enforcement. Most importantly, the protection and enforcement of IP rights will help protect Canadian innovation and investment as our businesses trade abroad. For Canadian businesses, one of the most significant barriers to trade in some markets is uncertainty over the protection of intellectual property, including whether their intellectual property rights will be respected and enforced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524254">Intellectual property is valuable property and this agreement establishes a clear and predictable standard on IP rights and enforcement in the Asia-Pacific region. This will allow Canadian creators, innovators and investors to conduct trade with our new CPTPP partners with the assurance that their products will be protected while benefiting from the same rules as other parties within this agreement. In turn, this will encourage investment in innovative technologies in Canada and allow Canadians to develop and market their brands in the region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524255">As a result, innovative Canadian companies will be better positioned to commercialize their products in both established and fast-growing Asian markets. In addition to tariff reduction and IP rules, the agreement also addresses costly and time-consuming non-tariff barriers that make it difficult for Canadian companies to enter these foreign markets. Commitments by CPTPP members to cut away that burdensome and restrictive regulatory red tape in such sectors as cosmetics, medical devices, pharmaceuticals and ICT will provide Canadian manufacturing exporters with greater certainty and predictability that the competitive benefits their products receive from tariff elimination will be fully realized.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524256">By establishing an effective and transparent rules-based trade system in one of the world's most dynamic and growing regions, the CPTPP will lay the groundwork for exporters in our industrial and manufacturing sectors to take advantage of these opportunities. This is why I am encouraging all of my hon. colleagues to support Bill <Document DbId="9970461" Type="3">C-79</Document> and allow for the swift implementation of this important agreement.</ParaText>

We have companies like Maple Leaf, which deal with agriculture and selling many of their products to many of the CPTPP countries, and also those in the manufacturing supply chain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524265"> I know many manufacturers in my riding produce some of the products and machinery that help with mining. Many of those machines are then exported around the world to be able to do the work in various countries. This means jobs for my riding and for the ridings of all the members in this chamber. These are good, well-paying jobs. We know that export-oriented companies have some of the highest-paying jobs in our country, and that is why we have to double down on exporting and looking at diversifying our markets. This is a very important agreement in terms of enabling us to do that, to be able to reach into some emerging economies and also to have a better agreement with some very established countries like Japan, where we have a tremendous opportunity to do a great deal more business.</ParaText>

Yes, there are some sectors that had very serious concerns about ISDS. However, there were also other sectors, like financial services, the minerals industry and mining, which need to have these provisions in place to be 100% able with certainty, stability and assurances to invest in these countries and provide great-paying jobs here in Canada. These countries needed to have those assurances through an ISDS system that would work for them so those investments could be made. We want to ensure those precious Canadian dollars being invested in other parts of the world will be secure. </ParaText>

Despite how busy he was, he always made time for family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524281">Bob was a strong voice for farmers, speaking his mind, voting his conscience and pushing for common sense changes. He fought U.S. trade barriers. He stood up for law-abiding gun owners, and he always put the safety of Canadians first. He was a friend who offered encouragement and guidance to me as a new MP.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5524287">Mr. Speaker, last evening I was made aware of the latest reprehensible action by the government against the charter rights of Canadian Abousfian Abdelrazik.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524288">Mr. Abdelrazik was in Sudan in 2003 visiting his ailing mother when he was arrested by that country's notorious security service. A 2009 Federal Court judgment revealed that CSIS was complicit in his arrest and subsequent prolonged and unlawful detention and torture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524289">Finally released, Canada refused him a passport so that he could return to Canada, yet Mr. Abdelrazik was never charged or convicted of any offence. He required a Federal Court order based on a violation of his constitutionally guaranteed right to mobility to finally reunite with his family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524290">He filed a lawsuit exercising his right to compensation for violation of his charter rights. Nine years later and on the eve of his court hearing, the government, which claims to defend charter rights, moved to have the trial adjourned indefinitely.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524291">Three successive governments have been complicit in these violations. I call on the government to end its obstructive tactics and provide Mr. Abdelrazik with the redress that is his basic right.</ParaText>

In the past four years use among adults has doubled and use among youth has increased by 50%.

If he takes into account the Canada child benefit, what one can see is that Canadian families, average middle-class families in 2019, will be $2,000 better off than they were in 2015.

              <ParaText id="5524535">Mr. Speaker, it is always a deep privilege for me to represent Durham. At this the start of the fall session, it is great to be able to speak on the subject of trade, something I worked on as parliamentary secretary to the great member for <Affiliation DbId="214072" Type="2">Abbotsford</Affiliation>, probably our best international trade minister in the history of this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524536">It is also great giving my first speech after our caucus having grown yesterday. I am very proud that the member for <Affiliation DbId="214352" Type="2">Aurora—Oak Ridges—Richmond Hill</Affiliation> brings perspective on trade to our caucus that was lost in the government's side, not realizing that trade and security go deeply together. I will keep that in mind in the context of remarks on the comprehensive and progressive agreement for the trans-Pacific partnership, really the TPP-11. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524537">In large part, most of the heavy lifting done on the trans-Pacific partnership deal was done by the Conservative government. Members may realize that during the 2015 election, all the parties, and there were 12 at that time, and the United States had come to an agreement. It was quite unusual for that to happen. However, unlike what the leader of the Green Party suggested, when there is an international agreement like that, we cannot ask them to wait until our election is over. We got the deal done in a way that did not pit one industry over another, in a way that Canada was at the table for jobs, not for posturing, not for virtue signalling, not for domestic politics. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Liberal Party actually use trade to advance their social agenda for their electorate in Canada while putting hundreds of thousands of jobs on the line. Of the many failures of the government highlighted in its #SummerOfFailure, perhaps the biggest risk it is playing with our economy is what it is doing on our trade agreements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524538">In the last few years, we have seen countries like Australia, New Zealand, Japan, the Philippines, India—of course the whole world knows about that trip—China, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and the United States all frustrated with Canada. </ParaText>

                <B>Hon. Erin O'Toole:</B> There is Italy as well. Members are welcome to heckle by yelling out more countries because they are hard to keep track of. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524541">However, we are here to talk about the trans-Pacific partnership, TPP-11, because this represents Canada's reassertion of our role as a Pacific nation and the fact that in the last 50 years the Pacific has generated as much wealth than in the previous 100 years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524542">I had the honour as parliamentary secretary to go on the ground along with Senator Yonah Martin and Barry Devolin, the former MP for Kawartha Lakes, to help secure the final stages of our free trade agreement with South Korea. Now, it is not part of the TPP, but that was our first free trade agreement in Asia. It recognizes that Canada is a Pacific nation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524543">As the middle class grows in Asia, it is demanding the world's best agricultural products from our country: beef, pork, grain and oil seeds. We are world leaders and Canada is trusted for our high-quality product. My riding's name is Durham, but when world agriculture thinks of durum, it does not think of my riding. It thinks of the wheat developed in Canada. We have been innovators, and our farming families are some of our most committed Canadians to our economy. These trade deals from South Korea to TPP recognize that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524544">The trans-Pacific partnership with the 11 countries represents almost 500 million consumers. Let us see the wealth that is developed there. China has gone from a country that was considered impoverished 40 years or 50 years ago to being a world-leading economy, the number two economy. I was shocked by the fact that following the Korean War, in which over 500 Canadians died serving and which forged our relationship with that important Asian friend and country, South Korea was one of the largest recipients of food aid. The actions of Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and our allies has led to prosperity in that country through security and trade and today it is one of the largest net donors to food aid around the world. In 50 years to 60 years, it is remarkable to go from one of the most impoverished to one of the most successful countries, as well as an ally we can count on.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="15">(1515)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5524545">That is what trade can do. That is what working on trade and security together can do. That is why the member for <Affiliation DbId="214352" Type="2">Aurora—Oak Ridges—Richmond Hill</Affiliation>, after three years of banging her head against the wall in a government that is about platitudes and photographs of its leader, of neglecting our trade relationships or insulting our foreign allies and friends, and of withering away the prosperity that Canada enjoys, is sitting on this side.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524546">With TPP we have the ability to access a combined GDP in these countries of almost $14 trillion. As I said at the outset, under the Harper government, many of our trade deals were centred around the importance of our agricultural sectors and industries. This is going to be part of the case. As I said, this will have us accessing markets that are growing, the prosperity that is growing in Vietnam, for example, one of the countries, and in Japan, the world's third-largest economy. They have a high demand for our pork, beef and grains. They are going to see tariff rates reduced. In 10 to 15 years, all tariffs will be reduced off of pork and beef, for instance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524547">If members go to Seoul, like I did, they will try Korean barbecue. Koreans love pork and beef, and they prefer that it be Canadian. By getting in there when we did, we were able to compete on an even playing ground with Australia and the United States. Our product always wins. We just need fair access.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524548">Wheat and barley will see tariff reductions almost immediately, and canola will see reductions within five years. There will be huge wins for our agricultural sectors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524549">Representing part of Oshawa, and being the son of someone who worked more than 33 years at General Motors, there have been some concerns on auto. I would refer some of the people who have these concerns to the fact that we have a global supply chain for the auto industry. In fact, the globalization of the auto industry started with Canada and the U.S., with the Auto Pact in 1965, where a vehicle rolling off the line in Oshawa was treated as domestic and tariff-free if sold in the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524550">Since then, since the 1960s, 80% of the vehicles we have assembled in Canada have been sold in the United States, yet the minister did not even mention the auto industry in the NAFTA priority speeches. In fact, the Liberals took six months to put proposals forward on auto. That was a huge failure, and six months were squandered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524551">Diversification and the trans-Pacific partnership are making sure that our auto parts suppliers and auto companies are competitive and have access to those markets. If there is going to be capital investment and Mexico, our NAFTA partner, is part of the trans-Pacific partnership and we are not, where do members think more investment from global automakers, from auto parts companies will go? It will go to the country that has the best access tariff-free around the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524552">We need to be at the table. Forty-five per cent of the vehicles made within the TPP countries, the 11 countries, need to be assembled by the member countries, one of those 11 countries. We need to be part of that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5524561">She knows the former member for her riding, the late Jim Flaherty, worked closely with Stephen Harper to save the auto industry in Canada. It was a tough time, and for Conservatives it was a tough decision, but it was a temporary measure to make sure that GM and Chrysler survived, because the hundreds of thousands of jobs that trickle out to the auto parts industry are critical. These are important jobs, whether it is auto plant workers or GM retirees in Whitby, in Oshawa, or in Durham. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524562">As I said at the outset, since 1965, we have always produced export, mainly to the United States, but we started a very serious diversification effort under the last Conservative government. It is very good that was done now that we have President Trump in the United States, who is protectionist. We will continue to do that. </ParaText>

However, unfortunately in the field they are not listening to the auto sector itself, which is saying not to sign the CPTPP because it will harm jobs in Canada. This is not me as the member for Essex or the NDP who are asking this; it is actually the people they are claiming to represent. If they are not listening to those in the exact sector they represent, to those whose jobs will be lost in their community, then I do not know how they have the nerve to stand in the House and talk about auto in a way that says they are representing it. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5524570">Madam Speaker, what a privilege and pleasure it is to rise on such an important issue as international trade. I have been listening to the debate, both yesterday and today, without too many surprises. I recognize and appreciate very much the Conservative Party's position with respect to supporting the government and recognizing the importance of passing this legislation by supporting the time allocation motion that was brought forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524571">I am not surprised that the NDP have continued to fight anything to do with trade agreements, and I will try to provide some further comment on that. However, as we have heard a lot about details, numbers, and so forth, I would first like to highlight what I believe is important for this House, the viewers, and the people who might be following the debate to recognize. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524572">Since day one, it has been this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s number one goal and objective to fight for Canada's middle class and those aspiring to be a part of it. I would suggest that looking at the world markets and the potential they have for Canada with respect to increasing our quality of life and number of jobs is something we cannot work hard enough to achieve, because of the type of potential that is there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524573"> I believe we could do so much more, and we have a government that is committed to doing more. Since day one, ministers have put the trade file front and centre as we try to ensure we are creating opportunities while working with Canadians, business, stakeholders, labour and so forth to enhance the opportunities abroad. The bottom line is that it is working.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524574">Throughout these discussions and debates over the last two and a half years, we have seen a lot of agreements signed. Many Canadians might not be aware of how many countries are involved with the EU trade agreement in particular. There are some 25 plus countries, plus Ukraine, plus legislation dealing with the World Trade Organization. All those agreements and all those sign-offs that have occurred during this administration, along with the support from many other initiatives, have led to the generation of over a half million additional jobs in the Canadian economy today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524575">We are very fortunate and blessed to have such a skilled workforce. As has been pointed out by some in this House, whether it is the automobile industry or the agriculture industry, we have the best workers in the world. I believe the CPTPP is an agreement that will secure markets into the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524576">Whenever I have the opportunity to talk trade with constituents, I try to explain how I see trade from my perspective. I see it as something that is absolutely critical to Canada's middle class, and I will attempt to try to explain it in the best way I know. At the end of the day, trade provides employment in a very tangible way, and I would like to give a couple of examples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524577">About 18 months ago I had an opportunity to go out to Neepawa, Manitoba. HyLife Foods LP is there, which produces pork. At that time, at least 95% of all the pork leaving the plant was going abroad, to Asia. That is a significant amount of pork. To put it in terms of jobs, we are talking about hundreds, not dozens, of direct jobs in the relatively small but beautiful community of Neepawa. That's just the direct jobs, those individuals who show up on the plant floor every day, and it is a market that is growing.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="30">(1530)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5524578">After we look at those direct jobs, we have to think about the indirect jobs. Those hundreds of employees are consumers of automobiles, housing and food. They are engaged in the communities. They are adding to the social fibre of that particular community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524579">Let us think about it in the sense that if not for those workers and their contribution to Manitoba's or Neepawa's or indeed Canada's economy, we would have lost a significant portion of Canada's overall GDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524580">The example I am giving of Neepawa is taking place all over our country. These jobs are critically important. If not for trade, we would not have those jobs. Canada is a trading nation. We need to have markets abroad. This is a significant agreement; we are talking about over 500 million additional consumers. We are talking about a significant number of people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524581">When we can assist, by securing markets and by having something on paper, that is a positive thing for communities like Neepawa, and for businesses like HyLife that want to be able to continue to expand and employ more individuals. There are not only those direct jobs, but also those indirect jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524582">That was around 18 months ago, and I might be off by a month or two. I would think all members of Parliament would be familiar with a company called Canada Goose. Canada Goose is a world-class business that exports winter apparel, the best in the world. I think they now have three factories established. I am very glad that the latest addition to the Canada Goose family is in the heart of Winnipeg North, the area I represent. There will be hundreds of additional jobs as a direct result of that expansion. I think it is around 700, but I am not 100% sure on the actual numbers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524583">Here we have a first-class, world-quality product that is being manufactured in Canada and is employing hundreds of people. They too need those export markets. Those export markets are what allow companies such as HyLife and Canada Goose to look to the future and see ongoing growth. To me, that is what world trade is really all about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524584">As legislators, we should not be fearful of trade. This is where we differ from New Democrats. I listen. I have listened to many speeches from New Democrats on trade. They do not support trade. If it was up to the NDP, we would still have hundreds of horse-drawn buggies being manufactured in Canada. They just do not want to advance the economy. They do not seem to understand that the world is changing. Technology causes change. There are jobs that will be generated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524585">The proof is in the pudding. We have a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, a cabinet, and Liberal government members who are saying we believe in Canadians and we want to invest in Canada, whether it is through infrastructure or social programming. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524586">At the end of the day, we understand that if strength is added to Canada's middle class, we are really allowing the economy to be healthier and stronger. When we have a healthy, educated citizenship, and as we move and strive to improve upon that, we will see that our companies here in Canada are the best in the world. All we have to do is ensure that we get them the markets, and we will continue to prosper well into the future.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5524610">Back in July, it was our leader, the leader of Her Majesty's loyal opposition, who wrote to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> strongly encouraging him to bring back Parliament during the summer so that we could work here to get the bill passed so that all Canadians could enjoy the benefits of this important trade deal.

              <ParaText id="5524613">The very first statement I made in the House, the very first issue I raised in the House in response to the Speech from the Throne, was to encourage the government to ratify the trans-Pacific partnership at the absolute earliest convenience. The government did not do it at the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524614">Why is the trans-Pacific partnership important now? We are currently living in an uncertain trading situation. We as Canadians have enjoyed a long and important trading relationship with our friends south of the border. Twenty per cent of our GDP is linked to our trading relationship with our friends in the United States. This year alone, from January to July, $252 billion of our exports went to the United States, representing approximately 75% of our nation's outputs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524615">Over the summer, like many of my Conservative colleagues, I spoke to many local businesses in my and neighbouring ridings to hear their concerns. The businesses and the people I spoke with are concerned. They are concerned about what tariffs are doing to their businesses. They are concerned about how the costs of the tariffs on steel and aluminum are affecting how they do business. They are concerned about how those costs are being passed on to their consumers and the challenges they are having in negotiating with their suppliers and the terms they are getting with their suppliers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524616">It is a concern that I hear from small businesses, from farmers and from farm families. I hear it from those in the supply managed sector and those in non-supply managed commodities. My constituents and Canadians across this country are concerned about the uncertainty in the Canada-U.S. relationship and with NAFTA. This is why more than ever we need to be diversifying our markets, which is why when our Conservative government was in office those 53 countries were essential to that progress and why it is now important that we must ratify the CPTPP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524617">The 11 countries that make up the CPTPP account for a $10 trillion contribution to the global economy, or approximately 13% of the global economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524618">As a country, Canada must be one of the first six to ratify this deal so that we can enjoy the benefits of the first-mover countries. We need those benefits. Our farmers, our farm families, our manufacturers, our exporters, our small businesses need to be able to enjoy the benefits associated with the trans-Pacific partnership.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5524619">What are some of those benefits? One example is that Australia will eliminate all of its tariffs on agriculture and agri-food products upon the agreement's coming into force, except for one tariff line, which will be eliminated within four years. Some have asked me what that one tariff line is. It is bamboo shoots. For those Canadians who are currently growing bamboo shoots, they will have to wait four years for that to come into force, but I am sure that Canada will have a strong bamboo economy within four years for exports to Australia. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524620">In Perth—Wellington, there is a strong pork industry, a strong beef industry and certainly a strong grains and oil seeds industry. Japan's tariffs are currently up to 20% on pork products, including sausages, and will be eliminated within 10 years. Vietnam has tariffs of up to 27%, which will be eliminated within nine years. For beef, Japanese tariffs of up to 38.5% will be reduced to 9% within 15 years. In Vietnam, tariffs of up to 31% on fresh and chilled frozen beef will be eliminated within two years and tariffs of up to 34% on all other beef products will be eliminated within seven years.</ParaText>

We will also have access to CPTPP-wide quota for food barley, which starts at 25,000 tonnes and grows to 65,000 tonnes within eight years. These are the kinds of benefits that Canadian farmers, farm families and exporters can enjoy with an implemented trans-Pacific partnership.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5524642">Madam Speaker, it is great to be talking about trade and TPP, or CPTPP. I call it TPP because it is just easier. Actually, that is really what it is: an agreement that we, the Conservatives, developed, worked on and prepared a letter of intent. We gave it to the Liberals with a bow tied around it, and three years later we are actually going through the process of ratifying it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524643">I want to give a little history on TPP, exactly how it came about and what the intent was behind it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524644"> If we go back a few years to 2014 and 2015, like-minded countries came together and said that rules needed to be created in the Asia-Pacific region that all countries would follow. It was a way to ensure proper rules were in place so countries like China and India would not bully other smaller economies in that region. This was a chance to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524645">The other thing that was happening was the chance to modernize NAFTA. Canada, the U.S. and Mexico were all part of the original TPP. They were saying that we could take this, add clients in North America, and this would replace and modernize NAFTA. In fact, if we would have done that, we would not be in this quagmire we are today and we would not have this insecurity in our business community. If the Liberals would have taken the TPP in 2015 when they were elected, instead of stalling and delaying, had embraced it with Obama and put it through, we would not be sitting here today talking about NAFTA and the concerns around it. It is frustrating for farmers, forestry workers and people in the mining and manufacturing sectors because it is three years later. They have been through a lot of stress and hardship in those three years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524646">This deal is great for Saskatchewan. It is great for our agriculture producers. They are the first to tell us that. They will have preferential access to markets in Japan. The fact that the U.S. is no longer involved makes it even better. Our beef producers can go into Japan with lower tariffs than our American competitors. Our grain growers can go into Japan and Asian markets with a competitive advantage over the Americans. The American farmers are fuming about this. They want to be part of this agreement also. However, because of their choices and their leadership, they are not part of this agreement. We are, so it is very important we are part of the first movers in this agreement to take full advantage of this opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524647">I was in Japan last January and had a chance to sit down with some of our trade commissioners there. They are great people. Whenever I travelled, I tried to ensure I had a day to talk to different trade commissioners and embassies about the challenges and opportunities Canadian businesses had in that part of the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524648"> The people in Japan are excited. They talk about forestry products, for example. Our forestry sector is doing relatively okay, but, again, it has this cloud of tariffs and lack of market access into the U.S. The Asian market is something new to these people of which they can really take advantage. Our trade commissioner is saying that there is a huge opportunity for them to sell lumber and lumber products into Japan. Again, having that tariff-free access into the market is going to benefit that sector and help pivot away from the U.S. It will provide more security and stability in those communities with lumber as their main occupation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524649">When we look at the beef producers, Japan has huge trading houses. They do not just trade in Japan; they trade all over Asia. When producers are selling to these trading houses, their product becomes part of the mix in components put out for sale in different areas in Asia. For example, if one is selling beef steaks to go into TV dinners, it will be Canadian beef going across Asia, through these Japanese trading houses, feeding people across Asia. That is an advantage our beef producers will have that our American producers across the line will not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524650">When we talk about the Japanese business community, it is very loyal. Once someone is involved with the Japanese, once a proper relationship has been established with them, it is almost for life. They want to deal with those people over and over again. All of a sudden price is not the biggest issue anymore. They want quality. They want things we can deliver out of Canada. That is the advantage of having that tariff-free access and being the first mover.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524651">That was why we needed to have this agreement come forward three years ago. It was why we should have had this agreement last spring. It is really disappointing that the Liberals would have rather done marijuana legislation than legislation that would have such a positive impact on our economy across Canada. At least we are here today. I give the government credit for making it the top priority, because we have to provide some stability for our business community and some new markets for them to sell into. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5524652">We have to remember that the Liberal government has not been very successful when it comes to trade files, when it comes to foreign policy. When the Liberals said that Canada was back, the reality is that years later we are not back. In fact, we are viewed as something other than what we were in the previous Harper government. This is a chance for us to go back into the marketplace, exert our great products and compete on a level playing field.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524653">When I had round tables this summer, I talked to many manufacturers and agricultural producers. One of the things they talked about was competitiveness. We need to have a debate in the House about competitiveness. We need to really understand what has happened to our sectors and the impact that regulations and taxation like carbon taxes has had on them and their ability to compete, not only in North America but around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524654">When we start imposing taxes and regulations in Canada that shut down our industries, those products are being replaced by products in other parts of the world that do not have the same regulations and taxes. Those products will not have the same environmental benefits we have in Canada. We should be selling more goods, building more things because our environmental standards are so high compared to other regions in the world. We should be exporting like crazy because it is better for the global environment if we do it here than in a third world country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524655"> However, the government wants to penalize our manufacturers and the different sectors. It views them as something bad, but they are our global strength. We should be embracing and working with them to ensure they have all the opportunities to sell their products and goods around the world, not beat them up. The government is doing nothing but beating them up, calling them tax cheats and all different kinds of names, undermining them through tax code changes and lack of consultations. Those things have to stop. Our business community cannot afford it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524656">When I talk to the business community, I am very scared. Businesses are not talking about expanding in Canada. Any thought of expansion in Canada is on hold. If they are going to expand, it is going to be in Tennessee or elsewhere in the U.S. where there are all sorts of incentives and tax breaks, an environment that actually wants their business, that wants them to grow there. We do not have that atmosphere in Canada anymore. We have an atmosphere where business is viewed as something that is evil. That is wrong and it has to change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524657">Hopefully the government will understand that by getting a trade agreement it opens up market access. That is really good. However, if we do not give our businesses, companies and farmers a level playing field through taxation and regulation, what good is it? They cannot compete because we have made them uncompetitive. Those are the issues we have to address. The Liberals cannot say that they passed the trade agreement, everything is good and go back and eat Cheerios. The trade agreement is just the first step. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524658">The Liberals need to go to work and help people open up markets. They need to use our trade commissioners and trade services to ensure they understand what markets are available to them. We have to ensure we have EDC and BDC in place to help them expand their operations in Canada to grow the market. We need to help them with business plans in areas where they do not understand how business is done. We have those professionals within the bureaucracy. We need to leverage those professionals and ensure they have the tools to do what they need to do. We have to ensure the business community understands that those tools are there and are available. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524659">This is a good agreement. It has some flaws. One of the biggest flaws is it should have been done three years ago. Having said that, at least we are doing it now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524660"> I want to compliment the Liberal government for at least doing it now. This is the right thing to do. I am glad it is doing it and I look forward to being part of the trade committee to see this move forward. I look forward to going back to my farmers and forestry workers and telling them that we do not know what is going on the in the U.S., that we are not sure what is happening with NAFTA because Liberals will not tell us, that they are secretive, but at least we have fair and good market access into Asia. They can put resources that pivot toward that market to stabilize their businesses and continue to grow in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524661">I look forward to seeing the vote on this and seeing this passed. I look forward to going back to farmers and forestry workers and telling them that we have given them another tool in their toolbox to be successful.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5524673">It is interested in another thing, and I will ask of my colleague today. I think we all recognize that the dairy sector is present in a majority of our ridings. This is a huge political conversation we are having. Therefore, the Dairy Farmers of Canada is interesting in hearing how MPs will explain these concessions to the dairy community in Canada. That is my question to the member.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5524674">Madam Speaker, I appreciate the hard work of the member on the trade committee. We may not agree on some things, but there are quite a few things on which we do agree. It is actually surprising.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524675">When it comes to the dairy sector, it is a tough problem. Basically, supply management is a problem. In every trade negotiation it comes up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524676"> I give the dairy farmers credit. For example, in CETA, basically for the benefit of the country as a whole, they allowed some market access. They agreed to that providing they had appropriate compensation for it. In TPP it was the same thing. They said that they wanted our beef, grain producers and manufacturers to do well, so if that meant they had to give up a bit of market access, providing they were properly compensated and the  pillars that were required for supply management were maintained, they would live with it. They did not like it, but they would live with it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524677">What happened when the Liberals took control? They lost the compensation part of the equation. Now the dairy farmers do not know what that scenario looks like. If the Liberals are saying that they will be there for them, they should tell them what that means, because they do not know. They do not understand. That is a fair question and the Liberals owe them an answer to that question.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5524678">Madam Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to express my support for Bill <Document DbId="9970461" Type="3">C-79</Document>, an act to implement the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-Pacific partnership between Canada, Australia, Brunei, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. I really do support this piece of legislation, particularly because where I come from in Whitby we have a lot of small businesses. We have a lot of middle-class families that depend on the growth and success of their businesses to be  able to provide for their children and to be able to provide for themselves for years to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524679">The fact is that the CPTPP allows access to Asia-Pacific markets. It is something that will really benefit not just the people of Whitby or the people of Durham region, but people right across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524680"> This particular agreement will open a market to an additional 500 million customers, resulting in 40% of the world economy. This allows us to not be solely reliant on the bulk of our trade going to the United States but opens up those markets and allows our businesses to be able to thrive in other jurisdictions. It is one of the largest free trade agreements in the world with access to a trading bloc of 495 million people, with a combined GDP of over $13.5 trillion. Canadian businesses will get preferential access, market access for our exporters to key markets in the Asia-Pacific region. I think that is critically important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524681"> One of the things that Canadians need to understand about this agreement and one of the things that we want to ensure that Canadians know and Canadian business owners know is that we have full confidence in their ability to grow their businesses and to do well by their customers, and to put forward business plans that allow them to grow. We have seen that over the last three years. We have seen the Canadian economy being the fastest growing in the G7.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524682">Our small businesses have created 500,000 jobs since we have taken office. They are the engine that drives our economy and we are creating even better conditions for them to get their goods and services to market. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524683">We have the lowest unemployment in 40 years. Our middle-class families are seeing and feeling the positive effects of our policies. A family of four right now here in Canada will be receiving $2,000 more in their pockets, so we are seeing the economy doing well. How do we make that better for businesses?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524684">I am going to go back to the previous speaker, who said that it was a tough three years and then he spoke about creating a level playing field for businesses. This government has done that. We reduced the small business tax rate for our businesses down to 9%. We are making sure that there is a level playing field. However, we can and we will do more. We are actively diversifying our trade, which is something that Canadians, when I go to the door in Whitby, are concerned about. They are concerned about NAFTA. They are concerned about steel and aluminum. They want to ensure that this government is taking the steps to not only make things better here on the ground but to also look forward and think how can we make things better. How can we allow our businesses to have access? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524685"> I want to talk about a couple of businesses in Whitby specifically. Whitby has a company called Greenwood Mushroom Farm. Not a lot of my riding is rural, but we have a few farms on the north end of the riding and they are really sophisticated, innovative enterprises. Greenwood Mushroom Farm is state-of-the-art facility in north Whitby.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5524686">Windmill Farms is the sales, distribution and marketing division of Greenwood Mushroom Farm, one of the largest mushroom-producing companies in Canada. It was built in the early 1960s. It has grown. They have made massive investments, ensuring that they are innovative and staying top-of-the-line. Going through the facility, there is no smell. They have a state-of-the-art compost facility. It is actually remarkable, and I would invite anybody to come to Whitby to tour this fantastic farm.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524687">The reason that I bring up the Greenwood Mushroom Farm, and I could bring up any number of farms in Whitby, is because of the benefits we see for agriculture and agri-food products through the CPTPP. They will benefit from immediate, duty-free treatment of tariffs on many products, to be phased out gradually. This will create, of course, new market opportunities, not just for vegetables and fruits but for other Canadian agriculture and agri-food products, beef and pork, cereals, maple syrup, spirits and a wide range of goods.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524688">I know the owners and people who work at Greenwood Mushroom Farms would appreciate the fact that we are looking at different ways for them to sell their products globally in a competitive way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524689">Again, this goes back to who is within these organizations. This is not some arbitrary company that is trying to grow. These are Canadian families. These are middle-class families that are trying to do the best they can to work at an organization, to stay competitive, to be able to expand and grow, and do what they need to do for their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524690">I would also like to talk about the technology industry. I think many people will be surprised to hear this. In Whitby, we have a number of thriving businesses in our downtown core. We are having an immense revitalization of our downtown. It is becoming a place where people want to hang out. We no longer go to Toronto; we stay in Whitby. There are things to eat and drink, and activities for families. People like to be downtown.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524691">It has the ability to be a place where people live, work and play. There is no longer the need, or we are creating what is no longer the need, for people to go to Toronto to go to work. We have companies like geekspeak that do global work, and companies like 360insights that work in international markets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524692"> Our tech industries are really supportive of the CPTPP, more than the TPP, because of the provisions we negotiated in intellectual property. These are companies of middle-class families. I actually knocked on the doors of the owners of geekspeak. I have seen their children. I know who they are. They want to be able to provide the services that they have taken from a little idea in a basement to a thriving enterprise within downtown Whitby, and to then take it to beyond the global enterprise that they currently have. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524693">It is critically important to understand that our companies want to be able to grow and succeed, and we are giving them the access to do that. We are creating the conditions by which they will be able to grow and succeed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524694">I would be remiss if I did not speak about the auto sector in Durham region. We have heard from many colleagues in here about the auto sector, and the challenges with NAFTA, with steel, with aluminum. The diversification of our products, goods and services to Asia-Pacific markets will help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524695">Right now most of our trade goes to the United States. The opportunity to have that go to a market of close to 500 million people will really impact our businesses in a positive way. We have confidence in our businesses. We have confidence in our small businesses. We have created the conditions domestically for them to succeed. We are now creating the conditions for them to succeed internationally.</ParaText>

Unifor Local 222 president Colin James represents 21,000 members. I am talking about the harm to auto, the loss of jobs to auto, how many people will be out of work who will not be able to enjoy Whitby in the way that she described it because of the CPTPP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524697">The member spoke about the tech industry. I will read a quote from committee, which heard from Jim Balsillie, the former CEO of the Canadian company Research In Motion. He said, “there's nothing in TPP that is specifically advancing any Canadian companies.” Canada would be a “colossal loser” under the TPP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524698">I want to go back to auto. I hope the member has done the work on this, representing auto workers. I would like her to explain to the House the interpretation of the CPTPP rules of origin and the connection to auto jobs being threatened in her riding of Whitby. I will note that the automotive parts manufacturers are predicting 20,000 jobs lost across our supply chain in Ontario. </ParaText>

I said I would be remiss if I did not mention auto at the end of my speech. I do not expect that the member opposite would agree. We have heard from New Democrats for most of today and yesterday that they do not agree with this particular trade agreement. In fact, they do not agree with many trade agreements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524701">I will talk about tech for a minute. We have made it very clear that we want to negotiate very good deals for Canadians. Our government has been very clear on ensuring that we are making investments in innovation, investments in ensuring that tech companies and other companies have a level playing field to be able to do well and succeed. We have made the necessary provisions within the CPTPP with intellectual property to ensure that they are succeeding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524702">When it comes to auto, again we need to be clear that our auto manufacturers within Whitby, within Cambridge and across the country, especially in Ontario, are facing challenges with NAFTA, with steel and aluminum. The ability to diversify our markets, to allow them to get their goods and services and auto parts to different markets is necessary. If the New Democrats cannot get on board with that, then I am not sure what they will be able to get on board with.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5524703">Madam Speaker, I have been listening to this debate throughout the day and I cannot help but revert back to this idea that the NDP wants nothing to do with trade whatsoever. The reality of the situation is, unfortunately, I guess, for its position, that the world is changing. As we see more globalization and opportunities for businesses to connect to other parts of the world, the reality is that trade is becoming a norm that we have to accept. I really hope that the NDP can, at one point, accept the fact that it is a reality.</ParaText>

When I knocked on doors this summer, many constituents in Whitby were concerned about what is happening with NAFTA, with steel and aluminum. We are demonstrating to the people of Whitby that we are looking at new opportunities to grow their businesses, to give them preferential and duty-free access to an area with over 500 million individuals. Access to those markets is a commitment of this government. This government is demonstrating that we believe strongly in small businesses, we believe in their capacity to expand, and we have confidence in their ability to grow and thrive within the Canadian market and beyond.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5524708">Madam Speaker, it is always good to be back in the House. It is good to see all of my colleagues here. I had a wonderful time in my riding of North Island—Powell River spending time with constituents and hearing their concerns. I am sure that most of the members here did the same in their ridings. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524709">I am here today to debate at second reading Bill <Document DbId="9970461" Type="3">C-79</Document>, which is an act to implement the comprehensive and progressive agreement for the trans-Pacific partnership between Canada and 10 other countries: Australia, Brunei, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. It is very important that we have an opportunity to debate this implementing legislation as the CPTPP is a huge agreement with far-reaching implications for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524710">In my riding of North Island—Powell River, there are several businesses that trade internationally. They are good businesses that provide jobs that support people meaningfully. I want to see trade that benefits people, businesses and communities in this wonderful country of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524711">The other part of living in my riding is the fact that my communities and I have lived through very hard times. I currently am seeing some of those hard times in some of the communities in my riding. An example in the past is when the mill shut down in Campbell River. I saw a lot of people lose their incomes. Soon afterward, some lost their homes. Many had to have one partner travel to another community to work while the remaining family members stayed at home and did their very best to survive. It was really hard as people lost their savings, and in many cases lost their physical and/or mental health. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524712">Losing one's job is absolutely terrifying. It is the very thing that puts food on the table and puts a roof over one's head. When people lose their job and cannot find meaningful employment, it can break so much in their life. I think of a community right now in my riding, Port Alice, which has been waiting several years for the mill to reopen after years of being closed. It is getting to the point that the mayor and council are having to make some very hard decisions about what resources they can have available to the people in their community and what resources they are going to have to shut down. No one wants to be in that position.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524713">I think about Catalyst Paper in Powell River and how the community came together to work so hard. The community, the unions, the mayor and council, the local representative from the province and I fought hard to overturn the countervailing duties. It was a lot of hard work. I really appreciate how hard the community and the business worked together. It was a big relief when those countervailing duties were overturned. However, during that time when so many in the community were unsure of what was going to happen and the community was worried that the mill would be shut down, I got a lot of emails and letters about that and their stress. They shared with me their concern. They wanted to know what it would mean for workers and the community at large. I want to thank everyone again for their amazing work in addressing this issue. It is a very scary situation to be in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524714">These are but a few of the realities that the people I represent face and are currently facing. With the CPTPP, this is what too many Canadians are facing. Those occupying the 58,000 jobs under threat are facing this type of experience going forward. As parliamentarians, we must take very seriously that the CPTPP threatens to kill thousands of good Canadian jobs. Once these jobs are gone, they are not easily replaced, and when they are replaced, it is often precarious, part-time, and low-wage work, or community members have to leave their community and families behind. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524715">It is the government's job to make sure that when we make opportunities for trade we open more doors rather than close them. Therefore, I hope that as we debate this issue, all parliamentarians keep in mind that the economic analysis conducted by Global Affairs Canada concluded that the CPTPP would generate economic gains for Canada of $4.2 billion. That sounds good, until we realize that this is over a period of 22 years. This is minimal. The sum of $4.2 billion represents the same level of economic output measured as gross domestic product Canada generates in one day. When we hold on one hand 58,000 family-supporting jobs and on the other $4.2 billion over 22 years, I am always going to vote to keep people working. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5524716">Some of my constituents have asked what the difference is between the TPP and the CPTPP. Well, besides more letters, I have to point out that there are not many differences. I am very sad to say that it contains the same harmful provisions on auto, dairy, temporary foreign workers, labour mobility, and investor-state dispute settlement. The idea that the TPP was somehow transformed into something progressive is simply not the reality of the text. In fact, it appears to be an attempt to mislead Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524717">In the communities I represent there are concerns about keeping people in our communities working. This trade agreement would allow companies to bring in temporary foreign workers without a permit process or a study on labour market impacts. Many of my constituents agree with me when I say that if someone comes to Canada as a temporary worker, he or she should be allowed to stay when filling in a long-term job. I am shocked when long-term work is filled in again and again with changing temporary foreign workers. That is simply not temporary work. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524718">When I look at our small communities and the challenges we face to attract and retain people, and as a parent who hopes that her children will settle close to home once their education is done, the ability of businesses to not connect with the local labour market and provide meaningful employment to the people in our communities concerns me deeply. The CPTPP expands these loopholes for companies to do this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524719">What is also missing from this trade agreement is the complete lack of safeguards in place to guarantee that foreign workers are getting paid what is in their contract with the employer. I spent over eight years working as the executive director of the Immigrant Welcome Centre serving all of north Vancouver Island. It was my job to support newcomers as they came to Canada, and they came in many different ways. Many migrant workers who came to our communities in the region had very positive experiences. There were a rare few who did not. The lack of support for these folks was just appalling. It is very hard to speak up against injustice when the risk to do so is so high. How can this be called a progressive trade agreement when this fundamental right has absolutely no safeguards for implementation? This is a severe gap and something that should be addressed seriously. That this is not being addressed is shameful in a country as great as Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524720">The response by the government to address many of these serious issues is to refer to the side letters. In fact, this is where the Liberals will point to in addressing all of the concerns that the New Democrats have. However, the reality is that these side letters are created with aspirational language that has absolutely zero enforceability. This is a serious problem. This is also where the Liberals point to the so-called progressive elements which carry very little weight compared to the text of the main agreement. Side letters simply cannot supersede the text of the main agreement, and a side letter is not enforceable through the agreement's dispute settlement mechanisms unless it is explicitly mentioned. This is a reality. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524721">I would really like to hear the Liberals address this in a reasonable way. It is time for a meaningful conversation about these issues. Quite frankly, I am tired of simply being accused of being a person who does not support trade at all. What we are asking for is the basic rights of people in this country to be appreciated. We are asking for the meaningful work that supplies families with jobs, that helps them put food on the table, that helps them put their children into school, be respected, and that if something is going to happen, we do not abandon those communities or those sectors but we stand with them and make sure that the outcome is not as terrifying as this trade agreement is setting them up for. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524722">In closing, I look forward to meaningful questions that really talk about this trade agreement. I have a lot of concerns, but my concerns are reflective of so many Canadians out there. What they want to hear are reasonable answers to those concerns. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524723">I look forward to the debate. I know that this is not going to go the way I want it to go, but I want the government to understand that we will bring up the voices of these people every single time, because the workers deserve to be supported and this country could do so much better.</ParaText>

I am wondering if she has any statistics on the other hand that talk about what the impact would be on Canada should Canada not be part of this particular trade agreement, if Canada chose an approach that the NDP seems to favour more, that of removing itself from trade deals. What would the impact be on Canada in terms of how that would affect us in our relationships and our ability to continue to create jobs, including good jobs in her riding?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5524739">Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to stand in the House to talk about Bill <Document DbId="9970461" Type="3">C-79</Document>, which is finally coming to fruition later this afternoon, to ratify the comprehensive and progressive agreement on the trans-Pacific partnership. Unfortunately it is disappointing that it has taken the Liberal government this long to get to this point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524740">Throughout the parliamentary session, the Conservative Party of Canada has given the Liberals ample opportunities to get this agreement ratified as quickly as possible. I recall earlier this winter, we outlined a process for them to expedite the approval of the CPTPP. Later in the spring, we tabled a motion to ratify the CPTPP immediately. Earlier this summer, the leader of the official opposition put forward a letter to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> asking him to ask the Speaker to recall Parliament as quickly possible so we could ratify this agreement. Every single step of the way, the Liberal government and the NDP blocked these opportunities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524741">I want to emphasize what we potentially could have risked. We may not have been one of the first signatories to this unprecedented trade agreement that would bring Canadian industries, including agriculture and energy, more than 500 million new customers. This is what was at risk. We had to be one of the first six countries to ratify this agreement. Once the first six countries ratify the TPP, it is enacted within 60 days.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524742">Let us put this into perspective. Had we not been, or we may not be yet, one of those first six countries, that is like going to the prom without a date, then asking for a dance once the music has started and everyone's dance card is already full. We would be sitting on the sidelines. It is very difficult to break into those markets once the trade agreements and side agreements are already made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524743">I have to emphasize through history just how important trade agreements have been. The previous Conservative government realized how important free trade agreements were. Prior to coming to office, Canada had free trade agreements with four countries. Over the 10 years under the previous Conservative government, we signed free trade agreements with more than 50 countries. The Canadian economy has felt the benefits of those free trade agreements in every level of the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524744">The Pacific region continues to experience among the fastest growth in the world. This is an incredible opportunity for Canadian industries, agriculture and energy to be part of the gem of this agreement, Japan, as well as fast and growing lucrative markets like Malaysia and Vietnam. The CPTPP will reduce tariffs in countries that represent 13% of the global economy. That is $10 trillion in GDP. This will create new opportunities and benefits for Canadian businesses, workers and consumers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524745">The CPTPP has the potential to boost Canadian income by more than $20 billion over the next decade. If we wait, Canadian firms risk losing jobs, opportunities, advantages and certainly will impact their supply lines. We cannot delay this any further. The risk to the Canadian economy is simply too great. We must be among the first countries to ratify this agreement so we can be part of those first opportunities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524746">That was why we urged the Liberals to table this legislation as soon as possible. That was why earlier this year we outlined a process to expedite the approval process, why we tabled the unanimous motion last spring to ratify the CPTPP and why we asked the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to bring this back this summer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524747">The new and preferential access under the CPTPP is projected to provide Canadian exporters with tariff savings of $428 million a year, with the bulk of those exports coming to Japan at a total of $338 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524748">I cannot stress enough how important this agreement is to Canada's agriculture sector and certainly to the farmers, ranchers and food processors in my riding of Foothills. The stakes for Canadian producers are high. They are high because of the damage the Liberal government has done with our foreign affairs and irritating our trusted trading partners. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524749">Our agriculture sector has lost vital trading markets like India for our lentils and pulses and Italy for our durum wheat. Certainly now with NAFTA hanging by a thread, we are at risk of losing the United States, our number one trading partner. At every opportunity, the Liberal government has antagonized the United States administration by constantly tabling progressive social value domestic issues that have nothing to do with an economic agreement.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5524750"> That is why we are in an incredibly weak negotiating position when it comes to NAFTA, which makes the CPTPP that much more important. We need to ratify this agreement so we would not only have those additional 800 million customers, but also have important leverage in the negotiations with the United States on NAFTA. I cannot express that enough. For example, Japan is Canada's third-largest export market for agri-food products. That amounted to almost $4 billion in trade in 2016 alone. Tariff cuts by Japan and Vietnam over five years could increase our annual exports of canola by $780 million and our beef exports by $380 million and our pork exports by $639 million. That the United States is out of the CPTPP makes those markets that much more lucrative. The opportunities for Canadian agriculture are incredible. With the tariff-free savings, our wheat and barley exports to Japan could go up by $167 million; our pork products by $51 million, our beef by $21 million, and our wood products $32 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524751">These products are essential pillars of the economy in my riding of Foothills. The tariff-free access to the markets like Japan would be felt throughout my riding. It would be felt at Cargill meats in High River, which employs 4,000 people; by the farmer in Claresholm; by the farm-implement dealer in Pincher Creek, and certainly by the ranchers in the municipal district of Ranchland. This would be felt in every single corner of my riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524752">According to research commissioned by the Canadian Agri-food Trade Alliance, the TPP would increase agri-food exports by $1.84 billion. Not being part of the TPP could cost Canadian agriculture almost $3 billion. There is simply no choice; we have to be part of this agreement. The agri-food sector is the biggest job creator in Canada, creating more than $2.1 million jobs and contributing 6.7% to Canada's GDP. To put that more simply, one in five jobs in Canada and 60% of our country's GDP are directly linked to exports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524753">As Conservatives, we understand the profound benefits of these free trade agreements. In fact, the TPP was negotiated by the previous Conservative government and very little of the language in the previous agreement has changed compared with what we are seeing here. What has changed is the delay after delay to achieve very minimal wording changes in the title. That has put our Canadian economy at risk for almost nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524754">There are incredible opportunities in the TPP, but unfortunately other opportunities would go unrealized. Not only is Japan looking for a secure supply of agri-food and agricultural products, but also for a secure supply of Canadian energy. It looks to Canada as a place of political stability, a place where it could have a reliable supply. While the trans-Pacific partnership would give us those opportunities, unfortunately the Liberal government has failed to provide the critical infrastructure to ensure that we can get our energy products to market and access those Asian opportunities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524755">The most critical piece of infrastructure was already approved and ready to go, with the northern gateway pipeline, but the Liberals made a political decision to cancel that pipeline, and now we have seen them bungle a second opportunity with the Trans Mountain expansion. Not only have they bungled that opportunity, but Canadian taxpayers are now on the hook for that pipeline at $4.8 billion and counting. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524756">On the one hand, we have incredible opportunities when it comes to agriculture and agri-food producers across the country, and certainly in my riding of Foothills. On the other hand, I am concerned about those incredible missed opportunities that would help people in our energy sector in Alberta and across the country. Because of mismanagement by the Liberal government, we will not be able to take advantage of those opportunities that would put thousands of people back to work.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5524770">Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise and speak on the subject of trade again. In the 21 years I have been in Parliament I have spoken on numerous occasions on our country's trade agenda. It is critically important, we all know. We are a small population with large natural resources, so foreign trade is extremely important for us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524771">In the early days, our trade with the U.S.A. was very high. We had a great trade relationship with the U.S.A. with our integrated economies. At that time we were in the opposition and we had a Liberal government in power. The Liberals talk about their trade agenda today, but they moved very slowly. At the time of prime ministers Chrétien and Martin, they did not sign too many trade agreements. They talked a lot about it, but they did not sign any meaningful trade agreements. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524772">Also, during that period of time the NDP was expressing some concern. Let us be very clear. The NDP has always opposed any trade agreement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524773">Then we recognized the fact that Canada needed to open up its markets and not rely on one market. Henceforth, our government's efforts were directed toward that, with the help of the department of foreign trade and foreign affairs. We have some very excellent public service officers who have had extreme experience in negotiating trade deals. They are non-partisan, and look after the interests of Canada. I want to make that point very clearly, because this government is trying to put their work down as if the public servants in the departments do not know what is good for Canada. The fact of the matter is, when our Conservative government came into power it realized that we needed to push this agenda very strongly. As my colleague has stated about the number of trade agreements we signed, let us not forget how many FIP agreements we signed around the world as well, because FIPA is the first step in going into international trade. The member for <Affiliation DbId="214072" Type="2">Abbotsford</Affiliation>, who led the file, worked extremely hard to ensure the groundwork was laid. Let us make it very clear that the groundwork was laid by the Conservatives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524774">The groundwork for CETA was laid by our government. The groundwork for TPP was laid by our government. NAFTA was, again, the Conservatives under Brian Mulroney. As we go forward, the groundwork for all trade agreements was done by the Conservatives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524775">Sure enough, when we changed government, the Liberals now recognize that these trade agreements are important. However, as usual, trying to please everyone, they do not look at the bigger picture and were more concerned with other agendas, and less for trade. It was only after the president of the U.S.A. started saying he wanted to renegotiate NAFTA, and with so many conditions, that we now face a situation where we need new markets. Suddenly, the Liberals have woken up. We cannot forget the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> leaving the other leaders waiting in Vietnam for them to talk about TPP.

              <ParaText id="5524776">We get an idea of what the Liberals are talking about in changing the TPP. We had been negotiating with the same governments for a long period of time. Do they think they have suddenly changed and have started accepting what the Liberal government is trying to say, and that the markets have changed in the TPP? That is nonsense. They have their position. Even though they are tinkering to make it look like it is a Liberal agenda, it was our government that laid the groundwork, and as far as it is concerned, it is delayed again. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524777">With the Trans Mountain pipeline now dropped, getting our resources to tidewater has been delayed and the impact on the economy is very strong. Now we see no pipeline to tidewater, no oil going out, and NAFTA now under challenge. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5524778">Now, suddenly, the Liberals have woken up and are saying they need TPP. Before that, if these things had not happened, the government's lacklustre agenda on trade would have been moving very slowly. Therefore, today I will say very clearly that I am very glad to have spoken in the House for 21 years on trade promotion for Canada, and to be the last speaker on this so that we can get this thing going very quickly. We need it implemented so we can get Canadian businesses working.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524779">Indeed, the NDP will always voice concerns about it and talk about job losses. However, the great part of the whole thing is that when the economy moves forward collectively, everybody gains. Even though there might be a slight change in a sector, they will gain over the long term. If we contract our market, then the loss of jobs is far higher than we can anticipate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524780"> Talking about farmers, my colleague sitting next to me is a successful farmer in Alberta, and he is also looking for markets to sell his crop. Therefore, when the NDP members say that the farmers are very worried, I can say that my colleague sitting next to me who is a farmer is not worried. He is looking for the opportunity that will allow him to sell his grain on the world market. This is what Canadian businesses are looking for. Therefore, let us look at the larger picture of what is important for this country. It is important for this country to have good trade agreements, so that Canadian businesses have a level playing field with other countries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524781">Trade agreements make level playing fields. As we see with China, we have an unlevel playing field. China has its own rules, which are not compatible with ours, and this is why the Chinese are not very keen. Neither were we, as the Conservative government, keen on opening free trade with China, because we have different regulations and systems. However, with other countries, and now with the opening market of Japan and all of these countries, we are looking at the growing economies of the world. We should be part of this growth, so that Canadians can benefit with jobs, jobs, jobs. Therefore, we need a collective approach from the government so that we can move forward. </ParaText>

Within months, we had the signing of the agreement between Canada and Ukraine. Do members remember the Canada-European Union agreement, the one that was off the tracks? It was this government that got it back on track, and with those 25 plus nations we actually got it signed off. Do members remember the World Trade Organization legislation that we had that enhanced and enabled additional trade? Liberals understand the importance of trade and the impact it has on Canada's middle class and those aspiring to be a part of it. That is why it is such a high priority for this government. </ParaText>

For 40 years, it has been keeping women and their children safe. It has been reaching out to police and other public safety officials. I believe it is partly because of the great efforts of Haven Society reaching out to the courts and working with lawyers and police officers in every aspect that Nanaimo has one of the lowest rates of unfounded sexual assault findings by the RCMP in the country. We are very proud of Haven's work and I thank it, its staff and volunteers who do such fantastic front-line service, especially the businesses and donors that support them.</ParaText>

It keeps women and children safe, and has been at the front line of domestic violence prevention and keeping women sheltered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524850">It reaches out to the RCMP and the criminal justice system. It works collaboratively with police to identify offenders and help them understand the cycles of violence and the particular aspects of domestic violence that might make women less willing to come forward or respond in a different way under questioning. That sensitivity and that collaboration have resulted in Nanaimo having one of the lowest rates across the country of “police finding cases of domestic violence to be unfounded.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524851">I thank Haven Society, its front-line workers, its volunteers, and people and businesses in the community that donate and support Haven Society. We are grateful for its work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524852">In light of the government's commitment to women's equality and the announcements it has made in its budget about its intentions, why has it not yet legislated changes to women's equality that would lead to changes on the ground?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524853">We have heard repeatedly, particularly at the status of women committee, about the cycle of economic impoverishment that starts with pay equity legislation not being in place federally. If women earn less than their partners, they are more likely to drop out of the workforce when they cannot afford child care. They may then have several years of interrupted earnings. When they return to the workforce, they are often in precarious part-time work with no access to benefits or unemployment insurance, which means that women in Canada retire in poverty in particularly serious ways.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524854">When is the government going to legislate pay equity? Why has it not yet legislated it? It has had three years, and it was 42 years ago that the first Trudeau government promised it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5524856">Since we were elected in 2015, our government has been committed to gender equality and has taken action. As one of its first actions, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> appointed the first-ever gender balanced cabinet and a full <Affiliation DbId="229211" Type="4">Minister of Status of Women</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524857"> Our government knows that when we invest in women, we strengthen the economy for everyone. It is not only the right thing to do; it is the smart thing to do. By taking steps to advance gender equality, we could add $150 billion to our economy in less than 10 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524858">This is why our government reversed the Harper government decisions and restored advocacy as an eligible activity for funding through the women's program. We provided more support to ensure that gender was at the heart of decision-making across the federal government. We also went across Canada and asked Canadians about solutions to gender-based violence in which the hon. member actively participated, and I know is very committed to. This led to the first ever gender-based violence strategy at the federal level in Canada, now with an investment of nearly $200 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524859">Building on budget 2017 and its gender statement, budget 2018 reflects our government's continued efforts to advance gender equality by ensuring gender equality is top of mind in the consideration of each and every budget decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524860">Budget 2018 includes investments in evidence-based policy capacity and a gender results framework in conversations with young Canadians on gender equality, a national round table on gender-based analysis, a strategy to engage men and boys in advancing gender equality and the sustainability of the women's movement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524861">Gender equality is a whole-of-government priority. That was why budget 2018 provided support to encourage greater gender equality in the home and in the workplace, with a $1.2 billion investment over five years to introduce a new employment insurance sharing benefit. Introducing this dedicated leave for the second parent will encourage more balanced distribution of caregiving responsibilities and contribute toward a society that recognizes that women and men can and should play equal roles in both paid and unpaid work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524862">Additional parental leave will give parents more time with their children and give families more flexibility to balance work and family responsibilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524863">Budget 2018 also introduced new investments to support women entrepreneurs, additional support for women in the skilled trades and to introduce pay transparency measures in the federally regulated sector. On the hon. member's direct question, we will be introducing proactive pay equity legislation this fall. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524864">Budget 2018 was really a milestone in our history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524865"> Our government is committed to gender equality not only just in words, but also in the solid actions that we have taken to improve the lives of women and men from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5524866">Mr. Speaker, with respect to my colleague on the Liberal side, the gender balanced cabinet, the Status of Women minister, round tables and strategies are all good things, but they are not changing women's lives right now. It is such a huge pent-up demand. With so much good will and words from the government, we really thought that three years into their mandate the Liberals would have made real changes in the lives of everyday women already, but it has not. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524867">This is a strong recommendation coming out of the status of women committee. Employment insurance has not been reformed by the government in a way that helps women. The use it or lose it parental leave that my colleague just mentioned will be a missed opportunity if the government does not expand access to parental leave benefits as too many parents in Canada do not qualify. Six out of 10 workers do not qualify for employment insurance benefits. That means they cannot get the access to leave.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524868">There is still no employment insurance reform that will address anything other than part-time work.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5524871">In budget 2018, we also announced that we would introduce legislation to solidify and formalize the role of Status of Women Canada as a full department. We want to ensure that regressive actions like those of the previous Harper government never happen again, because we simply cannot move forward when half of us are held back.</ParaText>

I have to say that the information that has come in since then is even more sobering, and potentially tragic. On April 19 I asked about climate change and how incompatible contemplating buying and building another pipeline would be with the goal of reducing greenhouse gases. </ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...the warnings of climate scientists are becoming increasingly urgent and worrying. The most recent, days ago, was that the world was watching the weakening of the Gulf Stream ocean currents, with potentially catastrophic impacts. The scientists are warning that we must reduce greenhouse gases far more rapidly than our current commitments. </QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="5524875">Just yesterday came another report about what is happening with the Gulf Stream and what that means for Atlantic Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524876">I see my friend, now the hon. parliamentary secretary. I commend him for his recent promotion to parliamentary secretary for environment. He represents a riding where I used to live with the impacts of what I am going to now say are devastating for Central Nova. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524877">This is from a recent study published in Nature Climate Change magazine. It is peer reviewed, top-quality science. I never expected to see this: "Rapid coastal de-oxygenation due to ocean circulation shift in the northwest Atlantic”, the study indicates, is threatening the survival of all marine life in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524878">The marine ecosystem in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, one of the richest and most biodiverse marine areas on the planet, is now anticipated to be one of the most endangered ecosystems as a result of climate change. Just to paraphrase the study, because I think it is important for parliamentarians to know this, as carbon dioxide levels have risen over the past century due to human emissions, the Gulf Stream has shifted northward and the Labrador Current has weakened. This new study finds that this causes more of the Gulf Stream's warm, salty and oxygen-poor water to enter the Saint Lawrence Seaway. The evidence of science is continually becoming stronger, more urgent and, in fact, clearly saying to policy-makers around the globe that we are in a climate emergency. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524879">We are not dealing with an environmental issue; we are dealing with a security threat. The Gulf of Saint Lawrence is the home of endangered whales. It is also the home of billions of dollars in fisheries' resources that are still successfully and sustainably fished. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524880">If the Gulf of Saint Lawrence is the canary in the coal mine for the collapse of oxygen in the world's oceans, then this parliament should do nothing but debate how we respond to climate change in a meaningful way. We should do nothing but talk about what is needed way beyond the minimal approach to carbon taxes or applying a price to carbon. We should be talking about what is necessary, not what is politically possible, because we are in a climate emergency. All this summer British Columbians know we had 500 wildfires. The people of my constituency and I had trouble breathing because our air quality was worse than Beijing's.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524881"> Climate change is a health threat. Climate change is an urgent security issue and, unfortunately, the government continues to pretend that the old Harper target is the Paris target. It is not. We need to be serious as parliamentarians. As grown-ups, it is time we started protecting our children.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5524882">Mr. Speaker, as always, I appreciate the comments from my colleague who represents the people of Saanich—Gulf Islands. I would like to thank her for raising the question and look forward to working with her in my new capacity. I thank her for her congratulations, as well. We have much in common. We are both coastal MPs. We both have experience living in my part of the world, and we are both dedicated to protecting our natural environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524883">The threat posed by climate change is real, and the member is correct to assert that we need to be debating not whether it is real but what we are going to do about it. I would like to share with her that when our government funds research at St. Francis Xavier University, which is in my community, I take the time to sit down with the professors whose research we are funding to learn more about the threat posed by climate change and how policy can adapt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524884">I have to point out that our commitment to protect the environment, in my opinion and the government's opinion, is not at odds with the principle that we can grow our economy as well. We can grow the economy and protect the environment at the same time. ln fact, positive developments that protect the environment can in fact help spur economic growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524885"> For example, the International Energy Agency tells us that implementing the Paris Agreement could boost the global economy by $19 trillion over the next 30 years. I am committed and this government is committed to meeting our Paris Agreement targets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524886">This tells us that now is the time to be investing in innovation, clean technology and green infrastructure. As we transition to a green economy, we will stimulate clean growth, spark Canadian innovation and entrepreneurship and create good-paying jobs. We can grow the economy and protect the environment at the same time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524887">Canada moved from seventh to fourth place in a global clean tech innovation index. I know that we can attribute this jump to many Canadians, businesses and individuals, and their willingness to adapt and innovate. Take, for example, General Fusion in the member's own province of British Columbia which is developing a process that could unleash the energy potential of fusion. As well, there is the Squamish-based company, Carbon Engineering, that is developing an innovative technology to capture carbon from the air and produce fuels.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524888"> ln my own province, we have companies like CarbonCure that is sequestering emissions to make strengthened concrete, and the Trinity Energy Group in Pictou County that is employing people to help make homes more efficient. These examples of innovation in the private sector are made possible by the creativity of people locally, but also with the conditions we are creating to promote clean investments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524889">Over the next 11 years, the government is investing over $21.9 billion in green infrastructure. We are investing over $20 billion to support urban public transit projects. We are investing over $2 billion over the next 11 years to support the priorities of rural and northern communities. We are investing over $9 billion to support projects that reduce emissions, deliver clean water, manage waste water, build cleaner, better-connected electricity systems, and help communities adapt to climate change. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524890">These investments are in addition to the $1.5 billion we have committed to protect our oceans. During her remarks, the hon. member raised the importance of the gulf region, which is dear to my heart. This commitment is going to go a long way to protect our nature and wildlife that depends on it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524891">I am proud of these investments and the steps our government is taking to reduce pollution, such as putting a price on carbon, developing policies to reduce methane emissions, and taking steps to reduce pollution from hydrofluorocarbons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524892">These are serious measures, and I look forward to working with the hon. member opposite, as we have over the past few years, and whom I have great respect for. I sincerely thank for her the opportunity to address her questions.</ParaText>

This is a time that reminds me of what Churchill faced in those five days of May back in 1940 when they told him, and everybody who knew anything about the situation told him, that it was hopeless and that he had better surrender.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524894">This is not a time for fossil fuel appeasement. We cannot pretend we can build more pipelines or expand the oil sands and still meet the threat of the climate crisis. This is a moment when we need a Dunkirk solution. What is a Dunkirk solution? Churchill saw that the entire army was stranded on the beach. There were 300,000 men that they could not rescue from Hitler's force. They had no defences for their island if they should be invaded. Churchill did not give up. He said, “Wait a minute. How many civilian boats are over there in Dover? There are 80,000 civilian boats, you say? Let's marshal those people and get going.”</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5524900">Mr. Speaker, it should be uncontroversial, but Christians are among the most persecuted faith community. Christians face violence and persecution on the basis of their religion in over 60% of countries, by some estimates, and yet we encounter in the House on a regular basis the baffling refusal of the government and its fellow travellers in the political far left to even acknowledge the existence of persecution against Christians. The government is generally absent when it comes to international human rights. Its particular hostility toward the Christian community is evident in its lack of response to this vital issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524901">I asked the following question to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> at the end of the fall sitting. </ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Mr. Speaker, yesterday the foreign affairs minister finally acknowledged genocide of Yazidis at the hands of Daesh in Syria and Iraq. However, the government has yet to acknowledge genocide against Christian communities in the same areas, Assyrian, Chaldean and other Christians who live in communities alongside Yazidis and have often been treated in exactly the same way. </QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524904">That was my question. In response to the question, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> refused to acknowledge the genocide of Christians, but he actually also refused to even mention the experience of Christians. He did not even use the word “Christian” in his response. This was not an accident. I have on three previous occasions asked the <Affiliation DbId="229209" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> to recognize the targeting of Yazidis and Christians by Daesh as genocide. She responded in each of these three cases that yes, they are very concerned about the plight of Yazidis, with no mention of Christians and no mention of the experience of Christian victims of genocide. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524905">The government very often gives verbal acknowledgement without action, but in this case, it repeatedly and by all indications intentionally refused to even give verbal acknowledgement to the persecution of Christians. Its disdain is evident. It has chosen either to completely write off Christians in the next election or to simply be blinded by ideology.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524906">What is the ideology at stake? This far left strain of thought I think assigns value to people and their experience based on whether or not they are considered privileged. If we think they have historically been privileged, then we assign less value to their experience, and if we think they have been historically underprivileged then perhaps we care more. So often these so-called privilege points are assigned in total ignorance of the realities on the ground. The left considers Christians to be historically privileged and also mistakenly sees Christian presence in certain parts of the world as a colonial artifact, so they ignore the genuine suffering of the indigenous people of the Middle East and elsewhere who never enjoyed any privilege in any sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524907">Advocates for the rights of Christian minorities around the world are not seeking the extension of domestic debates about the role of religion in public life. They are simply trying to respond to the reality of human suffering, human suffering that generally goes unacknowledged and certainly unaddressed by the government. Human suffering is ignored by the government if the victims happen to be Christian.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524908">It goes without saying that Christians are not the only religious minority facing persecution or that merit our attention, but Christians are the ones most likely to be ignored, and that is unacceptable. Canadians deserve better than that from the government. They deserve a foreign policy characterized by an authentic commitment to humanism and pluralism. An authentic commitment to those values would include a willingness to confront human rights abuses that impact anyone regardless of their faith, and even if they are Christian. It is high time the government stopped ignoring the epidemic of anti-Christian violence around the world and actually made the universal advancement of human rights a priority. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5524909">Mr. Speaker, I would like to start off by saying that we thoroughly and completely condemn the appalling and inhumane actions of Daesh in Syria and Iraq. Its members have committed terrible atrocities against religious and ethnic communities and vulnerable populations in the region. This includes appalling levels of violence committed against Christians and Yazidis, Turkmen, Sabean-Mandaeans, Druze, Kurds, Shia and Sunni Arabs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524910"> Christians are among those who, because of their smaller numbers, have borne a very heavy, indeed, a terrible and tragic burden. While many armed opposition groups in Syria have pledged to protect Syria's vulnerable religious and ethnic minorities, sectarian rhetoric has inspired incitement to hatred and violence against various religious and ethnic communities. We must take every step possible to ensure accountability for these crimes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524911">That is why Canada has formally requested the UN Security Council to establish a mechanism to investigate the potential violations of international law by Daesh. This includes the crime of genocide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524912"> We have also provided $7.5 million to the Commission for International Justice and Accountability to investigate violations of international humanitarian law and criminal law in both Syria and Iraq.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524913"> Canada is also playing an important military role in fighting Daesh through our role in the global coalition. Our government has also welcomed vulnerable refugees from the region to Canada, as has already been mentioned by my hon. colleague. This is something that I know many Canadians are very proud of, and as a former soldier who has dedicated a portion of his life to fighting terrorism, I applaud this initiative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524914">Under our government, Canada will remain a partner to the people of the region who have suffered so needlessly and so tragically. That is why we are looking to help the future of the populations that have been affected. What matters to many now is how they can go about rebuilding their lives and their communities. Canada can and will play an important role in ensuring that vulnerable communities across Syria and Iraq, including Christians, are allowed to live in peace and security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524915"> To this end, we are committing $840 million in humanitarian assistance to United Nations agencies. The International Committee of the Red Cross will also benefit from this as will international non-governmental organizations to meet the needs of the most vulnerable in Syria, Iraq and the region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524916"> In 2017, with funding from Canada and other donors, humanitarian partners reached 5.3 million people in Syria with food assistance; 1.8 million people in Iraq with emergency water and sanitation activities; and over 4.5 million beneficiaries in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Jordan with sexual and reproductive health services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524917"> By helping to address the underlying causes of the crisis in Syria and Iraq, and at the same time carrying the fight to Daesh through combat action and combat support, we will continue to contribute to the efforts to improve the security and rights of ordinary Iraqis and Syrians who are most affected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524918"> We strongly believe that religious freedom is a vital and fundamental human right and one that should be strongly protected. That is why in July my colleague, the former parliamentary secretary, represented Canada at the first U.S.-sponsored ministerial to advance religious freedom. We joined 80 other countries in condemning the systemic ongoing egregious abuses of religious freedom perpetrated by terrorists and violent extremist groups, specifically Daesh.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5524919"> Canada will continue to support all affected populations. </ParaText>

The government has recognized not just the need for further study, but the obvious reality that a genocide was committed against Yazidi people.
