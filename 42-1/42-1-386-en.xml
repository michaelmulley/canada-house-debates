          <ParaText id="5788988">The House resumed from December 11, 2018, consideration of the motion.</ParaText>
          <ProceduralText TocType="TPC" id="1">Motion</ProceduralText>
          <Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Sansoucy" id="10502992">
            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="214064" Type="2">Ms. Brigitte Sansoucy (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5788989">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to Motion No. 206, which New Democrats will oppose even though we feel there is an urgent need to encourage Canadians to be more physically active and less sedentary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5788990">The Liberals are doing the same thing here that they did with pharmacare. They want to study an issue that is already very well documented instead of taking steps that will really make a difference for people. If the sponsor of the motion had done his homework, he would have learned that the points he raised in his motion were already addressed in a joint report by federal, provincial and territorial ministers on May 31, 2018. Instead of duplicating a report that is barely 10 months old, the member should be pushing his government to act on the 46 recommendations in that report immediately. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5788991">The riding of Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot is lucky to have extraordinary people who help our children learn and grow through sport. Dedicated volunteers spend countless hours nurturing our kids' love of sport and helping them excel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5788992">People in my riding are passionate. Some have been involved in the sporting community for so long that they have inspired generations of locals. One person in particular, Louis Graveline, has devoted the past 50 years to judo students in Saint-Hyacinthe. What an honour it is to talk about Mr. Graveline in the House. Imagine spending 50 years sharing one's passion with several generations of students. That is quite an achievement. Former students describe him as passionate, persistent, firm and caring.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5788993">Another individual who comes to mind is Normand Ménard, from our athletic club, who has influenced generations of children who are now adults. Mr. Ménard has run the equivalent of the distance around the earth three times. Speaking of running, for 25 years now, Saint-Hyacinthe has been hosting the Défi Gérard-Côté, an event that brings together runners of all ages and all skill levels. It is a fun, not-to-be-missed event in Saint-Hyacinthe, with various categories including school, family, individual and corporate teams.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5788994">Acton Vale has had its own event for runners of all ages, the Défi des semelles d'Acton Vale, for six years now. Acton Vale has also been thrilled with the success of its baseball team, the Castors d'Acton Vale. I must acknowledge Michel Dorais for his volunteer work with the team, as well as the Fonds d'athlète de la MRC d'Acton, which supports the work of these exceptional athletes every year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5788995">I could go on and on naming many other cheerleaders, everyone from the ProCheer club to André Cournoyer and Vincent Cournoyer from the Défi Futsal, as well as our two figure skating clubs, one in Acton Vale and one in Saint-Hyacinthe. For swimming fans, I would be remiss if I did not mention the Corporation aquatique maskoutaine and the remarkable athletes in both our swimming club and synchronized swimming club.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5788996">In both Acton Vale and Saint-Hyacinthe, we have the privilege of counting on volunteers who dedicate their time to our young people, getting them excited about our national sport, hockey. I am proud to announce to all my colleagues that Saint-Hyacinthe will host the Telus Cup in April 2020. This major sporting event is an opportunity for hockey players from the best teams in the country to show off their talent in a very competitive tournament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5788997">We have some excellent hockey teams in Acton Vale and Saint-Hyacinthe, and I want to commend the volunteer boards of directors and coaches of these teams for their hard work. To name just a few, there is Lucien Beauregard, from the Saint-Hyacinthe pee-wee hockey tournament; Francis Morin, from the Saint-Hyacinthe minor hockey association; Christiane Lussier, Sylvie Carbonneau and the Festi-MAHG board of directors; the Acton Vale minor hockey association; DEK Hockey Saint-Hyacinthe; the Acton Vale provincial midget tournament; the Saint-Hyacinthe Gaulois team; and Noémie Marin, from Acton Vale, who was appointed head coach of the women's team that will represent Quebec at the 2019 Canada Games.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5788998">Did members know that a woman from my region was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame? Danielle Goyette, from Saint-Nazaire, was inducted in 2017. This was an honour for all of Quebec, since she was the first woman from Quebec and the fourth woman to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. The people of Saint-Hyacinthe and Acton Vale are talented, and they win medals everywhere they go. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5788999">Today, I am proud to tell members about the accomplishments of the high-performance athletes in my riding who are doing Quebec and Canada proud. Julien Pinsonneault from Saint-Hyacinthe is the Canadian snowshoe champion, and Béatrice Boucher from Saint-Dominique continues to impress the equestrian world. At last year's North American championships, this young woman was the top Canadian rider in dressage and won three medals. She also won the gold medal in the young riders division team event. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789000">There is also Annie Moniqui from the La machine rouge weightlifting club, as well as the entire Darsigny family, which includes Olympian Yvan Darsigny and future Olympians Tali, Matt and Shad Darsigny. The club always wins all the medals in international competitions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789001">I am also thinking of Francis Charbonneau, the mixed martial arts champion, Jean-Sébastien Roy, the Canadian motocross champion who was inducted into the Canadian Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 2012, and sensei Guy Brodeur of the Guy Brodeur martial arts centre. In 1985, he became world karate champion, winning not one, but two medals. Mr. Brodeur was a pioneer in this discipline and has been passing on his love of karate to young people ever since.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789002">Throughout their school years, kids can also count on experienced coaches to teach and guide them through their development. I am thinking about school clubs like the Patriotes at Saint-Joseph secondary school in Saint-Hyacinthe, the Drakkar at Hyacinthe-Delorme secondary school, the Titans at Robert-Ouimet secondary school, and the badminton club at Robert-Ouimet secondary school.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789003">We are also fortunate to have organizations that look after the well-being of our young people. I am thinking about Jeunes en santé, an organization that promotes a healthy and active lifestyle and healthy living habits for children from infancy to age 17. I want to take a moment to recognize the new coordinator, Jézabel Legendre, who is taking over for Véronique Laramée, who worked with our young people for 15 years. I thank Véronique for her work and I welcome Ms. Legendre.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789004">We can also rely on recreational facilities and those who run them. In every neighbourhood in Saint-Hyacinthe, every town and municipality in my riding, recreation coordinators, most of whom are women, work to keep our young people active all year long, especially through the various day camps that are run throughout the summer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789005">I am proud to represent these high-level athletes and these volunteers who are dedicated to sharing their passion and love of sport with these athletes. Congratulations to all of them. They are an inspiration to us all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789006">Our communities did not wait for a motion. We took matters into our own hands and got our kids moving. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789007">Provinces and territories have been making all kinds of healthy living commitments for decades. Whether at the municipal, provincial or territorial level, communities want to get kids moving. All they are waiting for is support from the federal government. This support was well documented in a report from just 10 months ago. The report made 46 recommendations for the federal government to implement immediately. The time has passed for studying the importance of a healthy lifestyle and the importance of moving. Now it is time for action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789008">For all these reasons, we will be voting against the motion. We believe it is time for action.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="214019" Type="2">Mr. Peter Fonseca (Mississauga East—Cooksville, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5789009">Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak to a motion that I believe will touch all Canadians' lives in a positive way. With Motion No. 206, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214121" Type="2">Newmarket—Aurora</Affiliation> has been a tremendous champion and advocate for active living through the example of his family, his wife and his kids, and how they participate. Motion No. 206 would lift up the many athletes and those achieving new goals in physical activity in his community, roll that out and study how that can have such a tremendous effect on all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789010">I think back to some of the commercials from our past that are decades old, where Participaction commercials had a 72-year-old Swede as compared to the 40-year-old Canadian. They were at the same level of health, but the Swede was doing more active things and it showed in less disease and a better quality of life. This is what Motion No. 206 is all about. It is about closing that gap in a very comprehensive way, as the member has put forward, not just about physical activity but the enumerable benefits that come through physical activity, socially and emotionally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789011">Many people who pick up a sport or try an activity like walking or jogging, riding a bike or swimming say that it lifts their self-esteem. Somebody being able to walk around the block the first day and then walk around two blocks a week or two later feels that sense of accomplishment in the goal they have reached.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789012">That is why the Government of Canada is so supportive of Motion No. 206. It instructs the House Standing Committee on Health to study fitness and physical activity levels in youth in Canada. The study would provide an opportunity to examine the complex factors and conditions that influence youth participation in physical activity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789013">There is a vast majority of Canadians who do not get enough physical activity today. At least eight out of 10 adults and six out of 10 children and youth do not meet the recommended guidelines for physical activity. Simply put, Canadians need to move more and sit less.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789014">As they grow up, Canadian youth participate less in sport, especially girls. While 79% of boys and 70% of girls participate in sport in adolescence, girls tend to drop out of sport at a much higher rate than boys do. Moreover, if a girl has not yet participated in sport by the age of 10, there is only a 10% chance that she will be physically active later on as an adult. Understanding the reasons behind these trends is key to reversing them and in turn closing that gap.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789015">The proposed study will be an opportunity to hear a range of perspectives regarding this important issue, including the steps that the Government of Canada and its partners have taken to increase physical activity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789016">For instance, the Public Health Agency of Canada, through its community-based initiatives, aims to increase physical activity among youth and families in partnership with the non-governmental sector, the private sector and others. The Public Health Agency of Canada has invested $112 million and leveraged an additional $92 million, which is just terrific, from its amazing partners to support projects and address the common risk factors, including physical inactivity associated with major chronic diseases. We know we are at an epidemic with diabetes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789017">Some of these projects target children and youth, for example, the APPLE Schools Foundation is leading an initiative called “Transforming Healthy School Communities” to improve health behaviours among children and youth in the school environment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789018">Another project, Sharing Dance, led by the National Ballet School of Canada, provides creative dance opportunities for youth to get active. Alongside these projects, the Public Health Agency of Canada has supported efforts to increase physical activity through programming that addresses healthy weights and mental health. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789019">Mental health is so important when it comes to physical activity. It is shown that if someone participates in physical activity, there are not only the health attributes of being physical, but also the social and mental benefits. When we say mental, it leads to less bullying.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5789020">Getting back to self-esteem, someone having higher self-esteem would give that person the ability to shelter themselves from bullying by others who may be sending negative signals, when participating in sport is for the most part about being a positive individual.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789021">In addition, budget 2018 announced new investments in support of increased physical activity among Canadians. The government provided $25 million in more funding over five years to Participaction, which I just spoke about. We are already seeing progress with this funding. A few weeks ago, Participaction launched an app that can help Canadians, young and old, track their activity levels and encourage them to be more physically active. I encourage everybody to get this app. It is based on leading-edge technology, delivering tailored content to Canadians based on their needs and interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789022">In addition, members may have seen billboards and other creative media promoting Participaction's evidence-based prompts to help Canadians move more and sit less. As the Participaction campaign notes, everything is better when someone is active. I can attest to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789023">Budget 2018 also announced $47.5 million over five years, and $9.5 million per year ongoing, to expand the use of sport for social development in more than 300 indigenous communities. Not only will this funding support increased physical activity, it recognizes the important connections between physical activity and other dimensions of our lives, such as mental well-being, social connection and academics. I have been a part of a program called running and reading, which has shown that if students go out for a run or do some physical activity before they do a test, read or immerse themselves in academia, they do much better. It is conclusive. We know it works. Again, this will have immeasurable types of impacts on our society, Canadians, as well as our youth, right through to adulthood and into their senior years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789024">Supporting Motion No. 206 will provide an opportunity to learn about how we can all work together on this important issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789025">No one organization or sector can work in isolation to tackle the problem of physical inactivity in this country. It is why the federal, provincial and territorial ministers responsible for sport, physical activity and recreation together released a policy framework to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary living in Canada. The framework is appropriately named “A Common Vision for increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary living in Canada: Let's Get Moving”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789026">The framework represents considerable collaboration by federal, provincial and territorial health officials, the non-governmental sector and indigenous organizations to identify areas of common interest and action. It identifies a number of areas for focus, such as cultural norms, spaces and places, and leadership and learning. These areas of focus can help guide our collective action over the coming years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789027">I know that the member for <Affiliation DbId="214121" Type="2">Newmarket—Aurora</Affiliation> has been passionate about this. He has promoted this in his community. He has has brought this forward to the House of Commons as Motion No. 206, so we can look at how we can now deliver the vision he has had for so long to the rest of Canada from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789028">Everyone has a role to play. Communities, academia, the charitable and not-for-profit sector and the private sector must find ways to work together if we are to be successful in getting Canadians to move more and sit less.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789029">An example of the importance of evidence is the "Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines” produced by the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology, with support by the Public Health Agency of Canada. The guidelines are currently available for children aged zero to four and children and youth aged five to 17, and were produced using the latest scientific evidence. These guidelines have adopted a novel approach, which results in the integration of physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep. In other words, they place physical activity and sedentary living in the context of our daily lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789030">In conclusion, the government is supportive of this study. It would provide an opportunity to learn from the many important investments, initiatives and undertakings that have been made by the Government of Canada and its many valuable partners, which have been working together to increase physical activity. Most importantly, this study would focus increased attention on an issue that is most important to the well-being of all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789031">I commend the member for <Affiliation DbId="214121" Type="2">Newmarket—Aurora</Affiliation> and thank him. We wholeheartedly support Motion No. 206.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="214172" Type="2">Mr. Robert Kitchen (Souris—Moose Mountain, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5789032">Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to speak in support of Motion No. 206. This motion would go a long way towards helping Canadian families, and especially our youth, with being active through participation in sport and other physical activities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789033"> I would also like to thank my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214464" Type="2">Simcoe—Grey</Affiliation>, for her hard work on dealing with the issue of sport. In particular, her private member's bill looking at tax credits would further assist in getting Canadians active in today's world. As the deputy shadow minister for youth, sport and accessibility, it was my pleasure to see not only the member's private member's bill on a tax credit being introduced into the House of Commons, but also this motion focusing on physical activity, which I support. Sport enhances many health issues, such as obesity, diabetes, joint mobility, pain, arthritis and more. It also positively affects physiology, fitness, goal setting, team work, dedication, positive self-esteem, friendships, psychomotor skills as well as new interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789034"> Statistics show that obesity is set to affect over 30% of the Canadian population by 2030. That is a very troubling number. Not only is obesity itself an issue, but we must also consider the negative health effects that obesity can cause. Diseases such as type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure can seriously affect a person's quality of life. The treatment of these diseases, which are widely preventable through diet and exercise, also puts an increased burden on our health care system and in turn the taxpayer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789035">Before becoming a member of Parliament, I was a chiropractor. During my practice, I saw first-hand the negative ways that obesity can impact the human body, causing issues like cardiovascular problems, fatigue, joint pain and sometimes limited mobility, not to mention the huge impact on self-esteem. It is clear that something needs to be done to incentivize Canadians, particularly young Canadians, to keep healthy and active in order to avoid potential future problems. This motion would help to do just that, as it did in its previous iteration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789036">Participation in sporting activities is a major challenge for families, who are living day to day and paycheque to paycheque, attempting to keep their children active and fit. A small tax break, such as was suggested by the member for <Affiliation DbId="214464" Type="2">Simcoe—Grey</Affiliation>, would be a helping hand and perhaps impetus to get involved. Not everyone can benefit from the kindness of others, a family member or philanthropic endeavour to help pay to include their children in sport. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789037">In Saskatchewan, we have an organization called “Sask Sport”, which helps families. I had the pleasure within my community to assist some families who needed help through one aspect of the program, KidSport. The assistance comes through many means. KidSport is one program. Others are Dream Brokers, Children in Sport, the aboriginal sport development program, Parasport, long-term athlete development program and Sport for Life. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789038">These programs focus on the concept that no kids should be left on the sidelines and that all should be given the opportunity to experience the positive benefits of organized sport. They involve children and youth, those attending elementary schools, with fundamental skills-development programs, as well as focusing on increasing participation by first nations and Métis communities. The assistance spans from the community level to high-performance levels. They help to build and create active and healthy communities through these programs by enabling non-profit sporting organizations to deliver quality sustainable programs, services and events.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789039">We know that the original children's fitness tax credit worked. Introduced in December 2006 and implemented in January 2007, according to the Department of Finance, 1.8 million Canadian families claimed the credit in 2014, which is 43% of all families with children. This is something that we want to encourage to get more people involved and more active in sporting activities. I believe that Motion No. 206 would assist in that manner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789040">My colleagues on all sides of the House are able to attest to the expenses that come with putting their children in sports. My wife and I raised two sons and a daughter, all of whom were involved in athletics while growing up. Believe me, it is not cheap. The cost of equipment for Canada's beloved sport alone, hockey, can be in the thousands of dollars, and figure skating can be triple that cost. Many Canadian families do not have that kind of money, so they are left with a choice of whether to put their children in sports knowing the health and various other benefits that has, or whether they pay their bills next month.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5789041">We feel that no parent should have to make that kind of choice, and a child fitness tax credit would definitely work to help mitigate that type of situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789042">I would like to take a moment to talk about the benefits of child and youth participation in sport and physical activity. The most obvious benefit would be to general physical health. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789043">As I previously stated, many diseases associated with obesity can be prevented with diet and exercise. In 2014, the OECD reported that overweight and obesity rates in Canada were high, with almost 28% of 11- to 15-year-olds being considered overweight or obese. This is troubling, given that the OECD world average at the time was 19%. It is clear, from a physical perspective, that our children and youth are not getting enough activity. Any incentive to improve on that statistic should be pursued and implemented. We know that most times healthy children grow into healthy adults, and it is up to all levels of government to assist in the pursuit of the physical health of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789044"> Participation in physical activity is also hugely beneficial for the brain and mental health. In 2018, the Participaction report card on physical activity for children and youth focused on this, outlining the connection between physical health and brain health. It stated that there are numerous benefits of physical activity for the brain, such as increased focus and attention span, better performance in academic settings due to increased memory, lower levels of depression and anxiety and much more. In this day and age, when more children than ever are spending increasing amounts of time looking at screens, we need to ensure that every option to participate in physical activity is given so that the next generation of Canadians can grow into healthy and happy adults.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789045"> My own personal experiences have also taught me a lot about how physical activity and participation in sport can positively affect children and youth, and not just on a physical or mental health level. I coached hockey for many years in Saskatchewan. I saw first-hand how many life skills young athletes can pick up by being part of a team or by participating in competitions. These skills included things like leadership, teamwork, co-operation, self-esteem, sociability and more. It was always amazing to see a young player start the season as a shy, introverted person and end it as a confident and more outspoken individual. I am proud to have been able to play some role in that transformation, and today I am proud to be speaking in support of an initiative that will help to build these skills for Canadian children and youth well into the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789046">Earlier in my remarks, I mentioned the 2018 Participaction scorecard. I would like to go back to that for a moment. Each year, Participaction assesses child and youth physical activity in Canada and gives it a letter grade. Unfortunately, the grade given for overall physical activity in 2018 was a dismal D+. That means that only 35% of five- to 17-year-olds are meeting the physical activity recommendation within the “Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines” for children and youth. With obesity being a growing epidemic, paired with increased amounts of screen time for children and youth of all ages, these statistics are very concerning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789047"> Also included in that report is a specific grade given to government for the strategies and investments it has implemented to encourage greater participation in physical activity for Canadian children and youth. The grade given in 2018 was a C+, which shows that there is absolutely room for improvement. We, as legislators, need to pursue all avenues available to us to address issues like childhood inactivity, which includes supporting initiatives such as this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789048">We know that Canadian families deserve support from their government, particularly when it comes to keeping money in their pockets. The fact that 43% of all Canadian families with children utilized the original children's fitness tax credit proves that there is a need for government assistance in this specific area. I am confident that any type of financial assistance or initiative would be great in helping to motivate people to increase their level of activity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789049">I am also extremely pleased and happy to see the inclusion of disabilities in these motions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789050">As I stated before, we know, and research shows, that healthy children become healthy adults. By instilling good habits and practices, such as regular physical activity for our children and youth, we are helping to grow a healthier, happier and more productive Canada. That is something I believe all members of this House can get behind.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5789051">Mr. Speaker, as always, it is an honour and a privilege to speak in the chamber. Today I am especially honoured to have brought this motion to the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789052">First, I want to thank all hon. members who spoke in support of the motion. I thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="213918" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation>, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214161" Type="2">Brampton South</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="214586" Type="2">Barrie—Springwater—Oro-Medonte</Affiliation>, all of whom spoke at first reading. Today we heard from the member for <Affiliation DbId="214019" Type="2">Mississauga East—Cooksville</Affiliation>, who is a former Olympian, and the member for <Affiliation DbId="214172" Type="2">Souris—Moose Mountain</Affiliation>. I thank these members for their support. I am glad that they share my concern about the importance of this motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789053">I know my time is limited, but I also want to thank all the organizations and individuals who reached out to me during this process. I thank them for sharing their expertise with me, and I thank them for their commitment and passion regarding the important goal of improving the health of children. After all, I think we can all agree that an active child is a healthy child. Organizations like Activate Aurora, the Nova Scotia Fitness Association, Active For Life, ParticipACTION and Sport Matters all provided invaluable input.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789054">I also want to thank Lisa Bowes, now a children's author, who writes books about a girl named Lucy who tries different sports. She gave me some invaluable advice, and I appreciate her commitment to this. Ted Jarvis and Glenn Young also reached out with their input.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789055"> All these people are experts in this field, and they all agree that the federal government needs to play a role for us to reach our goal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789056">It is obviously important for the House to pass this motion. Everyone agrees that physical activity levels are not where they ought to be. The benefits of children being active are indisputable. In fact, our understanding of the health benefits continues to grow and expand, especially the mental health benefits. They are as integral a part of being a healthy child as the physical component.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789057">Much work has been done in this regard. The government's common vision contains many great recommendations. However, this is not enough to get where we need to be. The 2018 ParticipACTION report card shows the areas in which we are failing our children. Only 35% of children aged five to 17 are meeting movement guidelines. This is unacceptable. We are not doing our job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789058">There is also much research regarding physical literacy and the harm that comes from too much screen time. The social benefits of having an active child continue to grow. All this work needs to be harnessed and mobilized by the health committee, which can then make prescriptive recommendations to the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789059">I have two young boys, Kolton and Kash. I am also the son of a phys. ed. teacher, who unfortunately passed away months before I became an MP. He always encouraged me to be physically active, to try new sports, to play outside and to have fun with my friends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789060">I want my children and all Canadian children to be as active as possible. I want them all to have the same concept that physical play and physical activity is good and ought to be pursued.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789061">The children growing up today face a very different childhood than I had. Social media was not a factor. Bullying was not as rampant. Screen time was not the threat to the well-being of our children it is today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789062">We need to harness the research out there. We need to make sure that the federal government plays the role it ought to play. I believe that the federal government has a significant role to play in ensuring that all Canadian children are physically active and that all Canadian children have the opportunity to play outside, to play with their friends and to play with teams to foster the formative skills that develop when they are pursuing these physical activities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789063">It would be unfair if all Canadian children did not have the same opportunities in this respect. That is why I think it is important that the federal government step up and continue to perform its role. Active kids are healthy kids. I urge all members to support this motion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5789107">He made some mention of the testimony from the Clerk of the Privy Council at committee last week.

              <ParaText id="5789108">First, the committee has commenced a study. Second, the committee has called the former <Affiliation DbId="214903" Type="96">minister of justice and attorney general of Canada</Affiliation>. Third, the committee has also said that subsequent to hearing testimony, it will revisit the issue as to whether to call subsequent witnesses, and which ones. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5789112">The Clerk of the Privy Council confirmed that there was a sustained and coordinated effort to get the former attorney general to change her mind. The clerk said that the decision was with the former attorney general. She had already made the decision. She said no. She said no. She was asked to overrule an independent prosecutor in the matter of an independent court proceeding, and she said no.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5789116">Mr. Speaker, that is a very excellent question that speaks to the heart of this matter. We only have to look at the chronology to determine that something improper and perhaps even illegal was happening. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789117">The top prosecutor, the independent chief legal person who has the ability to make these determinations, ruled in her independent capacity that SNC-Lavalin did not qualify for one of these new special deals that the Liberals had created. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789118">Many meetings took place between that company's lobbyists and government officials, all throughout meetings with the former attorney general in attempting to get her to change her position, which was to let the independent prosecutor continue on with her work. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789119">At a key meeting in late December, the former principal adviser, Gerald Butts, met with the former attorney general and talked about consequences. Perhaps the most telling detail of all was that after she refused to give in to those demands from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office, the former attorney general was removed from her post. It is impossible to conclude that this pressure was not intended to get a different outcome, because she lost her job for standing up to those in the PMO who were trying to subvert the course of justice.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5789124">Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by saying very clearly that it is in the public interest that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> be a witness at the justice committee and come clean. It is in the public interest that he say yes to this, and it is in the public interest that our colleagues across the floor vote in favour of this motion that we have put forward today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789125">Why is it in the public interest? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789126">I am very proud to sit on the justice committee, and so far we have heard from some witnesses. We have heard from the <Affiliation DbId="245290" Type="96">Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada</Affiliation>, and in that meeting we heard that the minister could not answer any questions because he was bound by solicitor-client privilege. He claimed to be bound by cabinet confidence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789127">He also espoused numerous opinions here in the House as to whether or not something happened regarding undue pressure, or pressure at all, on the minister. However, what I found most interesting is what the witness, the current <Affiliation DbId="245290" Type="96">Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada</Affiliation>, did not tell us in committee but rather affirmed later: It was that when the former attorney general went to cabinet to discuss her side of the story, he recused himself from that cabinet meeting because he did not want to hear what she had to say. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789128">If the current Attorney General did not want to hear what the former attorney general wanted to say, there is significant public interest in knowing exactly what kind of pressure was building on the previous attorney general. Otherwise, why would the current Attorney General be afraid or concerned about being in a conflict position or maybe being in a position where he had a positive obligation to do something on behalf of the Office of the Attorney General? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789129">The second witness of note was the Clerk of the Privy Council. The Clerk of the Privy Council allowed us to gather more facts, and more facts than we thought we were actually going to get in one sense. He certainly did not believe that there was solicitor-client privilege at play. He also went beyond talking about what was alleged to have been said and confirmed for us many things that happened in cabinet, which was very helpful. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789130">The Clerk also told us of a series of meetings that had happened, which was very interesting, because it gave us certain dots to diarize in terms of putting together the story. However, I do not think he gave us all the information. The only person who has all the information is the witness who did not make it onto the list of the justice committee, and that is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789131">What have we heard from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> so far? We have heard only from the Prime Minister in successive press availabilities, wherein his story, as the leader of the opposition pointed out, has changed multiple times. What was interesting about his press conferences as they went on was that we got a little more information. Sometimes solicitor-client privilege applied and sometimes it did not. At the end, he gave minimalistic answers whenever the press wanted to go deeper, understand the issue and get more facts and more context in order to maybe come to a conclusion as to whether or not there was influence, and then he would hide behind and cower under both solicitor-client privilege and sometimes under cabinet confidence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789132"> I will be up front and honest in saying that I do not know whether he actually believed that those two principles were at play when he said those things, because we have seen numerous legal opinions in the press since then. It has been a great time for lawyers in this country, and for social media. There have been numerous legal opinions written with respect to whether solicitor-client privilege applies or even if cabinet confidence applies, which is an important consideration as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789133">Today we are also going to hear from a number of witnesses in committee. In the first tranche of meetings, we are going to have a literature review of what the Shawcross principle is. The usefulness of the deferred prosecution agreement will be discussed as well in the second hour, which is very interesting for lawyers who may want to have debates on those matters. However, the reality is that it does not really illuminate the situation in which we find ourselves, which means utilizing the facts to determine whether or not the Shawcross principle was adhered to. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789134">I will make a very bold prediction that in today's questioning of these witnesses, one of them will say that they simply do not have enough facts in order to render a clear decision on whether or not the Shawcross principle had been violated, because we do not have all the facts. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5789135">Let us look at the meetings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789136"> On September 4, there was a letter to SNC-Lavalin from the director of public prosecutions saying no. On September 17, the Clerk of the Privy Council tells us that he, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the former attorney general had a meeting, that they did discuss the SNC-Lavalin matter and, supposedly, the former attorney general indicated that she would not be changing her mind and that she would not be succumbing to the pressure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789137">How do we know that? The Clerk of the Privy Council told us a story in the justice committee. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has given us bits and bobs of information in press conferences. We have not heard yet from the former attorney general. However, the Prime Minister's testimony is crucial and key in this. There were three people in that meeting. We need to hear from every one of those people in order to ensure we know what happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789138">We fast forward to the December 5 meeting that happened between Gerald Butts, the former principal secretary to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and the former attorney general. Having been honoured to be a former cabinet minister in this place, any meeting like that would have a readout sent back to the Prime Minister. We need to know what was in the readout to the Prime Minister, and only the Prime Minister can tell us that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789139">On December 6, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> sent a letter to SNC-Lavalin and the former attorney general indicating this was all the problem of the attorney general and SNC should speak to her. We need to know what thought process and conversations happened up to the moment when he signed that letter, under his own signature.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789140">There was also a meeting on December 17, again, between the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office and the staff of the former attorney general. Both would send readouts back to their minister and Prime Minister. We need to know what happened there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789141">Finally, on December 18, the Clerk of the Privy Council had a telephone call with the former attorney general. There is no question that he gave a readout to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> after that, because it seems to have formed the basis of a shuffle that happened no more than 20 days later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789142">There is another reason this is in the public interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789143"> Shareholders of SNC-Lavalin have recently contacted a law firm in Windsor, Ontario. They are concerned about the fact that SNC-Lavalin was given notification by the director of public prosecutions on September 4 that she would not be granting a deferred prosecution agreement. However, it was not until October 10 that SNC-Lavalin disclosed this matter. In that intervening time, between September 4 and October 10, shareholders of SNC-Lavalin were not made aware of the fact that the journey to get a deferred prosecution agreement had ended. Why that matters to us is the following.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789144">Who in the Prime Minister's Office, what cabinet minister, or even did the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> give assurances to SNC-Lavalin that it would not have to disclose a material fact to its shareholders because they were going to sort it all out? An investigation will be going on there. This is not a political matter. While I respect the ethics office and the justice committee, we are far beyond that. We are now in the world of concerns about whether there is true representation and timely disclosure given by the company on a matter that could possibly take away 15% of its revenues. That is a material fact for shareholders to know. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789145">From September 4 in writing until October 10 in writing, no material disclosure happened by SNC-Lavalin on this point. We will not rest until the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> appears before the justice committee and tells us the truth. Canadians deserve it, shareholders deserve it and we deserve it as an institution.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="242093" Type="18">Mr. Arif Virani (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada and to the Minister of Democratic Institutions, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5789163">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to some of the matters raised in the motion of the member opposite. I want to commence my statements by two comments, which are simply to underscore the important contributions that have been made to government and the Government of Canada by two very distinct Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789164">First, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">Vancouver Granville</Affiliation> has served as a minister and attorney general as well as the minister of Veterans Affairs, and has made terrific and incredible contributions. I would reiterate my personal alarm about the comments that were made about the member for Vancouver Granville and the attacks that were made about her and her character. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789165">Second, are the contributions made by the former principal secretary to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, his belief in public service and dedicating his work to the cause of all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789166">We know two processes are already under way to investigate the alleged allegations referenced in the motion. First, the House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights began hearing witnesses on this issue on Thursday, February 21, in response to a motion that was initiated. Second, the Ethics Commissioner is conducting an investigation, as we speak. That was also initiated by members of the opposition. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789167">There is every reason to believe that these two mechanisms, one composed of Canada's elected representatives and one representing a non-partisan perspective, are up to the task of considering the very questions that are being asked by Canadians and by the members on the other side of the aisle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789168">With that in mind, it would be beneficial to begin by discussing the rules, responsibilities and powers of the justice committee in its review of this matter in addition to what the committee has already heard and what witnesses it will hear from.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="5789169"> As with other large deliberative assemblies, the House of Commons has taken advantage of the greater flexibility available in committees to carry out functions that can be better performed in smaller groups, including the examination of witnesses and detailed consideration of legislation, estimates and technical matters. Committee work provides detailed information to parliamentarians on issues of concern to the electorate and, as we well know, often provokes important public debate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789170">In addition, because committees interact directly with the public, they provide an immediate and visible conduit between elected representatives and Canadians. Committees are extensions of the House, created by either standing or special orders, and are limited in their powers by the authority delegated to them. For House of Commons committees, the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs establishes a list of members of the various standing committees at the start of each session and during the course of a session, if necessary. This list takes effect once it is approved by the House. As stipulated in the Standing Orders of the House of Commons, most standing committees have 10 members. Party representation on committees reflects the party standings in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789171"> Committees can gather the information necessary for their studies in a number of ways, including by hearing testimony during meetings, accepting briefs and written opinions, requesting the production of documents, organizing round tables and visiting locations. Most often, committees gather information on a particular subject by hearing from witnesses and consulting briefs. With the exception of standing joint committees and certain standing committees, the Standing Orders set out a general mandate for all standing committees. They are empowered to study and report to the House on all matters relating to the mandate, organization, management and operation of the departments assigned to them by the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789172">More specifically, they can review and report on the statute law relating to the departments assigned to them; the program and policy objectives of those departments and the effectiveness of their implementation thereof; the immediate, medium and long-term expenditure plans of those departments and the effectiveness of the implementation thereof; and an analysis of the relative success of those departments in meeting their objectives.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5789173"> In addition to this general mandate, other matters are routinely referred by the House to its standing committees, such as bills, estimates, order in council appointments, documents tabled in the House pursuant to statute, and specific matters which the House wishes to have studied. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789174">In each case, the House chooses the most appropriate committee on the basis of its mandate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789175">The House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights has the power to review and report on the policies, programs, and expenditure plans of the Department of Justice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789176">As hon. members know, the department has the mandate to support the dual roles of the Minister of Justice and the Attorney General of Canada, the chief law officer of the Crown. The committee also has the power to study the policies, programs and legislation of the following entities: the Canadian Human Rights Commission, the Office of the Commissioner for Federal Judicial Affairs Canada, the Supreme Court of Canada, the Courts Administration Service, the Administrative Tribunals Support Service of Canada and the Public Prosecution Service of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789177"> In particular, the committee may review proposed amendments to federal legislation relating to certain aspects of the criminal law, family law, human rights law, and the administration of justice, notably with respect to the following statutes: the Criminal Code, the Youth Criminal Justice Act, the Divorce Act, the Civil Marriage Act, the Canadian Human Rights Act, the Judges Act, the Courts Administration Service Act and the Supreme Court Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789178">The Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights may also undertake studies on subjects related to its mandate, either as referred to it by the House of Commons or on its own initiative. For example, they recently conducted a study on juror mental health, and prior to that, they conducted a study on human trafficking in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789179">In the course of a study, the committee holds public meetings, considers evidence from witnesses, and reviews written submissions and other authoritative documents. In the case of their human trafficking study, they also travelled across Canada to hold private sessions with witnesses who were uncomfortable testifying in a public forum. This enabled them to hear from witnesses that they otherwise might not have been able to hear from but whose testimony was crucial to their study.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789180">At the conclusion of a study, the committee usually reports its findings and makes recommendations. The committee may request a government response within 120 days.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="5789181">As we know, the committee met on Thursday, February 21, and heard from the hon. <Affiliation DbId="245290" Type="96">Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada</Affiliation>, the deputy minister of justice and deputy attorney general of Canada, Madame Nathalie Drouin, as well as the Clerk of the Privy Council, Mr. Michael Wernick. All of these witnesses provided helpful information at committee to assist it, and Canadians generally, to understand the scenario addressed in the member's motion we are debating today, in addition to the roles and responsibilities of the Attorney General of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789182">For example, when asked if it would be appropriate for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and officials to discuss the matter in question with the Attorney General of Canada, the <Affiliation DbId="245292" Type="21">Attorney General</Affiliation>, in his testimony, confirmed, “Those kinds of conversations would be appropriate”. Mr. Wernick, as Clerk of the Privy Council, reiterated this view in his own testimony later the same day. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789183">When asked about conversations with cabinet colleagues in his role as <Affiliation DbId="245290" Type="96">Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada</Affiliation> and whether they were appropriate, the Attorney General of Canada answered, “Absolutely”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789184">As the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has indicated, he is seeking the counsel of the <Affiliation DbId="245292" Type="21">Attorney General of Canada</Affiliation> regarding the issue of solicitor-client privilege. The Attorney General has assured Canadians that he is seized with the urgency of this matter and is seeking the best approach to provide transparency to Canadians and fairness to the former attorney general in a way that does not compromise solicitor-client or litigation privilege. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5789185">To that end, solicitor-client privilege is an exceedingly important part of Canada's legal system and should only be waived in the appropriate circumstances. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789186">It is a protection that allows lawyers across this country, many of whom find seats in this very chamber, to engage on the toughest issues known in law and provide their clients with candid and comprehensive advice. This includes the current <Affiliation DbId="245292" Type="21">Attorney General of Canada</Affiliation> who is the government's lawyer. The Attorney General must be allowed to provide that advice to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and would be unable to do so in a candid and comprehensive manner if solicitor-client privilege were waived.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789187">As the former attorney general, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">Vancouver Granville</Affiliation>, has stated, the issue of solicitor-client privilege is complex and layered. That is why the current <Affiliation DbId="245292" Type="21">Attorney General</Affiliation> is studying carefully the very best approach to provide transparency to Canadians and fairness to the former attorney general in a way that does not compromise solicitor-client privilege or litigation privilege, which is important to underscore as there are currently not one but two pending litigation matters involving SNC-Lavalin before Canadian courts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789188"> Madame Nathalie Drouin, the deputy minister of justice and deputy attorney general of Canada, helpfully explained in her testimony before the committee last week that “The Attorney General is supported by the DPP, the director of public prosecutions. Please note that the DPP is also a deputy attorney general of Canada. The DPP is responsible for initiating and conducting federal criminal prosecutions on behalf of the Crown.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789189">During his important testimony before the committee last week, the Clerk of the Privy Council, Mr. Michael Wernick, whom I previously referenced, indicated that on February 12 the director of public prosecutions issued the following statement, which can be found on the director's website: “I am confident that our prosecutors, in this and every other case, exercise their discretion independently and free from any political or partisan consideration.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789190">The testimony of Mr. Michael Wernick was especially helpful in light of his decades of service as a senior public servant under both Conservative and Liberal governments. As the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has stated, this, “leaves him well positioned to understand what our institutions are grounded in and make sure we are doing the right things as a government” and “He is someone we need to heed very carefully when he chooses to express himself publicly”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789191">Mr. Wernick went on at that committee. I will reiterate it for the purposes of the record of today's debate. He stated, “If you boil it down for Canadians as to what is going on here with the facts that we have and all of the facts that I know from my participation in meetings and conversations, we are discussing lawful advocacy”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789192">Again, I am quoting Mr. Michael Wernick, the Clerk of the Privy Council of Canada, the most senior civil servant in this country. He went on to say that his view “very firmly” was that the conversations with the former minister of justice and attorney general of Canada “were entirely appropriate, lawful, legal.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789193">We know that after the justice committee's in-camera meeting of February 19 of this year, the committee members announced that they will be calling the former minister of justice and attorney general of Canada, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">Vancouver Granville</Affiliation>, as well as several academics to appear before the committee and give testimony. Those hearings are expected to take place this very week. The committee may well then decide to hear from more witnesses, as is its jurisdiction and its purview. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789194">Under the Liberal government, committees are masters of their own agenda. Committees of this House do exemplary work. Everyone in this chamber recognizes that because everyone in this chamber, save for cabinet members, participates in that committee work. We are confident that the committee meetings will continue to be thoroughly and fairly conducted and will provide Canadians with the answers and information that they seek.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789195">In the remaining portion of my time, I want to address the Ethics Commissioner's investigation. I turn briefly now to the study that will be conducted by the Ethics Commissioner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789196">Under the Conflict of Interest Act, a member of the Senate or House of Commons who has reasonable grounds to believe that a public officer holder, which includes the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, has contravened the act may in writing request that the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner examine the matter. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5789197">In conducting this kind of investigation, the commissioner has many powers. First is the power to summon witnesses and require them, first, “to give evidence—orally or in writing—on oath” or “on affirmation”, and second, “to produce any documents and things that the Commissioner considers necessary.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789198">For the purposes of enforcing these powers, the commissioner has the same powers as a court of record in civil cases. The subject of the complaint also has the opportunity to make submissions to the commissioner.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="5789199"> The commissioner is required to provide the Prime Minister with a report setting out the facts in question, as well as the commissioner's analysis and conclusions in relation to the request made by a parliamentarian. The report is to be provided to the person who made the request, the public office holder who is the subject of the request, and the public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789200">The commissioner may not include in the report any information that he or she is required to keep confidential, unless the information is essential for the purposes of establishing the grounds for any conclusion in a report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789201">As I have explained, these two processes are already under way. Both are investigating the allegations raised by the motion that is before us today. I am entirely confident that these two processes will be thoroughly and fairly conducted and will provide Canadians with the answers and information they seek. There is every reason to believe that these two groups are up to the task of considering the questions that are being asked.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5789202">Mr. Speaker, again, I am very pleased to congratulate the <Affiliation DbId="242093" Type="18">hon. parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> for the quality of his French and all the effort he puts in. I really appreciate it.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="5789203">I am sure that the parliamentary secretary wants to get the whole truth, as do we. For this to happen, the key figures in the Liberal SNC-Lavalin scandal must be able to testify.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789204">The member will agree that the Liberals initially refused to allow the former attorney general to testify. The Liberals finally reconsidered in response to public pressure, and it is very likely that the former attorney general will appear tomorrow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789205">On Thursday, the committee heard from Canada's top public servant, the Clerk of the Privy Council. His testimony shed a new light on the Liberal SNC-Lavalin scandal. We learned that the minute the director of public prosecutions informed SNC-Lavalin of her decision on September 4, SNC-Lavalin started lobbying the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789206">The Prime Minister and the former attorney general met on September 17, and the Prime Minister's principal secretary and the former attorney general met on December 5. On December 19, Canada's top public servant called the former attorney general directly. These three events were an attempt to exert pressure regarding the Liberal SNC-Lavalin scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789207">After the former attorney general was pressured by the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister's principal secretary and the top-ranking public servant, probably the three most powerful people in the Canadian government, would the best way to get to the bottom of this story not be for the Prime Minister himself to appear before a parliamentary committee to clearly explain to Canadians what happened?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5789209">As part of this debate, he first mentioned that the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights made the important decision to hear from a number of people, including the former minister of justice and attorney general of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789210">Second, he talked about the testimony Mr. Wernick gave before the committee a few days ago. Mr. Wernick gave the same answer as the current Attorney General, namely that the conversations were appropriate. The clerk indicated that those kinds of conversations take place between ministers on a daily basis and said that not only are they appropriate, but that the Prime Minister clearly said it was up to the justice minister to make that decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789211">That is the kind of testimony the committee has heard. The members on this side of the House believe that we need to let the committee conduct its own investigation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5789212">Mr. Speaker, the <Affiliation DbId="242093" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> spoke about the importance of two processes that are under way: the first, the justice committee; and the second, the review inquiry by the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789213">At the justice committee, he talked about how that committee is “master of its own agenda”, but of course the Liberals have a majority on that committee. Canadians need to know that when we tried to get more witnesses to attend, including Gerry Butts, Mr. Bouchard and Jessica Prince, they voted that down, saying that we should wait and see what the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> has to say.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789214">As to what she can say, the new <Affiliation DbId="245292" Type="21">Attorney General</Affiliation> came and said that solicitor-client privilege is very complex, and the member just said today that we are still studying that, etc. It is hard for us to understand that, since the clerk himself, after 30-some years of experience, said in an answer to me that he had concluded that solicitor-client privilege did not even apply in these circumstances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789215">It is very murky as to how the justice committee is going to get to the bottom of this. As for the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner, we know very well that the complaint is about section 9, where a decision of another person to improperly further another person's private interests is at stake.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789216">This may not even apply in these circumstances at all based on past practice.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5789218">Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite for his contributions to today's debate, his contributions generally in this chamber, as well as his significant contributions at the justice committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789219">In terms of responding to the point just raised, first of all, it is absolutely correct that there is a majority of government members at that committee, as there is at the majority of committees in this chamber. That is set, as I mentioned in my opening statement, pursuant to the rules of the chamber, which is that the representation in committees reflects representation in the chamber.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789220">What I would indicate to the member opposite, and he would know this very well, as I mentioned earlier that there are many lawyers in this chamber, is that Mr. Wernick gave a response in committee. That response speaks for itself. However, the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> has said it is “layered” and complex when you assess issues of privilege and confidence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789221">There is not just one issue at stake; there are actually four issues. The first is solicitor-client privilege, and we have heard the member opposite and Mr. Wernick in that regard. The second is the duty that any lawyer owes to their client. The third is the issue of cabinet confidence. The fourth is the issue of litigation privilege, and, as I mentioned earlier, there are two ongoing court cases. All four of those components need to be assessed, evaluated and analyzed before a robust and accurate understanding can be made in terms of what applies here and what can be disclosed to the public.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5789222">Mr. Speaker, we keep hearing from members in this House that committees are independent. That is simply not true. At every committee of this House, whip's staff are in attendance to make sure that members are in compliance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789223">We also have a situation where, on February 13, Liberal members of the justice committee openly admitted that an office of a member of the government, the <Affiliation DbId="224669" Type="4">House leader</Affiliation>, openly coordinated with the Liberal members on the appearance of witnesses in front of the committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789224">Clearly, committees of this House are under the thumb of the government. That is why we need an order of this House to ensure that the committee hears from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. I would remind members of this House that, in my view, it is a violation of parliamentary privilege, a violation of members' rights, for any member of the government, of the cabinet, to even communicate with a member of the committee about the business of the committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789225">I would quote from page 265 of the 24th edition of Erskine May, <I>Parliamentary Practice</I>, where it says, “the chairman of a select committee...had exceeded the bounds of propriety in participating in a conversation with a government whip about matters within that committee's remit..”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789226">We are far from that independence of a committee in this place. That is why we need this order of the House to be adopted, to ensure that the committee does its work and holds the government accountable and gets to the bottom of this mess. It is clear to members of this House and to me that the committee is under the control of the majority, under the control of the <Affiliation DbId="224669" Type="4">government House leader</Affiliation>'s office and the whip's office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789227">That is why I encourage Liberal members who are not part of the government to support this motion. I encourage six or seven of them to join with us to support this motion to ensure that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is brought in front of committee to get to the bottom of this matter.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5789228">Mr. Speaker, I have a few responses to the intervention by the member opposite. First of all, the statement he is referring to, which arose from the earliest iteration of the justice committee hearings during the constituency week, was clarified by the member for <Affiliation DbId="214526" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> in French later on during those very same hearings. I urge the member opposite to consult that part of Hansard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789229">I will confess that I have a tremendous amount of respect for the member opposite and his contributions in this chamber. However, I find it a little particular, and perhaps even a bit rich, for that comment to be coming from that member, because the track record of the previous government was to completely manhandle and manipulate committees, using parliamentary secretaries such as me for that purpose. In fact, that is precisely why we campaigned on a platform to change the role of parliamentary secretaries and why they are much more constrained in their behaviour. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5789235">Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the motion before us to compel the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada to appear before the justice committee to answer questions in this affair, which has grown and changed over the last couple of weeks in quite dramatic ways.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789236">I would like to begin by indicating what I would like to say in my remarks by way of outline. I would like to provide a bit of history about how we arrived here and the changing narrative of the government side. I would then like to talk about the role of the independent Attorney General and how precious that is in our democracy. I would like to try to then refute the argument that somehow everything is fine because the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner is going to have carriage of this. Lastly, I would like to talk about the issue of deferred prosecution agreements or remediation agreements, which have been put into the Criminal Code quite recently, only coming into force in September of last year and which are at the centre of this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789237">With that in mind, I would like to talk about the sequence of events that has led us here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789238">A Globe and Mail story reported that there apparently had been pressure put on the former attorney general  in respect of a criminal prosecution. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister's</Affiliation> immediate response, and there were many, was that he did not direct her to do a particular thing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789239">That wording is important, because I think it is common ground between the government and the opposition that directing an independent attorney general to do something with a criminal matter is wrong. It is in fact unconstitutional, violating one of the key constitutional conventions of our democracy, and that is that we have the right to an independent, not political, decision-maker when a person is going to be subject to criminal charges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789240">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> started by saying that he did not direct her to do certain things. However, that was never the story in the first place. The story was that she was pressured to do certain things, and I will come back to that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789241">Then, of course, the clerk appeared last week to say that there was vigorous debate, but there was simply lawful advocacy, no inappropriate pressure. I will develop why this matters in a moment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789242">There is a convention, a decision, called the Shawcross principle, which was generated in 1951 by a labour attorney general in the United Kingdom. It talks about the line that cannot be crossed. That is now a part of Canadian law and is referred to as the Shawcross principle. That line is that it is absolutely appropriate, and in fact sometimes very desirable, to have an attorney general discuss matters with his or her cabinet colleagues, but the final decision has to be his or her decision alone. The question before us is whether or not there was pressure that crossed that line, which, of course, comes to what happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789243">On September 4, an independent person called the director of public prosecutions communicated to a company called SNC-Lavalin that there would not be a deferred prosecution agreement, that she was going to proceed in her decision with a prosecution of this matter in criminal court. Thereafter, it appears that the former attorney general, who has the ability under the statute to reverse that, to give a direction to that person, decided not to budge. I do not think the law even applies here, as I will describe in a moment. However, even if the law did apply in these circumstances, it is not my judgment that there ought to be a deferred prosecution agreement in these circumstances. It is her decision and her decision alone. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789244">Then what happened was that on September 17, this issue came up in cabinet with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. We have heard testimony to confirm that. On December 5, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s powerful chief of staff, Gerry Butts, confirmed that there was a meeting at the Chateau Laurier where this issue was discussed again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789245">We must remember that the decision of the independent director of public prosecutions had already been made and it was not to be changed, as said by the attorney general.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789246">On December 18, there was a meeting between Katie Telford and Gerry Butts, of the Prime Minister's Office, and the chief of staff to the former attorney general on this topic.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5789247">On December 19, the Clerk of the Privy Council, the most powerful public servant in the country, Mr. Wernick, told us at committee that he needed to “check in” with her to give her context in a phone call. Then there was Christmas, as usual, in December, and then there was a cabinet shuffle. Mr. Brison decided that he would leave, as we all know. There were only a couple of people affected by that cabinet shuffle, one of whom was the former attorney general, who was removed from that position and, as everyone knows, shortly thereafter resigned from cabinet. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789248">The issue is whether there was inappropriate pressure upon the former attorney general. If there was, there are those who would argue that there was an obstruction of justice. When there is interference, reasonably perceived by an objective person, with the administration of justice, that is obstruction. It is a serious criminal charge, and we need to get to the bottom of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789249">The question then becomes, was there inappropriate pressure? Was that line I talked about crossed? Let us examine it for a moment. First, it would appear to a reasonable person that the former attorney general did feel that this pressure existed. Imagine how many times this issue came up after the final decision was made. Imagine how many different people, both in the bureaucracy at the highest level and in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office at the highest level, tried to speak to her about this issue. “What part of 'no' don't you understand?”, I hear her say. I was not there. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789250">The Clerk of the Privy Council felt that he could advise us that, in fact, there was no inappropriate pressure. With the greatest of respect to an honourable senior public servant of great experience and service to Canada, how does he know? Was he at every one of those meetings? There were 50 meetings with people from SNC-Lavalin. There were 18 meetings with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office alone. He was not there, nor was he there when meetings with the former attorney general were taking place, out of earshot, at the Chateau Laurier or who knows where. With great respect, first, he does not know, and second, he is not the former attorney general and cannot tell us what she felt and inferred from that conduct.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789251">Let us look at the objective standard of whether this line was crossed. There were so many different people and so many different conversations and so much relentless advocacy to change a position. What about the consequences for not doing so? She is gone. The government does not like to hear the word “fired”, so I will say that she was removed from that role. I guess there were consequences, some would infer, from that undue pressure. I would, but I want to hear from her.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789252">That takes us to the justice committee. The parliamentary secretary made much of the fact that this independent master of its own procedure at committee is going to get to the bottom of this. Excuse me, but we tried to do so. We tried to get other people than simply the former attorney general to come to committee, and we were swatted down like flies. They said that maybe after they heard from her, they might allow us to hear from the other people, the only other people who can tell the other side of the story. One would think they would want that if they felt there was nothing going on here, but they do not seem to want that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789253">Maybe there is another theory. Maybe the straw that broke the camel's back in the mind of our former attorney general was that the government continued to have a yawning gap between the rhetoric and the reality of indigenous law reform. It is no secret that the former attorney general was pushing hard on that. She made a number of speeches that seemed to suggest that she was unhappy with that. Frankly, maybe this clumsy effort to pressure her in this matter and then to have her removed was the straw that broke the camel's back. I simply do not know.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789254">We heard this morning from the hon. parliamentary secretary, and from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> on many occasions and from the Clerk of the Privy Council at committee, that we should not worry. They are going to have an inquiry by the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner, and that is going to be good enough. With all due respect, it will not be good enough, because it is almost certain that there will not be anything found to be wrong in these circumstances, not because of the facts but because of the wording of section 9 of the Conflict of Interest Act, under which the commissioner has said he will do an investigation. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5789255">Mr. Dion, the investigator, said that he has “reason to believe that a possible contravention of section 9 [of the act] may have occurred”. Section 9 prohibits a public office holder from seeking to influence a decision by another person so as to improperly further another person's private interest, which is what he said he is going to look at. However, here is the punchline: All the other cases that have ever been decided by former commissioner Mary Dawson and others have said that there is nothing in the act to suggest that political interests are to be included in the concept of private interests. If it is money, okay, but if it is other things, no. Therefore, there is very little likelihood that it will lead Canadians any closer to the truth, which we must have in these circumstances. Frankly, it is not about the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and interests. It is about whether there was interference with the independent role of the former attorney general.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789256">What about these deferred prosecution agreements, which was what was at stake here? I have to say that there is a great deal of griping as to whether these agreements would even be applicable in these circumstances. I have mentioned that they have not been used, because they are brand new. They were put into an omnibus budget bill, which kind of sounds like the Harper government. At the end of a big budget bill, we had a couple of sections thrown in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789257"> I was on the justice committee. We had a half hour or an afternoon on this particular section, and I can assure members that the words “SNC-Lavalin” were never mentioned. We had no idea that this was what was at issue. These things were described as important changes to deal with white collar crime. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789258">Deferred prosecution agreements do have a role to play in our system, but they may not be applicable here, because there are certain conditions set out in the Criminal Code before they can apply. For example, one has to voluntarily disclose wrongdoing, admit corporate responsibility, make reparations to people, and so forth. Maybe there was just no way this square peg could fit into that round hole. It may just be that there was no way these even applied. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789259">What would we expect an attorney general to do? “I would love to help you, but in fact, the law doesn't allow it”. The punchline here is that under the corrupt foreign practices legislation Canada has, if the defence says that it is going to be harmful to our national economic interest, it is not applicable. The whole lobby by SNC-Lavalin, this gigantic 50-times-they-met-people lobby, was to try to tell us about the national economic interest. Therefore, for a number of reasons, people are wondering whether the former attorney general was being asked to do something that was simply not possible or was, in fact, illegal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789260">What were they trying to do if that was the case? Were they trying to get something done that was illegal, or were they trying to get the law changed so we could fix it? Today we read in the The Globe and Mail something that may be the answer. If one is found guilty of bribery or fraud abroad, one cannot do business with the Government of Canada for 10 years. However, do not worry, it appears that help is on the way. We are going to change that and say that we may give some discretion to some public servant to kind of change that 10 years to maybe six months, a slap on the wrist or something. If we cannot do it one way, if we cannot pressure an Attorney General to perhaps change things, then we will find another way to fix it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789261">This is serious. Transparency International reported in its 2018 report that Canada is lagging its fellow OECD countries on this issue. We are not doing the job. We have “regressed”, to use the word it put in its 2018 report. Therefore, it is serious. At the OECD and other places, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and Canada have talked about how we are right behind efforts to get at international white collar crime, bribery abroad and the like and that we were with them all the way. Well, maybe this was just another broken promise, and maybe that is what the former attorney general was thinking when she resigned. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789262">The Liberals promised modest deficits when they ran, but they broke that promise. In my part of the world, they promised to redo the process that gave us this dreadful project that is going to do serious harm to southern resident killer whales and the indigenous way of life on the coast. They promised to “redo” that. He came to my riding and said that. I was there. However, he did not do that.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5789263">The Liberals promised to change the electoral system. My colleagues will remember that. I think it was several hundred times we heard the promise that the last election would be the last one under the first-past-the-post system. Of course, the Liberals changed their minds on that as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789264">However, the promise I think Canadians have the right to care about the most, the one that was probably the most important, if one were to stand back from it, in a democracy, and the one that certainly got my attention, was the commitment to openness and accountability. I was completely in favour of that. I did a lot of work in the earlier part of my life on freedom of information. I believed the Liberals. I wanted to believe the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789265"> “It is time to shine more light on government”, it said in the Liberal 2015 campaign program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789266"> “Openness and transparency will be our constant companions”, the Prime Minister said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789267">I would like to have a little openness and transparency at the justice committee. I would like to have an opportunity to hear from the protagonists in this important debate, the people in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office and the former attorney general.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789268">I can tell members that I am not very optimistic, because Mr. Wernick, who has been 37 years in the public service, concluded, in an answer to a question I posed, that solicitor-client privilege does not apply here. It is not about litigation privilege. Solicitor-client privilege is about when a lawyer gives advice to a client and has to go to the grave with any secrets he or she hears in advising that client. Lots of lawyers say that it is simply not applicable in these circumstances, because we are not talking about advice. We are talking about whether a person was browbeaten in the exercise of her authority as the former attorney general. That is the issue here. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789269">With regard to litigation privilege, there are two lawsuits. One is a case in Montreal, I believe, which has to do with fraud and bribery. It has nothing to do with what is going on here, nothing, not a thing. It does not talk about litigation and public privilege and the Attorney General. The second case is what most lawyers who do administrative law would call a Hail Mary pass. Believe it or not, SNC-Lavalin is seeking a judicial review of the prosecutorial discretion of the independent director of public prosecutions because she made a mistake in how she exercised her discretion. If ever there was a Hail Mary pass, it is that one. Those are the two cases the government wants to hide behind on the basis of litigation and public privilege.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789270">Let us just review this. First, Mr. Wernick says that there is no such thing in these circumstances. I agree with him. Second, we have no advice to the government in the circumstances at all. That is not at issue. Third, the government refers to litigation privilege in two cases that have literally nothing to do with this. I am very proud of our justice committee chair, who concluded that any effort to use the sub judice rule in that regard would not likely be of any merit. I do not see that as an issue at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789271">I know that we can get caught up in the weeds here. I know that we can get right into the specifics while Canadians wonder what the big deal is. This is not climate. This is not the housing crisis. This is not the opioid crisis. However, this is our democracy. This is about whether we live in a banana republic or not. Do we live in a country where we respect the rule of law and the independence of the Attorney General, or do we not? Are we prepared to take a risk and not thoroughly investigate whether there was improper interference, at the highest level, with the role of an Attorney General of Canada? I am not saying that there was. I do not know. I was not there. However, the Liberals would use their majority in the justice committee to not allow us to find that out, to hide behind solicitor-client privilege. The <Affiliation DbId="245292" Type="21">Attorney General</Affiliation> could not tell us what it was or what was so complicated. He could not tell us who could waive it. Read the testimony.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789272">Canadians deserve answers. We need to get to the bottom of this. It is important for democracy. It is important for the House of Commons. It is important for Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5789275">Mr. Speaker, the first point made by the member for <Affiliation DbId="214334" Type="2">Sackville—Preston—Chezzetcook</Affiliation> was that ministers of the Crown could share information and discuss it with others. As I said in my remarks, I not only think it is right, but that it is necessary for an attorney general to speak with his or her cabinet colleagues and others about the issues before that attorney general. In fact, Lord Simon in England said that one would be a fool not to in many circumstances, and I agree.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789276"> However, the role of a cabinet member minister of justice is very distinct from the role of an attorney general. In places like England, he or she would not even sit in the cabinet because of the concerns we see today. Therefore, proper discussion is fine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789277">The member pointed out that the Clerk of the Privy Council, Mr. Wernick, said that there was proper discussion. First, he was not at all of those meetings, and he could not have been as there have been so many, with the former attorney general, and he acknowledged that. Second, he is not the arbiter of whether there was proper discussion or whether the line I referred to was crossed. Third, looking at the facts as we know them, an objective, reasonable person would say that with all this pressure coming from so many different people it looks like there was improper pressure.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5789279">I would argue nothing is more important than the constitutional order that governs the country. Tax policy comes and goes, climate change policy gets changed government to government, programs come and go, but what endures and has endured in the country for at least 150 years is our constitutional order. The matter in front of the House today concerns some very grave allegations between the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the former attorney general.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789280">I want to add a point to the excellent points made by the member for <Affiliation DbId="214384" Type="2">Victoria</Affiliation>, which is about the Shawcross doctrine. The Shawcross doctrine, which is the constitutional convention adopted by all attorneys general of the country, makes it clear that it is appropriate for an attorney general to consult, to solicit advice from her cabinet colleagues, but not the other way around. In other words, under that doctrine, it is improper for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> or any member of the cabinet to approach an attorney general in respect of a criminal prosecution, unprompted, and ask that attorney general do something or even provide advice. The doctrine makes it clear that it is an attorney general's right to consult and solicit opinions from fellow cabinet colleagues, but not the other way around.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789281"> As the former attorney general of the Province of Ontario, Michael Bryant, has said, it is improper for a cabinet colleague, including the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> or his staff, to approach an attorney general unprompted to talk about a criminal prosecution. If the House and its committees cannot call the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to a committee to give a full account of what actually happened, it demonstrates to Canadians that this institution and its committees are not up to the task of holding checks and balances on prime ministerial power.</ParaText>

They might be right that there is nothing here.

              <ParaText id="5789298">As each day passes, it is becoming clearer and clearer that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is up to his eyeballs in this sordid affair. With each day, it seems there is a new version of events from the Prime Minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789299"> When The Globe and Mail article was first published, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> hoped he could wash his hands clean of the entire matter by issuing a blanket denial. When that was not going to cut it, the Prime Minister gave a carefully crafted legal response, which stated that the decision was the former attorney general's and the former attorney general's alone. Then he said that the fact the former attorney general was still in cabinet spoke for itself. Well, the former attorney general immediately resigned from cabinet following that statement. So much for that explanation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789300">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> then stated that there was no pressure exerted on the former attorney general, until last Thursday, when the Clerk of the Privy Council, Michael Wernick, appeared before our committee and admitted that, in fact, there was pressure. Wernick said that we should not worry, because there was no inappropriate pressure, as if there is a distinction between appropriate pressure and inappropriate pressure. The fact is that any pressure exerted on the former attorney general is entirely inappropriate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789301">In that regard, I would like to make reference to the late Justice Rosenberg and his dissertation on the independence of the office of Attorney General, wherein he summarizes the Shawcross doctrine. Justice Rosenberg stated, “responsibility for the decision is that of the Attorney General alone; the government is not to put pressure on him or her.” Period, no pressure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789302">What we are also learning, as a result of the testimony of Mr. Wernick, is that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s version of events, his explanation about what happened, is simply untrue. The Prime Minister said that it was the attorney general's decision alone and that there was no pressure. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789303">In fact, it turns out that the former attorney general did make a decision, and she unambiguously communicated that decision to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> on September 17. Her decision was that she would not overturn the decision of the direction of public prosecutions not to enter into a deferred prosecution agreement with SNC-Lavalin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789304">One would expect that upon this decision being conveyed to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, that Prime Minister, out of respect for the former attorney general, out of respect for the independence of the office of Attorney General and the sanctity of that independence, would have left it at that and accepted the decision. However, that is not what happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789305">What happened following September 17, when the former attorney general announced to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> her decision, was a concerted campaign, orchestrated and coordinated by the Prime Minister, through his surrogates, to change the former attorney general's mind. In that regard, it is important we go through some of the important timelines.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="30">(1330)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5789306">We know that on December 5, the former attorney general met with Gerald Butts, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s principal secretary and top political adviser, to discuss—guess what? It was SNC-Lavalin. On September 17, the decision had been made. Nearly three months later, the Prime Minister's top political adviser is talking to the former attorney general about that decision. When the former attorney general did not appear to bow to Mr. Butts, we learn that Mr. Butts and Katie Telford, the Prime Minister's chief of staff, hauled the former attorney general's chief of staff before them to discuss yet again the SNC-Lavalin matter and the matter of a deferred prosecution agreement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789307">Then to make it ever so clear that they were not satisfied with the decision of the former attorney general not to intervene, the Clerk of the Privy Council, Mr. Wernick, on December 19, met with the Prime Minister. Following that meeting, he saw fit to pick up the phone and, as he put it, “check in on the SNC-Lavalin file” with the former attorney general. He further stated, “I conveyed to her that a lot of her colleagues and the Prime Minister were quite anxious about what they were hearing and reading”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789308">He said “quite anxious”. I thought a decision had already been made. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> says it is her decision and her decision alone, that there was no pressure, yet what we learned is that following that decision, there were meetings involving the Prime Minister, his chief of staff, his principal secretary and the Clerk of the Privy Council. The Prime Minister can say with a straight face that the decision was hers and hers alone to make and that there was no pressure; it is an insult to Canadians that the Prime Minister would have the audacity to say that in the face of that chronology.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789309">However, it gets worse from the public interest standpoint. As soon as the Clerk of the Privy Council expressed the anxiousness of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the former attorney general went on vacation. It was Christmastime and the new year. I think she was in Bali, and before she could make it back to Ottawa, she had a call from the Prime Minister to come back to Ottawa. When she came back, she found out that she was going to be fired as the Attorney General, and she was. At the first opportunity, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> fired her.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789310"> He said it was her decision and her decision alone to make. What we are learning is that there was only one decision that the Prime Minister would accept, which was to overrule the director of public prosecutions. The only decision the Prime Minister was prepared to accept was to interfere in an independent criminal prosecution, and until that decision was made, the Prime Minister did not care to what lengths he would go or the lengths that he would instruct his officials to go in interfering with the independence of the office of the Attorney General, and that is a very, very serious matter. That is highly problematic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789311">Quite frankly, it is time for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to come clean. It is time for the Prime Minister to be transparent. It is time for the Prime Minister to provide the answers that Canadians deserve. That is precisely what our motion seeks to do. If the Prime Minister has nothing to hide, then he should come before a committee, be put under oath—with the consequence, by the way, of perjury—and let the sunshine come in.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5789324">Mr. Speaker, we are here today with a motion calling upon the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada to testify under oath as to what he knew or what his role was in the SNC-Lavalin affair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789325">For those who are watching, who may have heard about this over the last couple of weeks, I want to break down what happened. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789326">SNC-Lavalin is a Montreal-based company. Its description is that it provides “engineering, procurement and construction services”. It has a lot of employees in the Montreal area. It has won a lot of major taxpayer-funded, multi-million-dollar contracts from the federal government, so there are a lot of votes at stake and there is a lot of profit at stake here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789327">In 2015, the RCMP laid charges against this company. The charges alleged that the company offered bribes worth $47.7 million to Libyan officials, and Moammar Gadhafi's son was named in the court documents, I believe. The company is also alleged to have defrauded Libyan public agencies of approximately $129 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789328"> Recently we found out that the RCMP has laid out a bribery scheme here in Canada with the company, involving the $127-million Jacques Cartier Bridge contract. In this case, a federal official pleaded guilty last year to accepting more than $2.3 million worth of payments from this company. What is the cost of doing business here?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789329"> In 2015, the RCMP said, “Corruption of foreign officials undermines good governance and sustainable economic development.” This is a huge deal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789330">Fast-forward to this year. The company—this very wealthy, well-funded company—went on the lobbying spree to end all lobbying sprees. Imagine American-style lobbyists. It was a full court press on the government, on everybody. There was meeting after meeting with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office. They would not take no for an answer, because the company wanted to get out of this. That is the motivation here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789331">Why? It is because if SNC-Lavalin is convicted, the company would not be able to bid on federal contracts. That is the big penalty here. There is a lot at stake.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789332">In the budget bill, after the company's lobbying, the Liberals snuck in something called a deferred prosecution agreement. In this bazillion-page document that had everything under the sun, the Liberals snuck in a major change to our laws. A deferred prosecution agreement, simply put, would allow SNC-Lavalin, if it went this route, to not have to go to jail or be convicted. It could just pay a fine, and then the company would also be eligible to bid on federal contracts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789333">This is all happening behind closed doors. It gets snuck into an omnibus budget bill, and the bill passes. However, we have something called the Public Prosecution Service, which is at arm's length, and it is the Public Prosecution Service that makes the call on whether or not this deferred prosecution agreement is used. The public prosecutor said that no, the service was not doing this and the case was going to trial.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789334">Then the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> held firm on that decision and said it was going to trial. Then, according to the Clerk of the Privy Council in testimony last week, after the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s story on this issue has changed a million times, he essentially said that they went to the former attorney general and laid out the economic implications of what would happen if this went to trial and there was a conviction. This happened after she had made her decision to proceed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789335">What we are talking about here is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office and the supposedly non-partisan head of the public service standing accused of being involved in obstruction of justice at the highest levels. That is why the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> needs to testify in front of Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5789337"> First of all, keep in mind the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> stood her ground after all of this and then what happened?

This is not just an Aga Khan island slap-on-the-wrist situation. There could potentially be serious criminality involved in this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789338">Second, what message does this send? It sends a message to everybody in this country that there are two sets of rules, that there are two different justice systems in this country, in Canada, one for people who can afford millions of dollars for lobbyists and can apply pressure based on ridings in Montreal, and one for racialized communities, women, who do not have that opportunity. We can sit here and talk about all sorts of ways to deal with that issue, but that is the reality. There are many people in Canada who do not get this opportunity and that is a huge problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789339">The third thing is that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, “Mr. Feminist”, acts like he is such a feminist and stands up for women. The Clerk of the Privy Council, at the justice committee last week, basically said the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> experienced things differently when he was trying to explain whether this was “inappropriate pressure” that could be criminal. Where did we hear that before? The Prime Minister had a groping allegation and he used those exact same words: She experienced it “differently”. This is not he said, she said. As Maclean's magazine said, “It’s a ‘he, he, he-said'.” He is a fake feminist.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789340">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is somebody who wraps feminism around him like a warm, fuzzy cloak to get votes and then when the rubber hits the road, when lobbyists come upon him, it is “she experienced it differently” and “she should have done something else”. That is garbage. That is disgusting. He needs to be held accountable for that in front of the justice committee. One does not get to stand up and claim to be a feminist and then do that to a woman. That just cannot be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789341">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has also kept her silent. He has kept her muzzled and on a leash while he goes out and spins this story. That is disgusting. That is wrong. He needs to be held to account for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789342">Finally, as a Calgary MP, deferred prosecution agreements are not supposed to consider economic arguments, yet the Clerk of the Privy Council said in the justice committee that he told the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> about the economic argument and that a lot of jobs were at stake. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789343">Maybe the company should not have bribed Libyan officials to begin with. Maybe it should not have bribed people for contracts. Maybe there should be a cost for doing that. Where is the economic considerations for all of the punitive policies the government has put against Albertan energy companies? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789344">Constituents in my riding are looking at this and asking why Montreal gets deferred prosecution agreements. As we found out today, the government is considering changing the rules, so even if the company is convicted, it can still bid on federal contracts. Why are those jobs better than jobs in my riding? The role of a prime minister is to unite our country. All jobs are important. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> should stand for justice. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789345">This is disgusting. This is what every single one of us in this place should be standing up against, regardless of political stripe. Every person sitting on the Liberal backbench is not here just for themselves. They are here to stand up for justice and for their community. Their role is to hold the government to account, even if that government is of the same partisan stripe as they are. This is where the rubber hits the road. This is where we stand for what is right or we stand for nothing at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789346">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was wrong. He should stand in front of the justice committee and answer for the fact that he has put words in a strong woman's mouth, that he said that one set of jobs is better than another set of jobs, that he stands accused of obstruction of justice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789347">Everybody in this country, regardless of how we vote, stands for one thing and that is the independence of our judiciary, the fact that our country can stand tall and proud and say we do not do business the same way that other countries do. That starts today with the leader of our country. He needs to be in front of this committee and he needs to be held to account. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789348">Every person who votes against the motion will be giving him a shield for this type of abrogation of democracy. Every person who votes against the motion should be held to account by the people in their communities who do not want to be divided on this type of garbage, and this is the stuff that can divide our country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789349">When, at the highest level of government, the leader of our country, a fake feminist, stands up for jobs with a company that is accused of bribing Libyans, we have to get our act together and it starts with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>

Black Canadians have overcome significant challenges. Some were brought to Canada as slaves prior to the abolition of slavery in Canada, in 1793. Some then came to Canada, escaping slavery through the Underground Railroad. Many have come more recently as immigrants, such as those who came to work in the steel plants in my home community of Whitney Pier, Cape Breton.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789411">In the face of bigotry and discrimination, they have and continue to overcome. Together we must continue to fight racism. While much work has been done, there is more work to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789412">As we honour the contributions of black Canadians, I would like to recognize the contribution of one in particular. Bruce Kyereh-Addo was a Conservative activist who campaigned for important causes in every part of the country. He worked as a staffer in Ottawa and in three provincial capitals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789413">Bruce died tragically and unexpectedly this past December at the age of 33. He was well known and much loved by our Conservative family from coast to coast.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5789651">The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, which oversees the $368-billion CPP fund, was set up by an act of Parliament in 1997 and is mandated to invest in the best interests of CPP contributors and beneficiaries by maximizing returns without undue risk of loss. It is important to note that my bill would not change this mandate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789652">Despite its adherence to a policy on responsible investing, the CPPIB has billions of dollars in direct private investments in the oil and gas sector and was recently found to have increased holdings in two private U.S. companies that run American prisons. The CPPIB has also been found to have significant holdings in various arms manufacturing industries and has previously invested in companies implicated in human rights abuses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789653">The Canada pension plan is an important part of our country's retirement system, but Canadians expect its investments are carried out with certain principles in mind.

              <ParaText id="5789671">I will move specifically to a couple of quotes, because I think they are really important in terms of the context of what has been taking place over the last few weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789672"> I would ultimately argue that what we have before us is in fact an opposition that has become united. It is not the first time that the NDP and the Conservatives have decided to join forces to see what they can do. This is not necessarily about a policy issue per se, but rather about pointing fingers and character assassination, particularly focusing attention on the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. This is something we have witnessed on a number of occasions when the NDP and the Conservative Party have come together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789673">We treat all issues with the utmost importance, and I am hoping that I will be able to provide a little clarity on this. What we see on the other side is that any issue becomes a major issue, especially if members opposite can smear the government to attempt to make it look bad and take attention away from what the government is actually doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789674">If we were to take a look at what the government is doing and accomplishing, we would find that no matter what the region of the country, there is a sense of hope, a sense that there is a stronger, more willing national government that is making a difference with respect to increasing the strength of our economy and better serving Canada's middle class, those aspiring to be a part of it and those who are working hard in our communities. I take a great sense of pride in what we have been able to accomplish.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789675">Over the last while, we have not heard opposition members talking about policy issues related to Canada's economy or its social programming. This is because we are doing a fairly decent job and are having a very real impact on the lives of Canadians in every region of our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789676">Let us move to the motion that has been brought forward today by the Conservative Party. Once again, I would suggest that Conservatives want, as much as possible, to make personal attacks against personalities within the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789677">The Conservatives say that we do not have a responsibility to communicate with ministers, and in this particular case with the Attorney General. I take exception to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789678">I have listened to the debate on this issue for a number of days. I have heard many questions and answers. I am very much concerned. Obviously, there is a bit of a different standard coming from the Conservative Party. In fairness to the New Democrats, they have never been in government, so we are not able to pass judgment over what they would have been doing in government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789679">However, I can tell members that considerable lobbying took place when Stephen Harper was the Prime Minister. There is no way that Conservative members can convince me that the Prime Minister's Office at the time did not have discussions and meetings with numerous cabinet ministers. I would suggest that we all have a responsibility to communicate what we believe are important issues to our constituents, and indeed to all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789680">That is one thing that I think we are missing out on. An interesting question was asked today by the Bloc, which expressed concerns with respect to the employees of SNC. We have not heard that argument. In fact, to a certain degree, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214564" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation>, who sits in the front benches of the NDP Party, in essence said on the issue of SNC employees, “Who Cares?” To him, if SNC goes broke and no longer exists, others will pick up the slack for it. That is the type of mentality that at least some members within the New Democratic Party have on this very important issue.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="20">(1520)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5789681">There is a broader issue at hand here. Yes, there are things that occurred with SNC, and we as a government are very much concerned about the corruption allegations that have taken place in Libya. We understand and believe that there needs to be a sense of accountability. However, we also need to be aware of the 9,000-plus people who are employed by them here in Canada. There is a worldwide recognition for the company which has 40,000-plus jobs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789682">This is not something new. One would think, if one listened to the unholy alliance between the NDP and the Conservatives, that it is only the Liberals who are being lobbied by SNC. That is not true. Both the Conservative leader himself and the New Democratic leader, Jagmeet Singh, have had representations made by and been lobbied by SNC. Many members of the opposition benches have met and been lobbied by SNC equally, as have government or Liberal members of the caucus. That is nothing new. We are lobbied all the time. That is why we have independent mechanisms put in place to ensure there is a sense of transparency and accountability when it comes to lobbying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789683">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has done absolutely nothing wrong. I do not care how many times the Conservatives tell the members of the media and their constituents something different and try to spread what I believe is misinformation. Just because the opposition members, the unholy alliance between the NDP and the Conservatives, have said that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has done something wrong does not mean that it is true. That is what I believe is the case here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789684">That brings me to a couple of quotes. Unlike the opposition members, we recognize the value of our standing committees and the fine work they do, as well as the Ethics Commissioner and his independence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789685">The other day Mr. Wernick appeared before the standing committee and made a presentation. Before I comment on that, allow me to share this with those Canadians who might be participating and following this debate in any way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789686"> Mr. Wernick was a top civil servant working under Stephen Harper. I believe he possibly worked at the Department of Indian Affairs as a deputy minister. I do not know all of the details. What I do know is that he is an incredible, well-recognized, apolitical, independent civil servant who has been working at the high end, not only under this government but also under the Conservative government. It is really important for us to recognize that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789687">When Mr. Wernick came to committee, this is what he said specifically about the allegations we are hearing from the Conservatives and the NDP unholy alliance. He stated, “It is my conclusion and my assertion, based on all the information I have, that there was no inappropriate pressure on the Minister of Justice in this matter.” This is not someone who is partisan saying this, but Canada's top civil servant, someone who has made incredible contributions over different administrations to ensuring that we have the world-class civil service we have today. He stated, “based on all the information I have, that there was no inappropriate pressure on the Minister of Justice in this matter.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789688">I thought that another interesting quote from the same committee meeting was when Mr. Wernick said it was “entirely her call to make”, referring to the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former Minister of Justice</Affiliation>. She was the decider. I believe the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has been consistent with respect to that from day one.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="25">(1525)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5789689">From day one, I believe that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has been very transparent and accountable on this issue. The Conservatives and the NDP, in an unholy alliance, believe that they can score some political points based on an article that appeared in The Globe and Mail. That article was referenced at the committee. They continue to push.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789690">What is interesting is that the NDP, on the one hand, said that they believe that the Ethics Commissioner should be involved. They were the ones who encouraged the Ethics Commissioner to be involved, yet if we listen to what they are saying today, they say that the Ethics Commissioner is not going to be able to do the job. Now they say that they want more to be done. They want a public inquiry on the issue. Where was that confidence when they initially said that we should have the Ethics Commissioner engaged?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789691"> The Conservatives and the NDP are talking about standing committees. I can tell colleagues that as a government, this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in particular has made a solemn commitment to our standing committees. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789692">I was there when the Conservatives and Stephen Harper took ownership of all the standing committees. I was at PROC when the parliamentary secretary would be there dictating what would take place that day at committee. I was there when Stephen Harper would not allow any amendments, outside of government amendments, to pass. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789693">We have seen a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who has marginalized the role of parliamentary secretaries on standing committees. We have seen a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who has committed additional funds to our standing committees. We have seen a Prime Minister and a Liberal caucus, on all those points, support independent standing committees. When I say that, I am referring to opposition amendments that have passed. Many opposition members have had the opportunity to pass amendments at standing committees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789694">If we contrast Stephen Harper with our current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, they are like night and day in terms of transparency and accountability when it comes to Canada's standing committees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789695">Now we have a standing committee that is actually looking into this issue. The former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> is going to be appearing. I could be wrong, but my understanding is that it was one of the Liberal members who put in the formal request for the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> to come before the committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789696">At the end of the day, the Conservatives and the New Democrats are coming together to say how badly we need to make the standing committees more independent, when the record of the Conservative Party was abysmal at best. We finally have a government that is committed to openness, transparency and accountability at our standing committees and inside this chamber.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789697">The opposition believes that the standing committee is still not enough, even though, in many ways, such as financially and in terms of independence, we have supported it. It is where our chief civil servant was able to give a presentation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789698">When I listened to question period today and the interpretations of what took place at the standing committee, they were cherry-picking. I cannot blame them for cherry-picking, I guess, because I too am cherry-picking. I am cherry-picking what I believe Mr. Wernick made very clear to every committee member. Every member of this House is aware of exactly what it is Mr. Wernick indicated.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5789699">As I said earlier, Mr. Wernick said that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> told the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> that the decision to intervene in the case was hers alone, and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> indicated that it was entirely her call to make, that she was the decider.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5789701"> Since I have had the opportunity, as others have had the opportunity, to formulate opinions on the matter at hand, I feel very confident that there was not any inappropriate pressure. Hearing it from the top civil servant means a great deal to me. It reassures me. I hope it reassures Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789702">It will not stop the opposition. I was in opposition for over 20 years. I can appreciate the potential of a good story. If a good story is there, and members think they have something to push to the <I>n</I>th degree, they should go nuts. However, maybe they should provide a little more than what they have actually provided to date.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789703">Let us look at the questions the opposition members have been asking day in and day out. They are not providing anything new to the story, from what I can see, that ultimately justifies the type of discussions we are having here today. I do not say that lightly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789704">When I go back home every weekend, I like to get a sense of what is important to the constituents I represent.

He is trying to make it look as if SNC-Lavalin is meeting and conspiring with the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789710">Members of cabinet, members of the Liberal caucus and members on this side did, in fact, meet with SNC-Lavalin, but so did the <Affiliation DbId="232946" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>. So did the Leader of the New Democratic Party and so did many others on the opposition benches. What disappoints me is that the opposition members do not seem to care about some of the potential victims, the thousands of employees who are working for SNC-Lavalin.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5789712">Mr. Speaker, it is hard to address all the factual inaccuracies in the member's prolonged statement. He talked about the alliance between the opposition parties. We are just trying to get at the truth, which is the job we have been sent here to do on behalf of our constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789713">I will remind the member, because he was elected in 2010, that there was an unholy alliance of the Liberals and the NDP with the separatists to try to depose a duly elected Canadian government. The office of the director of public prosecutions was made independent in 2006 by Stephen Harper. He created a lobbying commissioner and an Ethics Commissioner. The reason we know that so many things have been going wrong is because of all the things done on ethics and accountability by the previous Conservative government. I never heard the member thank Stephen Harper for doing all those things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789714">On September 4, the director of public prosecutions made a decision to deny SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution agreement.

What we know so far is that at every single step, the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> denied the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s pressure. She said repeatedly to the Prime Minister's Office and to the Prime Minister directly and to the Clerk of the Privy Council that this company would not enjoy a DPA. I will mention, as a member of the Standing Committee on Finance, that the DPA was attached at the back end of an omnibus federal budget bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789715">How many times did the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> have to say no to the pressure she felt in having to provide the company with a special deal, with a special agreement, so it could get off the hook?

A Conservative member tried to say that SNC-Lavalin jobs are not all that important or are more important to this government than jobs in Calgary. I have news for the Conservatives. It does not matter where the jobs are, this government does care about jobs. We also want to ensure that there is a high level of accountability for corporations that behave inappropriately.

When the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took office, SNC-Lavalin began an aggressive lobbying campaign to implement measures to lessen the impact of its past actions. This lobbying campaign included numerous meetings with both political and bureaucratic staff at the highest levels.

Its Liberal insider executives led a campaign of illegal donations to the Liberals, ranging over $100,000. </ParaText>

It is not then just slammed into another ministry because the government is so fraught with panic and the curtains are burning and they cannot deal with the mess that they have created.

              <ParaText id="5789776">Mr. Speaker, I am rising today to discuss an extremely important issue about the independence of our judicial system, about whether or not we have one system of justice for the people and another for the powerful, about whether or not we have in this country a new golden rule where those with the gold make the rules. To ascertain whether we have devolved to that level, we need answers to serious questions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789777">Let me begin by laying out the timeline of events that led us to this debate today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789778">On September 4, 2018, SNC-Lavalin learned that the director of public prosecutions would not offer that company a so-called deferred prosecution agreement to avoid trial and prosecution for allegations of over $100 million of bribery and fraud. At that moment, the decision was made. Almost two weeks later, on September 17, 2018, the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> was called to a meeting with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Clerk of the Privy Council. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789779">At that meeting, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Clerk of the Privy Council indicated their desire that such an agreement be offered to the company, in other words, that there be a deal allowing SNC-Lavalin to avoid trial and prosecution for these alleged crimes. On that day, the clerk and the Prime Minister learned that the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> had decided not to offer such a deal to that company. The course of justice was set in place and that is important because subsection 139(2) of the Criminal Code makes it a criminal act to obstruct or defeat the course of justice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789780">We have significant evidence that members of the government attempted to do just that. For one, after the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> learned that his <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> would not offer such a deal and with full knowledge that the director of public prosecutions was not willing to offer such a deal either, he sent the Clerk of Privy Council, the Prime Minister's deputy minister, the most senior member of Canada's public service, to call the former attorney general and express his desire to see such an agreement occur. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789781">Then on December 5, the most senior staffer in the government reached out over a time period at a bar in downtown Ottawa in direct discussions with the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> and indicated his desire for there to be a deal. Gerald Butts is not just any political staffer. According to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, he and his words are the Prime Minister's own words. The Prime Minister told the entire Liberal caucus that anything that comes from Gerald Butts comes from him. In other words, the former attorney general would have known, sitting in that bar at a famous Ottawa hotel, that whatever Gerald Butts said, the Prime Minister was saying. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789782">Of course, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is called “prime” for a reason. He is the top minister. He chooses the entire cabinet. In other words, the reporting relationship is from the Attorney General up to the Prime Minister. In other words, when he repeatedly, in person, through his top public servant and later his top political staffer, indicates his will on a matter, then, by definition, the person receiving that information is under pressure to do it.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5789783">That term “pressure” is very clear, because the Attorney General is to operate as the top Canadian law officer for the Crown. While she or he is allowed to consult with members of cabinet, those members are not allowed to impose pressure under doctrines of law that are established over many decades and have been inculcated into jurisprudence. I speak of course of the Shawcross doctrine. Simply put, any Attorney General that is pressured into an action on a judicial matter, particularly a prosecution, will have experienced inappropriate interference by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789784">If a boss says to an employee he wants something done and the employee says no, and then the boss sends his top assistant and the employee says no again, and then he sends his top official and the employee says no a third time, and a month later he punts the employee from his job, would that employee really believe he has not experienced any pressure? Just think about it. The boss says an employee's job depends on doing this but there is no pressure and that the employee can make up his own mind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789785">The Clerk of the Privy Council had some interesting language about the term “pressure” when he testified. He admitted that the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> “felt pressure”. Those were his words. She felt "pressure to get it right”. Those were also his words. What did “get it right” mean? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789786">According to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, in a meeting with the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> in September, and according to a phone call from the Clerk of the Privy Council not long after, and according to Gerald Butts on December 5, getting it right meant signing a deal. In other words, she was pressured to sign a deal. That pressure had the effect of attempting to defeat, pervert or obstruct the course of justice that had already been established on September 4, when the top prosecutor refused a deal, and September 17, when the former attorney general confirmed to the Prime Minister that she was not going to provide a deal either.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789787">Here we are. Subsection 139(2) of the Criminal Code is very clear that it is an offence to alter the course of justice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789788">We have significant evidence that the Prime Minister's Office under his personal direction attempted to do just that. If not, then the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> would have no compunction whatsoever about personally appearing under oath before the justice committee. When he was the leader of the third party in opposition, he specifically called on then prime minister Stephen Harper to testify under oath in another matter. The principle that prime ministers can never be asked to testify was apparently not known to the present Prime Minister, at least until now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789789">If the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has nothing to hide, then he will come forward and answer questions under oath so that everyday Canadians can find out precisely what went on here and so that we can restore a sense of confidence that everyone follows the same rules. No matter how rich one is, no matter how much money or how many lobbyists one can summon for political assistance, no one is above the law.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5789795">Mr. Speaker, first, I would point out that the legislation the government drafted in the budget, ironically, to amend the Criminal Code, created 715.3 of that code, which allows for deferred prosecution agreements, specifically excludes economic factors from the consideration of prosecutors in offering those deals to a criminally accused corporation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789796">The Liberals claim they were trying to protect jobs, but the bill that they introduced and passed, prevents them from using deferred prosecution agreements for that purpose. Therefore, we know they could not have been doing this to protect jobs. Their own legislation makes that impossible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789797">We further know that the government is currently reviewing the policy banning companies with criminal convictions from bidding on federal contracts. In other words, the government is of the view that it could allow SNC-Lavalin. after a possible conviction. to continue to bid on those contracts, without interfering in the prosecution at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789798"> All of these factors demonstrate that the Liberals interference in this case had nothing to do with jobs and had everything to do with protecting the alleged criminals at SNC-Lavalin.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5789799">Mr. Speaker, this may in fact be a point of order. With an apology to my friend, this could also be translated into a question, I suppose.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789800">However, recently a letter was made public by the member for <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">Vancouver Granville</Affiliation>, the former attorney general, to the justice committee. The reason I rise on a point of order is that I think it is highly pertinent to the issues we have been discussing here, particularly around the issue of solicitor-client privilege.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789801"> Much of what has been said by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> earlier today, both here and in public, and by the Clerk of the Privy Council, has inferred that somehow solicitor-client privilege may not apply with regard to the former attorney general's testimony at committee, which of course is something we are all eager to hear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789802">Let me just read a small section. This is the point of order that I wish to raise to clarify what has been misrepresented by particularly government members. I know my keen friend from the Liberal ranks will want to hear what his former attorney general says. She says:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5789805">This is germane to the debate and it is central to the Liberals' argument today that the former attorney general is able to speak freely, that she is no longer bound by solicitor-client privilege. We have a letter from her and she is referencing her counsel, former Supreme Court Justice Cromwell. This is clearly relevant to the debate today and clearly pertinent to the Liberals' central argument that there is nothing preventing the former attorney general from testifying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789806"> It seems to me that in her own words and in correspondence we now have from her, this is something the Liberals should stop saying.

As we have seen over the last few days, it has become quite partisan, to the point of creating what has been called an unholy alliance between the Conservatives and the NDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789813">I know a lot of the NDP members from Montreal are out pulling votes. I gladly provided them with a map of Outremont for their benefit. The joke is on them because they do not do door-to-door all that much. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789814">In any event, I will get on with the core of my speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789815"> I would like to address the House on a very important aspect of this debate, one our government takes very seriously, which is our integrity regime that governs how we do business with suppliers. Let me be clear about where our government stands on this issue. Simply put, unethical business practices should have no place in the Government of Canada's business at all. We do not, and will not, stand for it. Canadians should not, and will not, stand for it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789816">The fact is that corporate wrongdoing imposes significant, economic and social costs that can weaken competition and threaten the integrity of our markets. It can also place barriers on our economic growth and significantly increase the cost and risk of doing business. Additionally, it undermines public and investor confidence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789817">I want to assure Canadians that protecting the integrity of our public programs and services is one of our highest priorities. How we do business with suppliers is by no means an exception. The fact is that the Government of Canada spends approximately $20 billion per year on procurement contracts, real property agreements, the management of Crown-owned properties and rental payments on over 1,690 lease contracts across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789818">These are significant dealings that call for a robust and effective integrity regime, which is precisely what we have. It helps foster ethical business practices, ensures due process for suppliers and upholds the public trust in those dealings. As the government's central purchasing agent and real property manager, Public Services and Procurement Canada is deeply committed to ensuring the highest ethical standards in everything it does. Fraud, collusion and corruption have absolutely no place in our dealings. That is precisely why PSPC has a rigorous framework around prevention, detection and enforcement. The framework is firmly based on the values of fairness, transparency and accountability, and it is focused on delivering real results for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789819">In 2015, Public Services and Procurement Canada put in place a government-wide integrity regime aimed squarely at ensuring the government did business with ethical suppliers in Canada and abroad. As part of this work, PSPC conducts more than 20,000 integrity verifications annually on contracts and real property transactions. The names of ineligible and suspended suppliers are posted on the department's website.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789820">While our integrity regime is strong, our government is committed to making it even more effective in the fight against corporate wrongdoing. In fact, since taking office, this government has taken significant steps forward to do just that. Our commitment to Canadians has always been to ensure our approach remains transparent, rigorous and consistent with best practices in Canada and abroad. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789821">In everything we do, we believe consultations are an important step in ensuring clear and transparent laws and policies fair to all. Our approach to improving and modernizing how we deal with corporate misconduct is no different. In 2017, we conducted a public consultation to seek input on expanding Canada's tool kit to address corporate wrongdoing. Government officials consulted over 370 participants and received 75 written submissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789822">In keeping with our commitment to transparency, we released a report that summarized the views of those who participated in this consultation process. The report is available to all Canadians online, and I encourage all members to read it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5789823">Based on what we have heard, last year we began the work to update and enhance our approach. Those actions included a number of provisions that we are discussing today for remediation agreements, equivalent to the Canadian deferred prosecution agreements, which are essentially an additional tool to hold corporations to account. Let me underscore the words “deferred prosecution agreement”. It is not something that was conjured up yesterday. I would point the House to a number of provisions in the Criminal Code of Canada that date back to early 2000 that deal with how we treat corporations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789824">Dealing with corporations that have committed serious offences is important for the integrity of our markets, the integrity of Canadians, but sentencing has to deal with justice, fairness and proportionality. I know the Conservatives have criticized us for suggesting that we need to protect jobs in this country, but the provisions that allow us to do that, or that allow prosecutors to do that for that matter, are in black and white in the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789825">Let me read for the House, section 718.21 of the Criminal Code, which tells about which factors the court considers when imposing a sentence.

              <ParaText id="5789847">There has been a lot of discussion about how this has been taken in Quebec, the reaction in Quebec and the alleged willingness of Quebeckers to glance over this. I mentioned in a prior speech that the rule of law is as equally important in Quebec as it is in any other province. However, we hear this narrative coming back into the Conservative discourse particularly. They are thinking that Quebec will somehow let these issues off the hook faster than they would in other provinces. I find it disgusting. We have told them to say it in French and they do not. If one aspires to lead this country, one needs to hold a discourse that has the same narrative across this country, in both official languages. I am not hearing that from members of the opposition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789848">I also heard a member of the opposition suggest that a member of Parliament, conveniently from Montreal, was appointed to be <Affiliation DbId="245290" Type="96">Minister of Justice and Attorney General</Affiliation>, which somehow insinuates that he would be more lenient on a company that has its headquarters in my riding. Before I get into the substance of it, let me remind this House of the merits of the current Attorney General. He has a Ph.D. from Yale. He served as a professor at McGill University for many years and has given impeccable legal advice throughout a distinguished career. To have a member of Parliament stand up and question his integrity is a disgrace. We can talk about bashing Montreal MPs. I am one. The member can bash me, that is okay, but I do not stand it for any of my colleagues. Regarding the allegation that he made against the current <Affiliation DbId="245292" Type="21">Attorney General</Affiliation>, I would invite him to say it outside of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789849">What we have talked about today, and what we will continue to talk about presumably over the next few days, is a regime that is intended to put a company that has admitted its crime, paid its dues and taken steps to ensure the measures it is accused of cannot and will not happen again is given a deferred prosecution agreement. That means that if it violates that agreement, it can be prosecuted. It does not mean it is off the hook. However, it does allow it, for example, to compete internationally against similarly situated companies that may or may not have benefited, and more often than not may have benefited, from similar regimes in projects that require that type of regulatory framework. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789850">As I mentioned before, SNC-Lavalin can defend itself. It has capable lawyers. However, let no one in this House suggest that the deferred prosecution regime was intended for any particular company. It is a regime that balances three things, proportionality, justice and fairness, to allow companies not to have terminate innocent employees, for example, among other things. Any member of Parliament who is suggesting that this is a Quebec thing not only does not understand Quebec but also does not understand the company they are levelling accusations against. It has most of its employment outside Canada, and most of its Canadian employment outside of Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789851">The enhanced policies that I have set forth expand on policies that are already in existence but that we have sought to make better. In certain circumstances, companies can be declared ineligible or suspended from doing business with the government. These policies also provide flexibility in determining periods of ineligibility to ensure that they are proportional, and based on the nature and the context of the offence and the steps taken by the suppliers to address misconduct. I would also note that under our current policy, a supplier found guilty of committing an offence may be declared ineligible for a period of up to 10 years.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5789852"> The ineligibility and suspension policy is an important component of the integrity regime. It sets out when and how a supplier may be declared ineligible or suspended from doing business with the government for a period of up to 10 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789853"> Allow me to inform this House about some of the things we learned and how we have taken action to address feedback gathered during those consultations, specifically as it pertains to our integrity regime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789854"> First and foremost, it was encouraging to see that participants were fully supportive of fair, proportional and transparent measures that enable the government to take action against corporate wrongdoing. They also supported measures that ultimately hold companies accountable for misconduct.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789855"> Among the majority of stakeholders, there was a call for additional discretion and flexibility within the integrity regime, specifically into the provisions of the ineligibility and suspension policy. As we look to strengthening the regime, we know that we must strike a balance by considering more flexibility in the policy that directs it and expanding the list of circumstances that could result in ineligibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789856">Let me come back to the matter currently under debate. I am a bit perplexed at the request to have the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> appear before the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. Over the past two weeks, I have seen the Prime Minister answer 40 questions on the matter for a total of 45 minutes and that does not include the questions that we all heard today. We have had questions from six MPs and two party leaders—the leader of the Conservative Party and the leader of his own party, the name of which escapes me, the hon. member seated at the back near the leader of the Green Party. Obviously the NDP House leader also asked questions of us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789857">I analyzed the questions, and I do not want to repeat all of them, but obviously the Conservatives' questions were disrespectful and implicated the Prime Minister's principal secretary, Gerald Butts, an individual who served our country with honour and integrity. I want to emphasize that. Canadians are indebted to him. The Conservatives wanted to call into question that individual's dignity and the way he served our country, no matter what the cost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789858">I know there is one member of the NDP who will laugh at this, but I wanted to compliment the parliamentary leader, who called for the waiving of solicitor-client privilege. The Prime Minister answered that question very respectfully. I will tell him because he is not in the House. I do not want to point out someone's absence from the House. The NDP's questions were more respectful than those of the Conservatives, with few exceptions. There was one question about lifting the confidentiality regime. Obviously, we would need to debate that to determine why confidentiality should be waived. There are cases before the courts. We have to look at striking a balance, achieving a proportionality, before confidentiality can be waived, whether we are talking about cabinet confidences or solicitor-client privilege.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789859">In my private practice, I was subject to solicitor-client privilege. Any time we wanted to waive that privilege, all of the potential impacts had to be examined.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789860">There are two cases before the courts. There is talk of an investigation by the Ethics Commissioner. Obviously, these considerations could harm the interests of Canadians and third parties. This is something that must be figured out between the former attorney general and cabinet as such.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789861">I am sure—and this will make the debate less partisan—that this will be settled among lawyers in a sober and deliberate way, and that the former minister of justice and attorney general will have the chance to speak candidly.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5789862">Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his speech. I do not have any questions for him, but I do have a comment. I have been listening to this debate all day, and I have not heard a single opposition member say that this company should receive special treatment because it is based in Quebec. I have not heard a single member of the House mention that this company is based in Quebec, that it has employees all over the world or that it could be considered a flagship of Quebec industry. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789863">I did, however, hear members talk about the interference by the Prime Minister's Office in a criminal matter and about the fact that the former attorney general of Canada was put under so much pressure that she is now an ordinary member of Parliament and not a member of cabinet. She resigned after the Prime Minister said that her presence in cabinet was proof that there was no interference. This is what we are debating today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789864">On September 4, the director of the Public Prosecution Service of Canada decided there would be no special agreement for the company, and she confirmed that decision on October 9. Over the following three months, the Prime Minister's Office and his staff put sustained pressure on the attorney general, who resigned and is no longer in cabinet. An hour ago, she sent a letter to the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights saying that she cannot appear as a witness until solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence are waived. She will therefore not talk to the committee about the pressure she was subjected to and the information she has. That is the matter we are discussing today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789865"> With this motion, we are asking the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to do what he does every Wednesday in the House. We are asking him to take an hour or two of his time to appear before the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights to testify and tell the truth and nothing but the truth about this specific case.</ParaText>

That is an obvious case of Quebec-bashing. I would encourage him to speak to his colleague and ask him to apologize because that is unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789867"> With respect to what he said next, waiving confidentiality involves some very complex considerations. If he wants to ask the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> questions, he can do so in the House. If he is not happy with the questions his leader asks, he himself can ask the Prime Minister. There is ample opportunity to do so every Wednesday. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5789874">Canadians expect there to be robust discussions between the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada and the Prime Minister's Office in a G7 country, a pluralistic democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789875">Canadians expect there to be extensive, even difficult, discussions on certain issues, especially issues that could hurt our country, whether we are talking about jobs or any other issue. Otherwise, we would be living in a democracy that does not reflect who we are. Obviously, in this particular case, the final decision was for the former attorney general to make.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789876">The nature of those discussions is quite unique. They are subject to cabinet confidentiality, in other words, cabinet confidence, within a solicitor-client relationship. There are two kinds of confidentiality, perhaps even three or four. The confidentiality we are talking about refers to the legal privilege that exists between solicitors and their clients. There is also a general confidentiality regime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789877">People are confused, and they have every reason to be. However, the regime must have a partial exception for matters in which the clients, who in this case are cabinet and the Prime Minister, speak about matters that could be secret and could have unintended consequences for third parties. We do not want information to get out that could undermine an ongoing court case, for example, or, and I am obviously speculating here, that would have a negative impact on a third party or inadvertently reveal secrets. As a citizen, I think that secrets should stay within cabinet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789878">I am a member of the caucus, and I expect my cabinet to keep secrets. I expect some matters not to be known in the public sphere. This is absolutely reasonable to me. Lawyers obviously need to have a non-partisan discussion to understand the scope of what the witness would testify to. I support these kinds of discussions, in order to give Canadians the truth they are looking for. </ParaText>

Actually, deferred prosecution agreements are a way of fighting white-collar crime, because they, and I am quoting Lawrence Ritchie, from Osler, “encourage the voluntary disclosure of misconduct by corporations for criminal activities that may otherwise have remained unknown to regulators”.</ParaText>

It is not a provision that is intended to exclude every single large company in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789887"> I would note, in the case of the company everyone is speculating about, that it is a company that has jobs outside Canada. Therefore, we could perhaps make an argument that these sorts of considerations would not apply to it. However, these are important things, because we do not want to encourage bad behaviour and protectionist behaviour. That is why these provisions were put in place.

              <ParaText id="5789894"> This has been going on for just over two weeks, and in the past few days, it has become clear that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is a key player in this matter. We are talking about the Prime Minister of Canada. He is surrounded by important people who advise him and do his work on the ground behind the scenes, in an attempt to protect him. These people play a key role in the scandal that broke just over two weeks ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789895">If the members of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights do not have an opportunity to question the Prime Minister directly, we will never know the full truth. He is hiding to avoid giving the real version of the facts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789896">For the benefit of those watching at home, I will now give a brief overview of everything that has been said in the House of Commons or in the media over the past two weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789897">This all began with a budget implementation exercise in which the Liberal government tried to sneak through legislation to allow for remediation agreements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789898">What is a remediation agreement? It is a way to prevent a corporation from being convicted of fraud or corruption. These types of agreements are also designed to protect the jobs of the people working for the corporation, so they are not penalized for management decisions that may involve corruption in some cases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789899">Rather than following the path of transparency and including this in a justice bill, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> surreptitiously slipped it into a budget from the finance department so that no one could ask any questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789900">In doing so, no parliamentarians from any party, including senators, could ask the justice minister any questions in an effort to improve the bill, which would have been the right thing to do, to see what the Liberals' real intentions were, or where they wanted to go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789901">Time passed, and on September 4, 2018, the director of public prosecutions announced that the government could not negotiate a remediation deal with SNC-Lavalin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789902">The director of public prosecutions is neutral, and she works closely with her legal experts and advisers. Under no circumstances should any parliamentarian attempt to influence her decisions. Apparently, the Prime Minister decided that the director of public prosecutions had not made the right decision. The former attorney general, who was also the justice minister at the time, endorsed and supported that decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789903">Then, rather curiously, on September 17, 2018, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> met with the former attorney general to discuss the matter.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5789904">In the days that followed, there was a blitz of meetings with very influential people and SNC-Lavalin lobbyists. They tried to influence the former attorney general's decision in the matter. On December 5, Gerald Butts, senior adviser and friend to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, pressured the former attorney general. As I pointed out, so did the Prime Minister, on September 17.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789905">On December 19, Mr. Wernick, this government's top public servant, told the former attorney general, who should be independent and has experts to provide her with legal advice, that, in his opinion, she had not made the right decision. I said “in his opinion”, but I could say in the Prime Minister's opinion. I would like to point out that the director of public prosecutions confirmed this decision once again on October 9. The decision was confirmed on two occasions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789906">It appears that if you do not agree with the Prime Minister, you are wrong. That is when the monkey business started and pressure was brought to bear to try to change the former attorney general's mind. It was not enough to be told no. It was not enough to apply pressure. She refused to budge, and we all know where that landed her. After the holidays and before the House resumed, there was a cabinet shuffle. Suddenly, this justice minister, whom no one had complained about, lost her job just because she did not want to do the Prime Minister's bidding. She believed in her heart and soul that she had made the right decision. The Prime Minister and his advisers should never have pressured her.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789907">That is what gave rise to what is now being called the SNC-Lavalin scandal. That is what the media is calling it. It is not an SNC-Lavalin scandal, it is the Prime Minister's scandal. That is the reality. We should be focusing on that and allowing the former attorney general to speak. She is asking to speak, but just an hour ago she refused to appear before the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights because she would not have the complete freedom to give her side of the story. We will not know what happened. We will once again be left with a Prime Minister who hid the truth and was not transparent with people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789908">Then, there was a dramatic turn of events. After the Prime Minister blamed former minister Scott Brison for stepping down and said that what happened may have been his fault, and after saying that neither he nor his close collaborators ever interfered in the matter, we saw his principal adviser and close friend step down. He did not step down because he made a mistake. He said he stepped down because he did nothing wrong. That is incredible. No one here called for his resignation even though he was the Prime Minister's best friend and principal adviser. The fact is that he stepped down simply to protect the Prime Minister from the fallout of the major mistake he made in this file.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789909">The strange thing is that the Prime Minister has given several different versions of what happened. First, he said that the allegations were false. Then he blamed the former attorney general for the confusion. He is shifting the blame because he is unable to take responsibility for his own actions. He said that the Ethics Commissioner's investigation would be enough to get answers in this case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789910">I would like to remind everyone that he is the only prime minister in the history of Canada to have been found guilty by the Ethics Commissioner four times. That has done nothing to change his behaviour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789911">He reminded the House that the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights is independent and impartial, but then he refused, via the Liberal committee members, to accept the proposals that the Conservative Party made to the committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789912">What is more, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214027" Type="2">Mount Royal</Affiliation> said that it was the former attorney general's fault because she did not speak French. Those same members make a huge deal about trying to defend French. Everything that we have heard is rather unbelievable. The story has been changing every day for the past two weeks, and we still do not know the truth about this scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789913">I would like to remind members that this scandal is not about SNC-Lavalin, but about the Liberal Prime Minister. It is an obvious failure. The election is approaching. Canadians have the right to know the truth about this matter.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="55">(1655)</Timestamp>

              <ParaText id="5789916">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments made by the member opposite, but I would like to point out one thing and ask him a question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789917">First of all, this is the second time in a row that it has been said that the course of justice had already been established on September 4. The member for <Affiliation DbId="214462" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> also made that statement in his comments.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="5789918">This is effectively stating that the course of justice had been set as of September 4. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789919">Mr. Wernick was asked this very question about discussions that were appropriate, as he described them, with the <Affiliation DbId="214321" Type="4">former minister of justice</Affiliation> after September 4. He said that they were indeed lawful and appropriate in the course of having discussions between the Prime Minister's Office and in and amongst cabinet members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789920">The illogic of the position that has been outlined by two Conservative members is really quite stark. There are things that are known as attorney general directives, and those attorney general directives sometimes apply to litigation that is already in the courts. One was put out with respect to indigenous litigation and one with respect to HIV litigation. I just put that out there to outline the illogic of the position being articulated on the opposition benches.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789921">The question I have relates to where the member finished his speech with respect to the ethics investigator. We know that the ethics investigator has the power to summon witnesses and the power to require them to provide evidence under oath. The ethics investigator also has the power to require those witnesses to produce documents. For the purpose of enforcing those powers, the ethics investigator has the same power as a court of record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789922">Is it the position of the member opposite that the ethics investigator is not an independent forum that cannot find the answers that he seeks?</ParaText>

Unfortunately, he did not share statistics about the number of answers we received.

              <ParaText id="5789932">One of the reasons I do not really trust him has to do with the senior official who appeared before committee last week and said that cabinet never discussed this file. That contradicts what the <Affiliation DbId="214329" Type="4">Minister of National Revenue</Affiliation> said on the radio last week, when she told the host that she could not talk about discussions that were held within cabinet.

              <ParaText id="5789935">I held a town hall in my riding of Aurora—Oak Ridges—Richmond Hill on Sunday on taxes, tariffs and trade. We had a good discussion on taxes, tariffs and trade, but what most of my constituents wanted to know was what the SNC-Lavalin affair was, and perhaps more importantly, why it mattered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789936">It is highly complicated and confusing, with a lot of different information surrounding it. Therefore, what exactly is it and why does it matter? First and foremost, it is not about SNC-Lavalin and it is not about jobs. It is specifically about the coordinated, unsolicited and sustained pressure on the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> to politically interfere and overturn a decision by the director of public prosecutions to proceed with the prosecution of fraud and bribery charges against SNC-Lavalin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789937">That is quite complicated, but what it is more importantly about is the pattern of behaviour from the government, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, his staff, ministers and cabinet in general, undermining the democratic institutions at the very core of our rules-based order and who we are as Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789938">Let us talk about that for a bit. The executive branch, the judicial branch and the legislative branch are critically important pillars of our democracy. They are structured in such a way as to be independent and somewhat separate from each other because they act as checks and balances on each other. Within the executive branch, there is cabinet and the Prime Minister. They have specific responsibilities as well, not the least of which is to not politically interfere in the judicial system and to protect and preserve the independence of that judicial system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789939">Why is that important? It is that ultimately our democracy and rules-based order is dependent on every citizen, company and organization being equal in the eyes of the law and justice being blind to their race, ethnicity, creed, vocation, language or whatever it is. Secondly, those decisions must be made with only the law in mind, not with political interference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789940">In this case, we are looking at a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who had a pattern of inappropriate and possibly illegal behaviour. First of all, he said that the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> has the authority to make these decisions on her own because they are her decisions and hers alone. There is an issue with that. As a mother, when I tell my son I want him to do the dishes, is it his decision whether he does them or not? It is actually not really his decision because I have a certain amount of authority over my son, or I like to think I do. If my daughter, who is younger than my son, were to ask him to help her with something, it truly would be his decision.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5789941">Therefore, when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> asks the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> to do something, it absolutely is pressure, because, as we can see, she decided not to take the course of action that he was recommending. As a result, he put even more pressure on her after that decision was made, and in the end she actually was removed from her position. One has to ask if someone else was put in her place to do what she would not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789942">The other key thing here is that the Attorney General and the Minister of Justice may physically be the same individual, but they are two separate and distinct responsibilities. Cabinet, the Clerk of the Privy Council and even the PMO under our rules, regulations and laws have the ability to advise and support the Minister of Justice, but they do not have that same privilege for the Attorney General, because the Attorney General is acting as a capacity of that judicial system, which is separate. Therefore, to confuse those two positions further undermines it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789943">One has to ask what the responsibility was of the PMO, Gerald Butts and others when they were having meetings with the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> and applying pressure at the Château Laurier. One does also have to ask why the meetings were at the Château Laurier. It is not a normal operation of our business. We have offices here in the House of Commons and other government buildings around the town, so we should be having meetings there. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789944">Of course, there is the Clerk of the Privy Council who has a responsibility to advise and support the execution of the machinery of the executive branch but not to advise the Attorney General on legal matters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789945">The three important aspects of democracy are truly what is at stake in this conversation. The rule of law and our democracy are incredibly important, and that is why we are here to talk about it today. To say that this motion for getting to the truth is for partisan political points absolutely grossly misrepresents the severity of this conversation. Each and every one of us, as members of Parliament or as ministers in the executive branch, has sworn an oath to this country and to the Queen to uphold democracy. If we cannot rely on members of Parliament to be above partisan policy when the very nature of our democracy is at stake, then what is the value of being in the House? If we will not stand up to protect, preserve and defend our democracy, and in so doing ensure that individuals holding important positions in the executive branch are held accountable in accordance with our laws, then who will?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789946"> That is why this motion is so incredibly important. We must get to the truth. We must ensure that the very nature of our democracy is preserved, and we must find a way to have the courage on both sides of the House to remember that we are serving Canadians first. We get paid by Canadians, not by a political party, and we are here to deliver for Canadians not only a government agenda but also the very nature and fabric of our democracy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789947">That is what is at stake in the SNC-Lavalin case. It is not about jobs and it is not about SNC-Lavalin. It is about whether or not the individuals in this institution are upholding their responsibilities, and this motion is critically important to be able to get to that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789948">I hope that all in this House will support this motion to protect, defend and preserve our democracy. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5789956">Mr. Speaker, I am excited to answer that for the simple reason that it is a representation of the confusion around this issue.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5789959">Mr. Speaker, as I have been listening to the debate today, there has been a lot of confusion between what is appropriate and what is not, and a lot of discussion as to where the various different cards fall with respect to obligation. I would like to take my time today to talk about the Shawcross and <I>sub judice</I> principles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789960">In Canada, there is a fundamental and constitutional principle that the Attorney General should act independently of any partisan consideration when exercising his or her discretion. The Supreme Court of Canada stated that this is a fundamental principle in the 2002 case of Krieger v. Law Society of Alberta.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789961">It is important to understand what exactly the principle requires and what constitutes and does not constitute political interference with prosecutorial discretion. The Shawcross helps us to understand this concept, which is why I would like to take a few minutes to discuss it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789962">In short, the principle emphasizes the paramount importance of the independence of a prosecution while recognizing that it is entirely appropriate for the Attorney General to consult with his or her cabinet colleagues before exercising his or her powers of prosecution. The principle comes from Sir Hartley Shawcross, who in a speech to the United Kingdom Parliament in 1951 explained how the Attorney General should exercise his power to authorize criminal prosecutions, and what legitimate consultations the Attorney General could have with other members of the government in exercising this power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789963">Shawcross did not invent the principle, but his words on this subject are probably the most famous. I think it is worthwhile reading a part of his speech that is now recognized in the principle.</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789966">I would like to emphasize what I think are important elements of this speech. First, the Attorney General must consider whether the prosecution is in the public interest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789967">Second, in making the assessment, the Attorney General can consult with other members of cabinet, since they can offer insight into what might best serve the public. Sometimes consultation with cabinet colleagues will be important in order for the Attorney General to be cognizant of pan-government perspectives. These consultations can improve the quality of decision-making. Such consultations are not to be equated with interference or prosecutorial discretion. In short, the Shawcross principle does not preclude consultation and says that in some situations it is to be encouraged.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789968">Third, the responsibility for the decision of whether or not to authorize the prosecution is that of the Attorney General alone. Cabinet can in no way direct the Attorney General to make a particular decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789969">Fourth, in making the decision of whether or not to prosecute, the Attorney General may not act in a partisan way and must be guided only by the public interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789970">In 1978, the Attorney General of Canada, Ron Basford, referred to the Shawcross principle while explaining to the House of Commons his decision not to initiate a prosecution under the Official Secrets Act. He explained the constitutional and legal principles that he had to take into account as the Attorney General. I think it would be useful to quote his words on that. He said:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5789973">This is by no means the only time the principle has been adopted by the Attorney General of Canada. Provincial attorneys general have also spoken on it, such as Ontario attorneys general Roy McMurtry and Ian Scott, in 1979 and 1987 respectively. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789974">It is generally well recognized that the Shawcross principle applies to attorneys general in Canada unless a legislative limit has been placed on the ability of the attorney general to consult with respect to particular prosecutions. This is the case, for example, in Nova Scotia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789975">I want to turn now to a concrete example of how this principle was exercised in the U.K. in the Corner House Research case. The director of the Serious Fraud Office, who exercises both investigatory and prosecutorial authority, was conducting an investigation into bribery allegations in the context of military aircraft contracts between a British company and the Saudi Arabian government. The company sought to stop the investigation on the basis of its potential impact on a huge export contract and its effect on relations between the United Kingdom and the Saudi government. When the fraud office was about to examine the Swiss bank accounts, a representative of the Saudi government made a specific threat that if the investigation continued, there would be no contract and it would imperil intelligence and diplomatic ties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789976">Ministers of the U.K. government, including the prime minister, advised the attorney general and the director of the fraud office that if the investigation were not shut down, “the consequences would be grave, both for the arms trade and for the safety of British citizens and service personnel”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789977">The British ambassador to Saudi Arabia warned that “British lives on British streets were at risk”. The director of the fraud office decided, after extensive consultation, to terminate the investigation. The case was heard by the House of Lords, and it concluded that there was no clash with the rule of law. The director could legally make the decision he had to make. Even more, the House of Lords said that with all the facts the director had, any responsible decision-maker could not have done otherwise. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789978">This example shows how important it is for other ministers, and sometimes for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, to inform the Attorney General of particular elements that may affect his or her decision to prosecute. The public interest effects that may arise from a prosecution are relevant considerations in this regard and they could have an impact on the Attorney General's decision to initiate prosecution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789979">In the example of Corner House Research, the public interest considerations shared with the attorney general and the director of the anti-fraud office were that the security of British citizens was threatened and that it would have had a negative impact on diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789980">Thus, while the Attorney General can, and in fact should, consult with members of his or her cabinet, what is of paramount importance is that the responsibility for a potential decision rests with the Attorney General, who ultimately exercises that responsibility independently and is guided solely by the public interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789981">I would now like to turn to the <I>sub judice</I> convention. In our parliamentary system, we adhere to and respect well-established constitutional principles and conventions. Foremost among them is the principle of the separation of powers, which our Supreme Court has emphasized is a principle that is fundamental to the workings of Parliament and the courts. This principle requires that each branch of government recognize the role of the other branches and respect the appropriate limits of its own role. As such, by convention, members of Parliament do not comment on matters that are pending before the courts. This is known as the <I>sub judice</I> rule, <I>sub judice</I> being Latin for “under judicial consideration”. Until that judicial consideration is complete, the convention dictates that the matter not be discussed in the House of Commons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789982">The rule is described in <I>Parliamentary Rules and Forms of the House of Commons of Canada </I>, as follows: “Members are expected to refrain from discussing matters that are before the courts or tribunals which are courts of record.”</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789990">We here in this House insist on respect for parliamentary privilege. Parliamentary privilege is “one of the ways in which the fundamental constitutional separation of powers is respected.” On the other hand, we must also remember that the separation of powers requires respect for the related constitutional principle of judicial independence. As a result, we must refrain from interfering directly or indirectly in the role of the courts. That especially holds true for courts seized with criminal prosecutions and related matters. We must therefore respect the case law convention, because it contributes to the respect of the principles of the separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789991">We need to maintain a balance between the powers, roles and functions of the executive, the legislature and the judiciary. This long-standing convention is one of the important means we have to maintain that balance. The convention recognizes the courts, as opposed to the House, as the proper forum in which to decide individual cases. Furthermore, it is also important to note that the convention has been applied consistently in all matters relating to criminal cases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789992">In our parliamentary system, speaking on matters that are before the courts of justice, particularly courts seized with criminal matters and related proceedings, may risk prejudicing the outcome of a trial and may affect the protection of due process, including the presumption of innocence afforded accused persons in our society. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms constitutionally guarantees the right of persons charged with offences “to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal”. I am certain that no member in this chamber would want to undermine that fundamental constitutional right by discussing matters that are within the rightful purview and jurisdiction of the courts and that are pending before them a decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5789993">This brings us back to the reason for the rule: to protect not only the constitutional principles of judicial independence and the separation of powers but also the constitutional rights of accused persons. In a House respectful of those principles as well as constitutionalism and the rule of law, we must do all we can to avoid interference, or even the perception of interference, with due process, the broader principles of fundamental justice and the impartial role of the courts. The <I>sub judice</I> rule helps to protect judicial independence and the rule of law by avoiding the risk that judges or juries could be seen to be influenced by the debate in this place. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5790028">Madam Speaker, I want to note I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="213959" Type="2">Louis-Saint-Laurent</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790029">I am glad to have the opportunity to rise to debate this really important motion today, which is calling for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to go before the justice committee and provide some clarity as to what is actually going on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790030">What I think we need to do is to first cast back to pre-2006. There was something happening at that time that was very important. The Gomery inquiry was happening with respect to the sponsorship scandal, which was about broad corruption, illegal activities and the funnelling of precious taxpayer dollars to suit the Liberal Party's purposes. It was a really significant issue. Canadians were very concerned about what was going on and in actual fact it put the Liberals into the penalty box for the next 10 years, because Canadians saw what the Liberal government was doing with respect to its ethics and inability to protect taxpayer dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790031">Then the Conservatives took over in 2006 and recognized that there were some significant issues that needed to be addressed. We brought forward the Federal Accountability Act and also set up the office of the director of public prosecutions to try to keep that separation that was so important and to deal with some of the many flaws we had seen regarding large amounts of dollars going from taxpayers to the benefit solely of the Liberal Party of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790032">Then 2015 came along and we had a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who talked about sunny ways, about transparency and about doing things differently, and Canadians listened and gave him a majority mandate. I think what they were given was a veneer and a good talk. However, what we have found over the last three and half years is that was all it was. I have used this example before and I will use it again. If we take a health care example, what we have is a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who might have a good bedside manner but is absolutely not the person we would want performing our diagnosis, surgery or behaving in any way we would expect from our leadership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790033">We are three years in and we have broken promises. We have a deficit that the Liberals promised we would not have. They promised electoral reform, yet look at what happened with that. Then we had a series of ethical violations. There was the Aga Khan issue, where I believe the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was found guilty of four violations when he accepted a trip. Does this sound like the Liberals from 10 years prior? It sure sounds like those Liberals to me. We had the handing out by the prior fisheries minister of a lucrative surf clam contract to friends and insiders. Also, we had the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, who managed to forget the villa in France that he owned. Not many of us would forget a villa in France, but he happened to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790034">What we have seen is not only a series of broken promises but also a number of ethical violations. To me that is a huge betrayal of the trust that Canadians put in the Liberal government in 2015 when it made so many promises to be different and to be better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790035">This brings us to where we are today, which is really quite a sordid saga that we have in front of us. Many of us were surprised when the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> was unceremoniously shuffled into the veterans affairs portfolio. Certainly, anyone watching that ceremony that day could tell that she was not particularly pleased with what was happening. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790036">This is a government that had promised never to introduce omnibus budget bills. However, for my portfolio, there was an addition to reserve policy that I asked the indigenous affairs committee to look at. The Liberals refused. They voted us down, did not allow us to look at that and it was shoved into a budget bill.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5790037">There was also the deferred prosecution agreement clause, which now in retrospect is one of the first dots that we need to connect. We will have a number of dots to connect in order to provide a very clear story.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790038">We have a prosecution agreement. We know a company was working very hard to have that deferred prosecution agreement made into law. Things were going along quite well according to the plan. The plan all along was to allow the deferred prosecution agreement. The Liberals can say what they want with respect to other countries, but clearly it was put there for a purpose.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790039">Then we heard in September that the independent public prosecution office was not going to play ball with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790040"> The government talks about the importance of <I>sub judice</I>. We heard in a prior speech how critical it was to separate the judicial branch and the legislative branch. We also have an executive branch and there should be a similar separation, but the Liberals are not talking about that today. They so far have not shown they have any respect for the critical importance of the separation of the executive branch with the judicial branch.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790041">We talked about the budget bill. We had the decision by the public prosecution. Now we have what is now a well-documented outreach. This is not the Attorney General of Canada asking for advice or support; this is outreach by the most powerful in the country. Gerald Butts of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office and the Clerk of the Privy Council just happened to do outreach to the former attorney general to suggest she needed more context around her decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790042"> It is absolutely shameful that they would ever suggest that was not pressure. They were the head of the Privy Council and Mr. Butts. The Prime Minister said that when Mr. Butts spoke, it came from the Prime Minister. Do not let anyone ever say that is not pressure when they happened to be giving context, asking if she would rethink her decision when she had already made it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790043">One of the articles I read this weekend was perfect. It said “How many times does our attorney general have to say no?” The company is still lobbying and it wants a different decision. The Clerk of the Privy Council suggested that this was appropriate pressure. That is not appropriate pressure and I think no one out there believes it was appropriate pressure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790044">We need the ability not only to hear from the former attorney general, we need to hear from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, because we have potentially not only a breach of interference from the executive branch to the judicial branch. I am not sure that we do not have something criminal going on here and we need to get to the bottom of it.</ParaText>

It was studied at the justice committee on November 7. It was studied at the finance committee, at the Senate committee and that all occurred after year-long consultations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790046">Today, the member has said that we do not have any respect for the separation between the judicial and the executive branch. I find that kind of commentary quite rich coming from a member of that level of experience, given the track record of the previous government when the former prime minister, Stephen Harper, threw Beverley McLaughlin under the bus for daring to comment on the qualifications of a potential Supreme Court appointee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790047">In respect to the separation and the accountability mechanisms, there is one. It is called the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5790050">Madam Speaker, this is a serious matter. Parliament is not often presented with a motion in which the sitting Prime Minister is being called to testify under oath in front of Parliament. It did happen in a previous Parliament when Stephen Harper was here. The Liberals joined with us, I suppose in some form of alliance they were happy to participate in then, to call the then Prime Minister Stephen Harper to testify under oath at committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790051">The reason that was so serious was because the concerns and allegations under the Nigel Wright-Mike Duffy affair went right into the heart of the Prime Minister's Office. What had taken place had money exchange hands, which was rightly concerning to Canadians. My Conservative colleagues do not always want to remember those days, which is fair enough, but that was something that Canadians, including even Liberals in that case, wanted to know about what was going on in the Prime Minister's Office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790052">However, now the allegations that have been put forward into the public, on which the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is constantly shifting stories, is that within his office the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> may have received constant and unrelenting pressure to allow a plea deal to a company that had extensively lobbied the government for special treatment. That is special access. That is two sets of laws: one for specially connected people and companies, and another set for everyone else. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790053">When we are dealing with this gravity of power and the potential abuse of that power, is it not time for Canadians to hear from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5790054">Madam Speaker, it is important to point out that a Conservative scandal was a $16 orange juice and paying taxpayers' dollars back where it was felt it did not pass the smell test. I think what we are talking about is absolutely on a different scale.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790055">At the start of my comments, I spoke about the sponsorship scandal and how the Liberals had this sense of entitlement about how they could use taxpayers' dollars for their own purposes, their own gain. We are now hearing how the Liberals continue to do that. Whether it is the Aga Khan or some of the other issues where they have been found guilty of ethical violations, they continue to blur the boundaries to accomplish what they want. In this case, some of the most powerful people in this country pressured the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation>, a first nations woman, an accomplished woman. We were all proud of her when she took over that role, and she has been unceremoniously turfed because she did not do what they wanted her to do.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5790056">Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to participate in this debate, even though, as a Canadian, I would have preferred if this sad story had never happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790057">What we want to know is how much political interference, by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> or the PMO, occurred in a criminal case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790058">One of the cornerstones of our democracy is the separation between politics and justice. There has to be a wall between the two. However, unfortunately, there has obviously been political interference in a criminal case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790059">Let us review the facts. In 2015, criminal charges of corruption were brought against a large corporation in Montreal regarding its dealings in Libya. Unfortunately, this same company was found guilty of corruption less than a year ago in the case involving the McGill University Health Centre, or MUHC, in Montreal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790060">Then, on June 21, the government passed omnibus Bill <Document DbId="9727472" Type="3">C-74</Document>. At the very end of the bill, there is a measure concerning remediation agreements that has absolutely nothing to do with the budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790061">Over seven or eight pages, the government clearly defined a process to allow a company that is facing serious international prosecution, as is the case here, to sign an agreement with the government. If, by chance, this were ever to happen, the bill explains the procedure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790062">I want to remind members that subsection 715.32(3) explicitly states that “the prosecutor must not consider the national economic interest”. The prosecutor is the Government of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790063">This omnibus bill passed with clauses regarding agreements, as defined earlier, that have absolutely nothing to do with the budget. This happened on June 21. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790064">In similar cases, the director of public prosecutions could look into the matter, make a decision and inform the respondent. This is exactly what happened. On September 4, the director of public prosecutions informed the company in question that she would be moving forward and that an agreement was not possible. There we go. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790065"> Nearly three weeks ago, The Globe and Mail reported that strong pressure on the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> allegedly led her to quit her job, a very prestigious position in our parliamentary system if ever there was one. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790066">What happened?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790067">On September 17, the Prime Minister of Canada contacted the former attorney general to discuss this case. On December 5, the Prime Minister of Canada's principal secretary contacted the former attorney general to discuss this case. On December 19, Canada's top public servant, the most powerful man in the public service of Canada, the Clerk of the Privy Council, picked up the telephone and directly contacted the former attorney general. On January 14, the former attorney general was relieved of her duties by the Prime Minister. Those are the facts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790068">We now want to find out just how much undue pressure was applied to influence the former attorney general.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790069">I should mention that last week, The Globe and Mail, the newspaper that broke the story that has been tarnishing the government's image and consequently Canada's image abroad for the past three weeks, published another story claiming that the former attorney general told cabinet that she had been subjected to undue pressure.<I /></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790070">Was she subjected to undue pressure, yes or no?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790071">Last week, Canada's top public servant clearly stated three times that, yes, there had been pressure, but that it was not undue pressure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790072">Of course it was not undue pressure. It was just pressure from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, his principal secretary and Canada's top public servant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790073">One, two, three people pressured the former attorney general about a specific matter, and that was not undue pressure? Clearly, there was undue pressure on Canada's former attorney general.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5790074">Canada's highest-ranking public servant testified that, yes, there was pressure, but it was not undue pressure. With all due respect to that important figure in our political hierarchy, I have something to say to him. If the question is whether the pressure was undue, I would rather hear the person who was pressured, not the party applying the pressure, say whether it was undue or not, whether it was appropriate or not. In this particular case, the end result was the former attorney general's departure, since she was relieved of her duties. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790075">As I said, The Globe and Mail exposed the whole affair three weeks ago. What happened then? The government and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> have treated us to a comedy of errors ever since. The Prime Minister changed his story at least five times over the first few days. He contradicted himself at least five times. He started off by saying that no one could comment on the matter due to cabinet confidence. Canada's highest-ranking public servant contradicted the Prime Minister last week when he said it was never discussed in cabinet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790076"> The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> clearly stated that the continued presence of the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> in cabinet spoke for itself. Fifteen hours later, she quit cabinet for good. It does not get much clearer than that. That is what happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790077">A few days later, a teary-eyed Prime Minister apologized for not being quick enough to condemn the bad people who had attacked the former attorney general. An hour later, here in the House, she said she was eager to speak her truth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790078">I was here in my seat. The Prime Minister was 10 or 12 feet away from me. I can say one thing. If looks could kill, it would not have been pretty. He was not happy when the member said she was looking forward to sharing her version of events.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790079">From the start, we have wanted everyone to testify, from the former attorney general to the Prime Minister's chief adviser or the Prime Minister himself. Initially, when we asked for that, government members called it a witch hunt and a distraction. Eventually, they realized it was the right thing to do. The country's top civil servant and the former attorney general can testify. That is a win.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790080">We need the whole truth to come out. That is why, in this motion moved by the leader of the official opposition for the good of Canada, we are calling on the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the one who ignited this scandal, to give his side of the story.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790081">Today I heard the <Affiliation DbId="224669" Type="4">Leader of the Government in the House of Commons</Affiliation> say at least 10 times that the Liberals have confidence in the work of parliamentary committees, that they respect the committees. Let them prove it. The best way to shed light on this is to allow the key players in this affair, unfortunate as it may be, to give their version of the facts. So far we have only heard the version of Canada's top public servant, the Clerk of the Privy Council. God knows that that testimony was spectacular to say the least, given all the revelations there have been. He talked about the famous phone call that he himself had with the former attorney general during which he said there was no pressure and that he simply reminded the attorney general of the significance of her decision. There was nothing wrong with that. It is just the most senior public servant in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790082">A few days earlier, the Prime Minister's principal adviser had set everything in motion. That is not a problem in the least. It is totally normal.

Political pressure was brought to bear after that. If the Liberals did not like that decision, all they had to do was take action beforehand. They did not abide by their own law and, to make matters worse, they did not respect the integrity of the director of public prosecutions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5790103">Madam Speaker, I am glad to comment on this very important debate. We should all take some lesson in this. There is no satisfaction in a day on which the allegations against a sitting <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> becomes so intense and important that the House of Commons seeks to call that Prime Minister under oath before a committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790104"> We are talking about incredibly serious allegations, about a Prime Minister's story that has changed almost on a daily basis, the story of very well-connected executives being able to lobby a government 50 times in less than a couple of years in order to get the federal laws changed to allow them a plea deal in a criminal investigation, in a criminal case, in which they have been found guilty of bribery and fraud and the constant pressuring of the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation>, which may have gotten her fired for resisting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790105"> For my Liberal colleagues to say that there is nothing to see here because the company did not yet get its plea deal, that it has not yet been successful, the attempt of that obstruction of justice is also a crime punishable by up to 10 years in jail. </ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">It's really frustrating to see the level of mistrust and disgust that Canadians are having towards Parliament, towards the prime minister right now. It's time the prime minister showed some leadership and actually came clean on everything he knew, and the only way we're going to be able to do that, unfortunately, is if everybody testifies under oath.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790108"> Who said that? The current <Affiliation DbId="214115" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. He believed that Prime Minister Harper needed to testify under oath because of a changing story, because the allegations in the Duffy-Wright affair were so significant that Canadians needed to understand that. The Liberals now say that they are different, that when corruption happens with the Liberals, they should not be held to the same standard as everybody else. That is exactly how the sponsorship scandal was born, bred and executed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790109">We are talking about power. The Liberals can continue to heckle, but voices will be heard. We are talking about a very powerful man, perhaps the most powerful man in Canada, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. He is using his solicitor-client privilege not to allow the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> to speak her full truth, which she asked for just last week in the House of Commons. She wrote to the justice committee today. She says that until the Prime Minister is able to waive that privilege, she is unable to fully testify and explain what happened. The one who has the power to allow this indigenous woman, this indigenous leader to speak fully is the Prime Minister of Canada, the only person who has that power. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790110">For someone who professed to Canadians that he would be different, that he believed in transparency, that he believed in the rule of law, the only person who could allow the full story to come to light is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. The irony must be rich for those Liberals, who have talked about transparency, reconciliation and being better than they have been in the past, to watch this whole scandal slowly and terribly unfold in front of their very eyes. We have a woman sitting in the House seeking to speak and a Prime Minister refusing to allow her to do so. If he has a good story to tell, then he can come in front of committee under oath and tell it.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5790125">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to follow up on a question I posed for the <Affiliation DbId="241629" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Heritage</Affiliation> about journalists and media workers who were here in Ottawa at the time with a clear message to the Liberals: Journalism is in a crisis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790126">Government inaction is why newspapers and media outlets are closing and why journalists are losing their jobs. We all know there is so much that can be done to save local news and the government has the regulatory tools necessary to support journalists and media workers. It just needs to use them. One of those tools is the ability to have web giants such as Netflix, Facebook and Google pay their fair share in Canada. They are exempt from Canadian content contributions and this is causing a long, slow drain on the resources that are necessary to keep our local news strong and supported. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790127">In fact, 80% of the advertising has migrated over to these digital platforms and this type of advertising has taken significant revenues out of the pockets of our local journalists and reporters and the ability for the ad buys in traditional media to support the very important work that they do. Other countries have taken the necessary steps to have these web giants pay their fair share when operating in their countries, including in the European Union, in Sweden and recently in New Zealand. Why have we not taken these same steps here in Canada? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790128">We also need to keep our small-market newspapers strong. I represent small towns in my beautiful riding of Essex and I know how hard our local reporters are working. I would like to give a special shout-out to some of those who I see out working extremely hard all around the county: Shelby Wye at the Harrow News; Sylene Argent at the Essex Free Press; Matt Weingarden at the Lakeshore News; Ron Giofu at the River Town Times in Amherstburg; Nelson Santos at the Kingsville Reporter, who is also the mayor of Kingsville; and the LaSalle Post.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790129"> The Windsor Star also serves our area, but extreme cuts have left it with a skeleton of the once-vibrant newsroom it had. I know many reporters, like the brilliant Julie Kotsis-Wilder, who have watched their paper become a shadow of what it once was due to these cuts. That creates tremendous pressure on journalists because it is very difficult for them to do their work when there is so much pressure for them to produce content. We are starting to see that stories are not able to be told because there simply are not the reporters there to go out and cover those stories. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790130">CBC Windsor and CTV Windsor also have reporters who are running around our county trying to tell all of our stories, radio reporters, like Adelle Loiselle at Blackburn News and Rob Hindi at AM800, just to name a few. The stories they tell are the stories of our lives and so important to keep our communities connected and thriving. In particular in rural ridings, this is very critical. Often we have that large hub of news media in the nearest city, but for small towns this is the way they stay connected. They see what each other's children are doing. They talk about the important things that are happening in the town. The five municipalities I represent, extremely active municipalities, need their stories to be told and they need people to be able to access them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790131">It is becoming more and more difficult to tell these stories when the web giants are getting massive advertising dollars and a free ride on our system. I want to quote Jake Moore, who is the Unifor media chair. He was here in Ottawa at that time. He said:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5790133"> Internet companies in Canada should be matching the financial contributions that cable TV companies make to the Canada Media Fund and the independent local TV news fund. New Democrats will continue to stand up for media, for workers and for journalists at a time when free press could not be more critical. When will the Liberals get the courage needed to act?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5790151">Madam Speaker, in October 2018, I asked whether we were going to incur any penalties for the construction delays on the Champlain Bridge. These delays prove that P3s are not actually more effective. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790152">I am not sure why, but at the time, the parliamentary secretary's answer was about safety. Today, I would therefore like to talk about sustainable infrastructure. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790153">On February 12, 2019, I was in the village of Saint-Dominique in my riding, Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, where I held a press conference calling on the federal government to include criteria to promote sustainable infrastructure when awarding contracts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790154">I then had a discussion with the owners of a local family business, father and son Jacques and Frédéric Sylvestre, as well as project manager David Jodoin and R&amp;D director Jean Dubrueil.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790155">I was pleased to learn that this business from my riding supplied the concrete for the Champlain Bridge. Since it hopes to do the same for the REM and can guarantee its concrete for 125 years, I keep repeating that investing in sustainable infrastructure will pay off down the road. I do not understand why sustainability criteria are not taken into account when tenders are put out for federal government contracts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790156">A few weeks ago, the Liberals said that they were in infrastructure mode. It was high time. It is also time for them to be in sustainable infrastructure mode so that all the taxpayers' money is invested in high-quality, long-lasting infrastructure with little environmental impact. It is time for sustainable development to be included in requests for proposals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790157">It is important to acknowledge individual initiatives from companies in Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot. Roller-compacted concrete by the Saint-Dominique quarry is a perfect example of sustainable innovation. Infrastructure developed with rolled concrete is an example of an innovative process that everyone should be on board with, including the federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790158">From now on, we must design and build all our infrastructure based on sustainable performance criteria for the lifetime of the infrastructure and that includes the environmental, economic, and social cost, as much as it includes the cost of maintenance, restoration, or partial replacement as needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790159">Recently at the Standing Committee on Transport, I asked the Parliamentary Budget Officer, Yves Giroux, about including a sustainability criterion in federal government requests for proposals. He said: </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790160">

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790161">In light of this response, the NDP believes that the money required to build sustainable facilities must not be considered only as expenses. This money should be considered as sustainable investments that have significant economic spinoffs, that are environmentally sound and that minimize negative consequences for our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790162">Like my NDP colleague from <Affiliation DbId="214571" Type="2">Hochelaga</Affiliation>, I think that we should ensure that the sustainable development criterion is applied when affordable and community housing is being built. Social housing is important for low-income Canadians. If the housing were to be built with sustainable materials, the upkeep would be cheaper and, again, it would undeniably be good for the environment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790163">In conclusion, the NDP and I believe that sustainable economic development is the future of infrastructure, public transit and social housing. It is clear that in the long term, a sustainable project makes financial and environmental sense.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5790182">Madam Speaker, Londoners remain haunted by the indecision and lack of clarity on the part of the government surrounding the Saudi LAV contract at General Dynamics. While some believe it comes down to a choice between sustainable jobs and respect for human rights, I believe there is a third alternative. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790183">Instead of his typical spin, why does the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> not research his commitments under the contract, determine whether financial penalties exist, calculate the number of vehicles remaining to be shipped and on what platforms the LAVs are built. The Prime Minister must be clear as to what protections he will provide to Canadian workers and the community caught in this mess, which was created by his Liberal government and the previous Conservative government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790184">None of this is the fault of workers, and workers should not suffer in the fallout. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> should be able to find alternative reliable customers for the contract. Canada plans to buy military trucks from the United States, so why not call upon General Dynamics to fill this $2-billion order instead?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790185">Our military is not properly equipped for foreign and domestic missions. The government can change that by purchasing any remaining LAVs for our military and selling or leasing the surplus to countries engaged in peacekeeping. Bulgaria, for instance, is in need of the kind of world-class vehicles produced by General Dynamics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790186">If there are any substantial financial penalties imposed by the Saudis, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> can invoke the Magnitsky act and target Saudi assets to minimize reprisals or recoup the lost funds.

Canada lags far behind the rest of the industrial world, with no substantive digital high-tech communications strategy. The government must make investments in technology, innovation and training for workers to be competitive in the world market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790188">My community of London, Ontario, has the high-tech manufacturing infrastructure to advance a manufacturing strategy, one that is long overdue, and the intellectual infrastructure of Fanshawe College and Western University to support it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790189">The government's lack of leadership has created anxiety and uncertainty for Londoners, workers and their families at General Dynamics, and the satellite industry of suppliers providing General Dynamics with goods and services.

              <ParaText id="5790190">We know that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its crown prince are unreliable customers who have committed human rights offences, bombed Saudi citizens, committed brutal executions and imprisoned and tortured human rights advocates. They have created a war-induced famine that threatens the starvation deaths of 14 million people in Yemen, murdered critics and discontinued diplomatic relations. They have withheld payment of $1.8 billion for the Canadian-built LAVs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5790193">Madam Speaker, human rights are central to our foreign policy. As Canadians, we value our freedom, democracy and the rights guaranteed to us by our charter. However, not everyone is as fortunate. Many people are denied the right to live their lives as they wish. This can especially be the case for women around the world, who are forced to live as second-class citizens. We are using our voices as Canadians to speak up in the defence of human rights, even when it can be very difficult to do so. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790194">Our position on human rights, including women's rights, in Saudi Arabia is very clear. It is a position that we have advocated for in public and in private since we came to office. This dialogue is critical to international diplomacy, because it establishes a common understanding about the value we place on ourselves, on our fellow citizens and on humankind. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790195">That is also why Canada has taken such a strong stance on the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. We are gravely concerned about the involvement of the Saudi government in this extraterritorial murder. The killing of dissidents is horrific and shocking, and it cannot be allowed to go uninvestigated. Murderers cannot enjoy impunity and immunity from consequences. We have demanded a full accounting of the killing in an independent international investigation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790196">Canada is not alone in this matter. Under our leadership, the foreign ministers of the G7 countries have made two separate statements on Mr. Khashoggi's murder.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790197"> Canadians expect that our country's foreign policy respects our values. This is why we have committed to stronger and more vigorous arms export controls. That is why we passed Bill <Document DbId="8886296" Type="3">C-47</Document>, which will allow us to accede to the Arms Trade Treaty and also implement measures to ensure that Canadian arms exports are not used in unacceptable ways. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790198">We have consulted on these changes with industry as well as with civil society. Canadian arms manufacturers also want to ensure that their goods are not misused abroad. The Canadian Association of Defence and Security Industries supports our accession to the Arms Trade Treaty, which puts the treaty criteria, including human rights, directly into legislation. Those were the same changes that the member opposite voted against. She and her NDP colleagues voted against including human rights and gender-based violence as considerations in our arms export system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5790199">Unlike the NDP, we live up to our principles. We are committed to supporting our strong defence industry and the important jobs that it supports. That also includes the significant investments across Canada that we make in our industries.
