              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, the latest budget deficit is massive, and Ottawa expects Quebeckers to foot the bill for spending that does not meet their needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There is no money to reimburse Quebec for the $300 million it has spent on the reception and integration of asylum seekers. There is no money to increase health transfers, which is Quebeckers' top priority. There is no money for the blue line or high-frequency rail in the Quebec City-Windsor corridor. Even new spending leaves Quebec out in the cold.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Ottawa says it will fund rural high-speed Internet, but not until 2030. Ottawa announced compensation for dairy farmers, but there is nothing allocated in the budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Once again, the Canadian government has found ways to drive Quebeckers deeper into debt without even addressing their priorities. We could talk about this all day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Clearly, Quebeckers are not getting what they need from Ottawa.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, over the span of 130 years, 150,000 indigenous children were forcibly taken from their parents and placed in Indian residential schools. The goal was to assimilate them into Canadian society and make them forget their culture and their history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Today, I will be voting in favour of Bill <Document DbId="9093915" Type="4">C-369</Document>, which seeks to designate September 30 as a national day for truth and reconciliation.

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, I invite everyone to join the Canadian Down Syndrome Society in celebrating World Down Syndrome Day tomorrow, March 21. World Down Syndrome Day is observed on March 21 to increase public awareness about Down syndrome, a congenital disorder caused by having an extra 21st chromosome. It is my hope that someday March 21, World Down Syndrome Day, will be as popular as Terry Fox Day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>On my Twitter, I have re-posted a video of a boy named Christopher sitting at a table about to have lunch. Christopher has Down syndrome. Asked if he is bothered by having Down syndrome, Christopher has the perfect answer when he says, “No. Why?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Tragically, most children with Down syndrome will never get old enough to answer this question, because up to 85% of pregnancies with this disorder are never allowed to come to term. Imagine if we had a truly inclusive and just society, one where children with Down syndrome were valued and supported.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, today is the International Day of La Francophonie, a day to celebrate the vitality of the world's francophone community. In Alberta, that community is alive and well. The Franco-Albertan community, like many others, is thriving and growing every year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Our investments are making a difference. Over 30% of children in Alberta are now registered in French-language programs. Thanks to the strength of francophone organizations in Alberta, such as Radio-Canada, the Cité francophone and the Regroupement artistique francophone de l'Alberta, more Albertans can live in French every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Our francophone community is at the heart of our identity, and our investment in that community will continue to attract francophone immigrants to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As a proud Franco-Albertan, here is what I have to say to all those who are watching at home: Whether you are francophone, francophile, “franco-curious” or “franco-queer”, the francophonie and the International Day of La Francophonie are for you.”</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, French is often defined by its vocabulary and grammar, which can be difficult, but it is so much more than that. French may be our language, but it is also our culture, expressed through our poetry, literature and music. It is alive with expressions, regionalisms and imagery, and it is steeped in history. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Language is more than just a way to express ourselves; it also defines how we view the world. It gives us a different awareness, a unique perspective of our environment. The French language gives us incredible opportunities to access far-off places united by a rich tapestry of history and culture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The NDP supports francophone minority communities across Canada in defending their distinctive character and their right to receive quality services in their language. All francophones share a love of this sweet, beautiful language that makes us so proud.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I rise today to wish everyone a happy International Day of La Francophonie. As Michel Rivard said, may it live forever, and may it never be forgotten.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, on this International Day of La Francophonie, I would like to acknowledge an important event, namely the 50th anniversary of the Société de la francophonie manitobaine, the SFM. In 1916, the Association d'éducation des Canadiens français du Manitoba, the AECFM, was founded in the wake of the Thornton Act prohibiting French as a language of instruction. This was one of many statutes that were since deemed unconstitutional. The AECFM laid the foundation for our SFM, which was officially founded in 1968 with a mandate that extends beyond education to every sector affecting the lives of francophones.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Today, our community is growing thanks to strong organizations that support our diverse francophonie, which includes francophones, francophiles, Métis and newcomers. I am proud to be one of the 110,000 members of that community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Long live our Manitoban francophonie!</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, this past Sunday, I was honoured to join in the celebration of life for Mr. Harry Watts, along with Canadians from every province and territory, hundreds altogether. I am deeply grateful and humbled to have known him as a dear friend. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Harry served Canada during World War II as a motorcycle dispatch rider; he delivered messages that were top secret and too sensitive to be sent by way of telegraph or telephone. His book, <I>The Dispatch Rider</I>, sold over 4,000 copies, and all profits were donated to charities. One of his favourite charities that he supported was National Service Dogs, which helps provide dogs to children with autism and to veterans suffering from PTSD.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Harry lived every day to the fullest during his over 95 years of life. Harry's love of God and his strong faith sustained him right to the day of his physical death on March 10, 2019.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I would like to thank Harry's family for sharing him with all of us. They are in our prayers as they journey through this valley of loss and grief. </ParaText>

              <ParaText>French is a noble language with a rich vocabulary, and its complexity is living proof of its strength and history. Let us not forget that French is the language of Molière, Voltaire, Montesquieu and Georges-Étienne Cartier. The International Day of La Francophonie is an important one, not only for the international community, but also for our great bilingual federation, Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As Prime Minister Harper always said, Canada, as a political entity, was first founded by French speakers. Today, over 11 million francophones are living and thriving in our magnificent country. Over 300 million people around the world speak French and that number will grow to over 700 million by 2050.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is important to point out that Canada is the one that pushed the French government to establish the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie in the 1970s. We are one of the organization's founding members, and we must continue to play a leadership role in that organization in the coming years. Long live the Francophonie.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>First, he interfered in a criminal prosecution that led to the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> stepping down from cabinet. A week later, Gerald Butts resigned from the PMO over this scandal. A week after that, the <Affiliation DbId="214288" Type="2">Treasury Board minister</Affiliation> resigned in support of the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation>. Just this week, we saw the resignation of the Clerk of the Privy Council, as Liberal MPs joined in the corruption by not allowing the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> to tell her full story.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The OECD has raised its concern about corruption over this sordid scandal. Even worse, the Liberals on the justice committee have now shut down further inquiries into this matter and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has lawyered up. He has denied from the start that there was anything wrong and is now saying that there is nothing more to see here. So much for transparency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Here is the bottom line. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> thinks he can distract from this corruption with an election year budget, but Canadians are not buying it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, it is clear that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> breached the unwritten constitution.

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to have an opportunity to talk about our historic investments in housing. We are making major investments to help Canadians find affordable housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Our new first-time home buyer incentive will make it more affordable for first-time home buyers to own their own home. It will lower their monthly mortgage payments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We also increased funding for the rental construction financing initiative, which will help to build thousands of new housing units.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We knew that Canada required federal leadership on housing, and we have been living up to that challenge for the past three years.</ParaText>

He refused to testify before the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. He refused to let us hear from his senior staff who work in his office.

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, we have been making every effort to protect workers and jobs since 2015. We will continue to do so, especially since Canadians have created more than 900,000 jobs in this country since 2015. However, we recognized that not all Canadians have access to the training they need to get new jobs. In the budget we presented yesterday, we created the Canada training benefit, which will help workers find the time and money to upgrade their skills. This measure will be a huge help to workers and businesses.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Since 2015, our plan has been working. Canadians have created more than 900,000 new jobs across the country. However, not everyone has access to the opportunities they need. Budget 2019 introduces the new Canada training benefit. This means that working Canadians will get four weeks for training every four years with up to $1,000 in income support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Our job market is changing, and we are going to help Canadians of all ages keep up with those changes. We know this is crucial.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, I will begin by saying that I will split my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="214456" Type="2">Lethbridge</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Today I rise on a motion to get to the truth in the SNC-Lavalin scandal. Here is a quick recap of how we got here. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>A year ago, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had his <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> introduce a budget amending the Criminal Code to allow powerful corporations accused of fraud, bribery and other forms of corruption to get the charges shelved by signing something called a deferred prosecution agreement. We were all wondering where this was coming from and who was advocating for such special deals. We found out in February of this year, when The Globe and Mail reported that the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> faced interference, veiled threats, pressure, hounding and other inappropriate pressure from the Prime Minister and those around him to offer such a deal to SNC-Lavalin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>SNC-Lavalin is a company facing over $100 million in fraud and bribery charges. Among the charges are that the company bought prostitutes for the former Libyan dictator, Moammar Gadhafi, and that it bribed him and his officials to defraud among the poorest people in the world of hundreds of millions of dollars. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was acting in a manner that was highly unusual. To take direct interest in a criminal trial of any kind would be strange on any day, but to try to defend alleged corporate criminals who engaged in malfeasance on this scale was particularly unusual. Of course, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said he did nothing wrong, that the story was false and that his <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> was behind him all the way. The next day, she resigned. The Prime Minister dismissed her, saying that he was disappointed and surprised. We found out later, during her testimony, that he should not have been either. The reality is that she told him that she was worried about the level of interference by his office. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>That brings me to numerous unanswered questions we now need to pursue. First, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said that she never raised any concerns with him at all and that if she was worried about the 20 times his office and his officials contacted her about this criminal prosecution, why did she not say something? It turns out she did.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Yes, she did, despite the heckling against her, again, by Liberal members across the way. Shame on them for heckling a fellow Liberal member. That is shameful. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>On September 17, she asked the Prime Minister, “Are you interfering...with my role as the Attorney General?”, because if he was, she said, “I would strongly advise against it.” The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was stating a falsehood when he said otherwise. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Then he said that it was all about jobs. If this powerful, Liberal-linked corporation did not get its charges shelved, 9,000 jobs would vanish into thin air. When his top adviser, Gerald Butts, appeared before committee, the Green Party leader asked him if he had any evidence that 9,000 jobs would disappear. His answer was that he had nothing specific. That was after two hours of testimony during which he claimed that he was tied in knots about all the families who would lose their jobs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Then we asked Michael Wernick, the Clerk of the Privy Council, who had been involved in all the meetings and proceedings leading up to this interference, what reports he had to prove that 9,000 jobs would vanish. He said that he had nothing in particular. All of this aroused suspicion that the jobs claim was a bunch of nonsense, a suspicion that is supported by a lot of evidence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Let me lay out that evidence. First, the company has the five biggest construction projects in Canada now, worth $52 billion. I want to offer a bit of a hint about how construction jobs work, for our friends across the way. They have to be done where the construction projects are. For example, in Ottawa, SNC-Lavalin has been retained to build the north-south mass-transit project, a $600-million project. It will lay track from near downtown Ottawa all the way out to deep in the south end of the city.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="25">(1525)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>Rail cannot be built in Beijing or London, England and be dropped from a helicopter onto the nation's capital. It has to be built in the city. The same is true with all construction projects SNC-Lavalin is doing in the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The second claim the government makes regarding jobs is that if the company is convicted, then it will lose all access to federal contracts. We now know that is not true. The <Affiliation DbId="233810" Type="4">public procurement minister</Affiliation> is already making revisions to the procurement policy allowing corporate criminals to continue to bid if they get an exemption. SNC-Lavalin already earned such an exemption, or at least was granted one, early in the days of the Liberal government. In fact, it was one of the very first acts the Liberal government rushed to take.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In December of 2015, the company, which had been banned from federal bidding after being charged with fraud and bribery, was then given an exception by the government so it could continue bidding, and it plans to do exactly the same thing even if a conviction occurs. In other words, if the government is just worried about protecting bidding opportunities for federal projects, it can do that without preventing the trial from going ahead. Therefore, that is fallacious excuse is as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Back in September, it was said that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> told the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> that if she did not immediately shelve the charges into SNC-Lavalin's corruption, the company would move its headquarters to London, England. He made that claim twice in that meeting. The Clerk of the Privy Council also made that claim in that meeting. The chief of staff to the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> would go to staff members of the former attorney general and say the same thing. Ben Chin said that the announcement of the move of the headquarters could happen within days and that it needed to be prevented because there was a Quebec election going on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>That seemed mighty suspicious, because a little research on doctor Google would prove that moving the SNC headquarters is impossible. A $1.5-billion loan agreement between the company and the Quebec pension plan requires that the headquarters stay there until the year 2024, another half-decade. The company just signed a 20-year lease on its headquarters there, and is in the process of spending millions of dollars to renovate specifically for the purpose of accommodating its 2,000 employees in that city. It is not only contractually impossible, it is physically unbelievable that the company would leave. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>If people do not take any of that as sufficient enough proof, today the CEO of SNC-Lavalin made clear that was not going to happen. In fact, he was asked where this came from. He said that he did not know how people got ideas like that in their heads. Only the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> knows how that idea came into his head. Today he denied ever making the headquarters claim.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>When one does not tell the truth, the problem is that it becomes very difficult to keep track of one's story. Unfortunately for him, we have him on tape, claiming that SNC would leave Canada altogether if it was convicted of fraud and bribery. He said it in his famous non-apology press conference, where he repeated that false claim that he had earlier said to the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation>. Therefore, we know he was going around stating that falsehood.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is bad enough that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada faces allegations of interfering with a criminal prosecution to get charges set aside. However, this scandal reaches a whole new level of criminal culpability if the Prime Minister or anyone around him deliberately stated a falsehood to a law officer in order to shelve criminal charges. It is an offence under section 139 of the Criminal Code to obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice. Lying to a law officer to get her to set aside charges would obstruct, pervert and defeat the course of justice.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="30">(1530)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>It is possible that during her testimony, the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> did not realize that this falsehood had been stated to her and that it was not true. However, these are the questions we need answered. That is why we need to end the cover-up, let the former attorney general complete her testimony and proceed with an investigation at the ethics committee.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>In the four hours of testimony that was given by the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> before the justice committee, she stated that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> told her this was her decision to make. She said specifically that it was appropriate to discuss job impacts. She said that nothing that transpired was unlawful. Nor was anything criminal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I want to return to the point where she said that it was appropriate to discuss job impacts. The member for <Affiliation DbId="214462" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> has, on repeated occasions in the House, asked questions about why jobs are being considered in this context.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>What I am talking about refers back to the statute. The statute should ground our analysis of what we are talking about. Subsection 715.31(f) of the Criminal Code says that the purpose of this statute is “to reduce the negative consequences of the wrongdoing for persons—employees, customers, pensioners and others....”</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Does the member for <Affiliation DbId="214462" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> agree that citing employees in a statute gives legitimacy to making appropriate inquiries about job impacts? </ParaText>

              <ParaText>Except, Madam Speaker, there were no job impacts. The reality is that the company is not going anywhere. It is required to stay in Montreal under a loan agreement with the Quebec pension plan. As I said, it just renovated its office there and signed a 20-year lease. All of its construction projects in Canada require it to keep its employees doing that work in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Today, the CEO of SNC-Lavalin said, first, that he never claimed 9,000 jobs would vanish. He said that at the very worst, those workers would continue working in Canada for other companies. Second, he said that the headquarters would not be going anywhere and he did not know where anyone would have got that idea.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The member opposite can parse legal language all he wants. Even if it were legal for the Attorney General to consider job impacts, there are no job impacts to consider.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, to answer that question, I ask people to imagine a world in which a prime minister is able to interfere in criminal prosecutions to have charges set aside. Imagine if that were a regular occurrence, if powerful people accused of crimes could knock on the door of the PMO and ask to have charges dropped and the prime minister picked up the phone or met in person with the attorney general and said “make it happen”. What kind of world would we live in if that were how justice is administered? Why would we even have a prosecutor or a judge for that matter, if prime ministers and other politicians had the ability to shelf charges? It is a massive concept.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is mind-boggling that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> thought this was okay. He and his team contacted her 20 times. She documented it. She said there were veiled threats. She was hounded, in her words. She compared it to the Saturday night massacre, which is a reference to Richard Nixon's firings to cover up Watergate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This is not a Conservative spewing these allegations. This is a Liberal, the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> appointed by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. That is incredibly serious.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>He tried to shut down a criminal trial earlier and now he is trying to shut down an investigation of this today. We will not let him. We are convening the ethics committee. It is beginning its investigation. He better show up and answer some questions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, this is about a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who wanted to do a favour for friends. He wanted to do a favour in the form of allowing them off the hook.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In order to do this favour for his friends, he first needed to strong-arm the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> into doing the dirty work for him.

              <ParaText>The <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> faithfully stood in that passageway and she resisted the strong-arming movements of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, his attempt to manipulate her to facilitate his desire rather than uphold justice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We are talking about the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada. This is a leader on the world stage. This is an individual in whom Canadians have placed a great deal of trust. This is an individual in whom we have placed the responsibility of guiding our country. Instead of stewarding this place of trust and responsibility, he has actually abused his position of power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Why should Canadians care? They should care because the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, when he ran for election, made a series of promises, and they were the right promises.

              <ParaText>The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, during his election run, also said this, “Sunny ways my friends, sunny ways. This is what positive politics can do.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Those of us on the side of opposition are asking the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to abide by his words “sunny ways”.

              <ParaText>This matters to Canadians. In the same way they have the opportunity, I daresay the privilege, to elect their officials, they also have the responsibility to hold them accountable. Now, of course, those of us on the side of opposition share that responsibility with Canadians. We, too, will hold the government to account. We, too, will in fact insist that the truth be told, which to date, it has not been.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Let us look more closely at what happened, and to do so, let us look at a number of voices that have been shared. Starting with the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> herself. She said:</ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">For a period of approximately four months, between September and December of 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the Attorney General of Canada in an inappropriate effort to secure a deferred prosecution agreement with SNC-Lavalin. </QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText>She went on to talk about multiple phone calls, multiple emails, multiple text messages, multiple meetings that were held to try to pressure her. She goes on to talk about veiled threats that were issued toward her. This all came out during her initial testimony to the committee.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="40">(1540)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>She also said that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> stressed that there was an election taking place in Quebec and that therefore she needed to do this. She needed to do the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister's</Affiliation> dirty work. That is interesting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>What we have here is a case of sustained and inappropriate pressure. We have an issue of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> actually bullying the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation>, trying to get her to do his dirty work. As a result, we know that the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> was fired from her post as the attorney general and was moved into a different cabinet post, and then she eventually resigned from there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> would try to convince Canadians that there were two different experiences and that her interpretation is simply wrong. However, why will we not legitimize her voice? Has the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> not advocated for all this time that we would listen to the women among us? In particular, I would hope that we would listen to the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general of Canada,</Affiliation> who, I might add, is the very first indigenous female attorney general that this country has seen. Why would we not listen to her voice? Why would we not give it weight? </ParaText>
              <ParaText>When that did not work, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> decided that he would try another excuse. He said that it had to do with protecting 9,000 jobs that exist within SNC-Lavalin, but we know now that is not true either. The CEO of the company has come forward and said that this is not the case at all and that he actually never said that to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Well, that is one voice, the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation>, and of course the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has tried to squash her voice. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>However, out came another voice, and that was the voice of Gerald Butts, the chief adviser to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. His voice said, “I quit”, and he walked out. That is interesting. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Then came another voice, the voice of the <Affiliation DbId="214288" Type="2">former president of the Treasury Board</Affiliation>, and she too said, “I resign”, but she wrote a letter with her resignation. In her letter she said:</ParaText>

              <ParaText>The media have said that “It's fair to say that it's a constitutional crisis.” A former judge said that in an article. </ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I wish I could say it was a pleasure to join in this debate, but there is nothing that gives me pleasure in watching the government performing quite a rare feat. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Oftentimes in the case of a political scandal, we can watch the scandal unfold as this one has, over a number of weeks, and the original sin becomes eclipsed by the actions that follow the original sin. Canadians do not like the cover-up. They do not like the lies heaped upon lies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The government has accomplished something whereby the original sin and the cover-up of that sin might be equally detrimental to people's faith in politics, and certainly their faith in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>My question for my friend is very specific.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>First of all, cabinet confidentiality has been waived a number of times in Canadian history, so the Liberals pulling a muscle patting themselves on the back for partially allowing the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> to speak deserves little credit. The <Affiliation DbId="242093" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice</Affiliation> claimed that the stature of our justice system remains strong. That is not for a lack of effort from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his office to undermine the independence of our judiciary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>If the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> had succumbed to the sustained pressure that she talked about and the inappropriate pressure that she also talked about, what would be the effect on the independence of our courts and the ability of Canadians to believe that there is one set of laws for all people, rather than one for everyone and another for the wealthy and well-connected?</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, that is exactly what is at stake here. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>We see that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada tried to strong-arm the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> of Canada into administering special favours to the Prime Minister's friends at SNC-Lavalin. If we were to give in to a system like this, if the former attorney general of Canada had given in to the Prime Minister's demands, it would result in a justice system that is forever compromised, a justice system with one set of rules for the wealthy, the rich, the powerful, the elite, and then another set of rules for those who do not fit within that category.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I would like to wish all members a happy International Day of La Francophonie.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the principles of cabinet confidence and solicitor-client privilege in a governmental context. I would like to begin with a few words about the important work the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights has done so far.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>As we know, the committee has held, to date, 11 meetings on the subject of remediation agreements, the Shawcross doctrine and the discussions between the Office of the Attorney General of Canada and government colleagues. The committee heard from 10 different witnesses over the course of approximately 13 hours.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>On February 21, that committee heard from the current <Affiliation DbId="245290" Type="96">Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada</Affiliation> as well as the deputy minister of justice and deputy attorney general of Canada, Ms. Nathalie Drouin, for an hour and twenty minutes, as well as from the Clerk of the Privy Council at the time, Mr. Michael Wernick, for an hour and a half.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>On February 25, a few days later, the committee heard from Mary Condon, the interim dean of the Osgoode Hall Law School; Maxime St-Hilaire, associate professor in the faculty of law of the University of Sherbrooke; Wendy Berman, a lawyer and partner at Cassels Brock &amp; Blackwell LLP; Kenneth Jull, a lawyer at Gardiner Roberts; and academic Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, senior associate counsel at Woodward and Company LLP and a professor at the Peter A. Allard School of Law at the University of British Columbia, over the course of a period of about two and a half hours.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Two days subsequent to that, on February 27, the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights heard from the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> for a period of almost four hours as a result of an unprecedented waiver that was issued by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. It was an exceptional waiver that addressed cabinet confidentiality, solicitor-client privilege and any other duty of confidentiality to the extent that they were applicable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>That waiver was indeed exceptional. Since 1987, there have been only four instances of cabinet confidence being waived, and none of those cases, absolutely none, included a waiver of solicitor-client privilege. The waiver was broad in scope, such that no witness was prevented from providing evidence relating to any relevant information during the period covered by the waiver, which was the focus of the committee's review.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As well, in response to this waiver, on March 6 the committee heard from the former principal secretary to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, Mr. Gerald Butts, for two and a half hours, in addition to recalling Ms. Drouin and Mr. Wernick, who also appeared for approximately two and a half hours.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>On Tuesday, Liberal members of the committee sent a letter to the committee chair, indicating that they had achieved their objectives with respect to these meetings. They expressed that following the testimony of all witnesses, they believed that all rules and laws had been followed and that Canadians now had the necessary information to arrive at their own individual conclusions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Yesterday, the committee adopted a motion to move on to a study of how to amend the Canada Human Rights Act “to stem the propagation of hateful acts and incitement of hate”. In my opinion, the committee's timing could not be better, in light of the tragic events that unfolded in Christchurch, New Zealand, last Friday, which bear an eerie resemblance to the tragic events on January 29, 2017, at the mosque in Quebec City.</ParaText>

I am confident that the study by the special adviser, as well as the investigation by the Ethics Commissioner, will be thoroughly and fairly conducted and will provide Canadians with the additional answers and information that they seek.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I would now like to turn to the concept of cabinet confidence and solicitor-client privilege. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, as I was indicating and as members well know, the Canadian governmental system is based on a cabinet system. Cabinet consists of ministers acting in the name of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and establishes the federal government's policies and priorities for the country. Cabinet ministers are collectively responsible for all actions taken by the cabinet and must publicly support all cabinet decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In order to reach final decisions, ministers must be able to express their views freely and openly during the discussions that are held in cabinet. That level of candour is critical to their deliberations. To allow the exchange of views at the cabinet table to be disclosed publicly would result in the erosion of the collective responsibility of ministers and their ability to execute that important function.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As a result, the collective decision-making process has traditionally been protected by the rule of confidentiality, which upholds the principle of collective responsibility and enables ministers to engage in the full, frank, honest and direct discussions that are necessary for the effective functioning of a cabinet system of government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>These are not just words I am reading into the record; rather, this has been opined on and observed by the Supreme Court of Canada, recognizing that cabinet confidences and cabinet confidentiality are essential to good government in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In the decision of Babcock v. Canada in 2002, at paragraph 18, the court explained:</ParaText>
              <ParaText>
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> The process of democratic governance works best when Cabinet members charged with government policy and decision-making are free to express themselves around the Cabinet table unreservedly. </QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText>“Unreservedly” is the word used by the Supreme Court of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>To preserve this rule of confidentiality, subsection 70(1) of the Privacy Act provides that the act does not actually apply to confidences of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Subsection 70(2) of the Privacy Act indicates that cabinet confidence applies to the Queen's Privy Council for Canada, committees of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada, cabinet and committees of cabinet. Committees of cabinet include standing committees, ad hoc committees and any other committees of ministers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In addition, meetings or discussions between ministers can result in the creation of records that are themselves also cabinet confidences, provided that the discussions concerned the making of government decisions or the formulation of government policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>What is a cabinet confidence? They are defined in the act as information contained in six types of documents that are described in 70(1)(a) through (f) of the privacy legislation. The six types of documents do not constitute an exhaustive list, but rather provide a series of examples of records that are considered cabinet confidences.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>This includes memoranda.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Paragraph 70(1)(a) stipulates that the act does not apply to memoranda the purpose of which is to present proposals or recommendations to cabinet. The purpose and content of a document are the determining factors, not its title.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Drafts of memoranda are also confidences. Thus, a draft memorandum that was created for the purpose of presenting proposals and recommendations to cabinet but was never actually presented to cabinet is still a confidence. Equally, a memorandum in final form is a confidence even if it has not been presented to cabinet. Material appended to a memorandum presented to cabinet will not necessarily be a confidence. It depends on the purpose of the document and its placement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>A second category is discussion papers. Paragraph 70(1)(b) stipulates that the act does not apply to discussion papers the purpose of which is to present background explanations, analyses of problems or policy options to cabinet for consideration in making decisions. The Cabinet Papers System was amended in 1984 and these discussion papers stopped being created. Paragraph 70(1)(b) was therefore no longer invoked for cabinet documents after that date.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>In the 2003 ruling in Canada (Environment) v. Canada (Information Commissioner), the Federal Court of Appeal concluded that those parts of cabinet memoranda or records intended to brief ministers, which are equivalent to what were formerly known as discussion papers, presenting, for example problems, analyses and political options, and that are appended to a document, must be identified and processed in the same manner as if they were part of a discussion paper.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There is a third category that includes the agenda and the minutes of cabinet meetings and the records of decisions made in such meetings. Paragraph 70(1)(c) states that the act does not apply to agenda of Council or records recording deliberations or decisions of Council. This type or record relates to meetings of the cabinet and cabinet committees and includes agenda, minutes and records of the decisions made at these meetings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It should be noted that this category will include drafts of these documents and any informal notes that officials take at cabinet or cabinet committee meetings. A distinction must be made between the text of the formal record of decision and the substance of the decision of cabinet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The formal text of the record of decision is always a confidence and is excluded from the application of the act for a period of 20 years. The substance of a cabinet decision may be disclosed to the public as deemed appropriate by cabinet or by a minister with the approval of cabinet.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>A fourth category, records of communications between ministers, paragraph 70(1)(d) of the act, excludes from the application of the act any information contained in records used for or reflecting communications or discussions between ministers of the Crown on matters related to the making of government decisions or the formulation of government policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>A fifth category, again stipulated in the act, is records to brief ministers. Paragraph 70(1)(e) of the statute excludes from the application of the act any information contained in records the purpose of which is to brief ministers of the Crown in relation to matters that are before or are proposed to be brought before the cabinet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This paragraph also excludes information in records the purpose of which is to brief ministers in relation to matters that are the subject of communications or discussions between ministers concerning the making of government decisions or the formulation of government policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>A sixth category is draft legislation. Paragraph 70(1)(f) excludes any information contained in draft legislation from the application of the act. It is not relevant whether the legislation was ever in fact introduced into the House of Commons or the Senate or indeed even seen by cabinet; it remains a cabinet confidence, showing the importance of the confidentiality principle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The operation of subsection 70(1) is subject to certain time limits set out in subsection 70(3) of the act. Pursuant to paragraph 70(3)(a), confidences that have been in existence for more than 20 years cannot be excluded under subsection 70(1) of the act. After that time period, information in the record becomes subject to the act and may be released subject to any otherwise applicable exemptions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Pursuant to paragraph 70(3)(b), discussion papers are no longer excluded from the application of the act if the decisions to which the discussion papers relate have been made public or, if the decisions have not been made public, four years have passed since the decisions were actually made. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Returning to solicitor-client privilege, as we have already discussed, confidentiality in communication between a solicitor and client is premised on the notion that if the consultation between a client and the solicitor cannot be kept confidential, then clients might be less inclined to be forthcoming with their lawyers, thus reducing the quality of the advice that a lawyer can give.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>As one of the many lawyers who has a place in this chamber, I cannot overstate how important this principle is to the functioning of the legal system in this country and the importance of the legal system in this country. It is something that is critical to all parties in this chamber.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>What is important to underscore is that much like the necessity for having frank, open and honest discussions around the cabinet table, frank and open discussions between a lawyer and his or her client are absolutely pivotal to the operations of the legal system and the justice system as it unfolds, whether that is in the civil context or the criminal context.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Over the last few decades in Canada, because solicitor-client privilege is so important, it has evolved from a mere rule of evidence to a substantive rule of law, as well as a principle of fundamental justice within the meaning of section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Supreme Court of Canada has described solicitor-client privilege as “a principle of fundamental justice and a civil right of supreme importance in Canadian law”.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>Given the importance of solicitor-client privilege, the court has often declared that it should not be compromised unless absolutely necessary. It must remain absolute, with few exceptions. As such, the Supreme Court of Canada adopted strict standards for ensuring its protection.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Privilege is attached to every communication between a lawyer and a client that is for the purposes of giving and receiving legal advice and that is intended to be confidential. The privileged nature of a document or the information it contains does not depend on the category of the document but on its content and what it can reveal about the relationship and communication between a client and his or her notary or lawyer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>All communications between a solicitor and a client directly related to the seeking, formulating or giving of legal advice are privileged, along with communications within the continuum in which the solicitor tenders advice.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>Solicitor-client privilege enjoys a status more elevated than that enjoyed by almost any other recognized privilege, given the central role it plays in the effective operation of our legal system. It is in the public interest that the free flow of legal advice between lawyer and client be encouraged and protected, as noted by the Supreme Court in the 2008 Blood Tribe decision, which states, “Without it, access to justice and the quality of justice in this country would be severely compromised.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We have said many times that solicitor-client privilege is an important part of the Canadian legal system and should only be waived in appropriate circumstances. That being said, in order to facilitate the work of the ongoing investigations, we have announced an unprecedented waiver to fully sweep away the obstacles. As I have explained, that exceptional waiver addresses cabinet confidence, solicitor-client privilege and any other duty of confidentiality to the extent that they apply. This has enabled any person who engaged in discussions on this matter to fully participate in the committee process.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>The member talked about the Ethics Commissioner, and I want to ask a question about that. Is he aware that subsection 44(7) of the Conflict of Interest Act, under which the Ethics Commissioner has jurisdiction to deal with reports, requires that the report be provided in the House by the commissioner? </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Sadly, the commissioner is on an extended medical leave. Therefore, is it, in his opinion, legally possible for the commissioner to make a report? The act does not contemplate an interim commissioner appointed by the OIC or otherwise. Could this be done if the commissioner wanted to do it?</ParaText>

However, it should not impede the continuity of the investigation. It is not germane to the identity of one individual. The Ethics Commissioner's office is the one doing the investigation, and the Ethics Commissioner's office should be empowered to provide the report to the chamber if that is what the act stipulates.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, this is my first chance to rise on the matter of supply today. I had hoped to put some of these questions to my Conservative colleagues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There must be more answers to this question. To my hon. friend, the <Affiliation DbId="242093" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation>, I want to suggest to all of us here in this place that getting to the bottom of this is crucial, but we must not jump to conclusions. I am keeping an open mind as to who was calling the shots. Who was it who asked the Clerk of the Privy Council to phone our <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> at home and, for an hour and a half, threaten her? The context of that conversation he claimed he could not remember because we was not wearing a wire.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I want to suggest some other names to this place, names that have not been mentioned. Gwyn Morgan was chair of the board of SNC-Lavalin through many of the periods in which they are now investigated for corporate crime and bribery. He was also chair of the board of governance. Questions, at the time, were raised about his role and what should have been known through the good governance of SNC-Lavalin about the nearly $50 million that somehow got past their notice as a corporation. Is it easy to lose $50 million? I doubt it. They have the same auditor they had in the beginning, with no changes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I mention Gwyn Morgan because he was a major contributor to the B.C. Liberal Party and Christy Clark. Ben Chin, the first name mentioned in the list of 11 people who harassed and pressured our <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation>, was, of course, formerly at the right hand of Christy Clark. In other words, there are plausible trails of those who put pressure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There was the former Harper administration's full engagement in promoting Arthur Porter to a place of honour, even though he was a co-conspirator with SNC-Lavalin.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>In terms of what she has raised about SNC-Lavalin and good governance issues, it is important that the record reflect that concerns about good governance at any corporate institution in this country are pivotal. Some of what has been lost in some of the discussions over the past several weeks on this matter have failed to address or note that even in the context of pursuing remediation agreements, corporate governance and good governance are central.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In the legislation at subsection 715.34(1), it says that any remediation agreement that might be pursued requires an agreed statement of facts, an admission of responsibility, a forfeiture of any benefits, restitution for victims and a payment of a penalty. That is the kind of good governance that all Canadians seek and that all parliamentarians seek in this context.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I wanted to clarify something that seems to be a subject of some debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Before our committee, all of the relevant witnesses as to the facts spoke under exactly the same order in council. All of them had the same waiver of solicitor-client privilege. All of them had the same waiver of cabinet confidence. No witness who came before the committee spoke to the period following the date that the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">Vancouver Granville</Affiliation> became the Minister of Veterans Affairs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Our committee study was on the subject of the interactions between the office of the Attorney General and other government officials. The issue we were looking at was whether or not the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> was pressured in her role as Attorney General in order to reach a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Is it possible that, after she became veterans affairs minister, she could be pressured to enter into a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin?</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, the answer to that, and it is an erudite-type question, is no. It is not possible, pursuant to the law.

That is exactly what the special adviser is looking at because it bears further scrutiny.</ParaText>

He was the person whom, members may recall, Stephen Harper attempted to appoint as chair of the public appointments commission process. The interviews about that process ended the process of having parliamentary committees interview prospective candidates because Gwyn Morgan underwent a rough ride, his heavy support for the Conservative Party being raised as a reason that perhaps he should not chair the public accounts commission. It is entirely possible that the reason there is pressure not to have this go to open court is to protect the reputations of business leaders such as Mr. Morgan.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time today with the member for <Affiliation DbId="214564" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation>. I would like to thank him for his very important work on this particular issue and for his ongoing effort to get to the truth for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I would also like to give a nod to my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214384" Type="2">Victoria</Affiliation>, for his excellent work on the justice file and the incredible level of competence, intelligence and compassion he has brought to this entire affair over the past six weeks. I am quite honoured to be following in his footsteps as the justice critic for the NDP, and as always, I am very proud to stand as the member for Essex.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I rise today to speak to the motion before us that would allow the member for <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">Vancouver Granville</Affiliation> to speak her whole truth. Liberals want Canadians to believe that she has already had her opportunity to do this. They keep repeating the line that she has had four hours to have her say and that is good enough for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>That is not going to get us to the truth. The <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general and justice minister</Affiliation> has said in this chamber and publicly to the media that she would like the opportunity to come back to committee and would in fact be available at invitation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We now know that the committee made the unprecedented move yesterday to vote to end the study and to shut down the testimony about allegations into political interference with the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation>. That is really the heart of why we are here. I hear my Liberal colleagues making legal arguments about precedent setting and expanding what people can speak about under orders in council, but we are here to talk about political interference. We are not here to talk about the Shawcross doctrine. We are not here to talk about a lot of the things the Liberals are trying to change the channel with. Quite frankly, I think Canadians are getting dizzy from their changing the channel. They are running out of channels, unfortunately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Once again today, there was a new development. The CEO of SNC-Lavalin blew apart the argument that has been put forward by the Liberals, and in fact by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, that this is all about jobs and the Prime Minister is just trying to protect Canadian jobs. Today, the CEO of SNC-Lavalin stated that he never told the Prime Minister that jobs in Canada were in danger. He never said that. The jobs argument is not based in fact and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is trying to turn that channel to protect the only job that matters to him, which is his own.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>When the CEO was asked on BNN Bloomberg about whether he threatened to move SNC headquarters out of Montreal, he said no. A reporter asked where the notion that this was a possibility came from, and the CEO responded, “I don't know what people make up”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Once again, we are finding bombshell after bombshell come out in this case, where the Liberals do not want to get to the truth. Now we know the jobs argument is completely false. This was not the argument made by SNC-Lavalin at all, and its CEO has been quite public about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> needs to answer to Canadians regarding why he has decided to bend the truth and create the false argument about jobs and trying to protect them. This argument is quite ironic given the fact that he turned his back on 12,000 Sears workers, GM Oshawa workers and postal workers. The list of jobs the Prime Minister will not protect or fight for goes on and on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Let us get back to what happened at the justice committee. I cannot speak to this specifically, of course, because the meeting was in camera, behind closed doors. In an emergency meeting last week, we attempted to have the conversation about inviting the member for <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">Vancouver Granville</Affiliation> back to committee. Quite publicly, the Liberals used a crude tool to shut down debate under the guise that they needed time to think about things before coming back to committee. They said they had not had time to speak to each other and that they wanted to look at all of the possibilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>On the eve of this week's justice committee meeting, which was to be in camera, behind closed doors, Liberals sent a letter, not to the committee members but to the media, saying there is nothing to see here and that they had already made up their minds. They said Canadians could make up their minds based on what they now know and that was enough. Canadians did not need to know any more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It does not come as a surprise that New Democrats fundamentally disagree with the moves and behaviour of the Liberals on the justice committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It was very clear to me in my new role on the justice committee that the Liberal members are more interested in damage control and protecting the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> than they are in finding the truth. The truth is what Canadians deserve.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>Liberal committee members flat out refused to hear from the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> again, upon being given multiple chances to have her come before committee. They also refused to summon the majority of PMO staffers implicated by her testimony. Instead, they voted to move on, and sent a letter to the media saying that there was nothing to see here. Only three of the 11 people named by the former attorney general appeared before committee. We all know that Mr. Wernick came back again and had right of reply, something the Liberals are denying the former attorney general. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>I cannot fathom what it is like to be a Liberal sitting over on the benches with those members, seeking to have one's truth be told and colleagues are saying that they cannot allow that. It really speaks to the character of members of that caucus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Who have we not heard from? We have not heard from Katie Telford, the chief of staff to the PMO; Elder Marques; Mathieu Bouchard; Jessica Prince, the chief of staff to the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation>; and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself. All of these people who were named by the former attorney general have not had an opportunity to come and clear their names, because certainly some egregious things were said about them. One would think the Prime Minister would want his staff to have the opportunity to clear their own names, to come and state what happened, in their opinion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>I, like the member who spoke earlier, have reserved my judgment because I do not know what has happened. Canadians do not know what has happened. The Liberals are gatekeeping on the truth and not allowing people who are involved in this scandal to come and speak. There could not be any stronger argument for a full independent public inquiry than this, following all of these revelations that keep tumbling out into the front pages of newspapers across our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Liberals are trying to create this concept that there is nothing to see here, that they have done unprecedented things and everything that they can possibly do. That argument is not being accepted by opposition members. It is not being accepted by Canadians either. Everywhere I go in my riding, people are talking about what is happening. People want the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> to have the other half of her story be told. It is being denied to her by her own colleagues, and Canadians see that clearly. They want the truth to come out and they deserve that truth to come out. I have never been more assured that a public inquiry is necessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I want to talk about fairness. The former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> has publicly requested the opportunity to return to the committee, which we now know will not happen. The Liberals keep saying she has already testified for four hours. However, Canadians know there were strict limits on the period of time she could discuss. She stated that over and over during her original testimony. She stated:</ParaText>
              <ParaText>
                <CommitteeQuote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">My narrative stops here. I must reiterate to the committee my concern, outlined in the letter to the chair yesterday. That is that Order in Council 2019-0105 addresses only my time as the Attorney General of Canada and therefore does nothing to release me from restrictions that apply to my communications while I proudly served as the Minister of Veterans Affairs...</QuotePara>
                </CommitteeQuote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText>She herself has expressed to her own colleagues that she would like to come back. Despite the Liberals' feminist rhetoric, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> continues to actively silence her. This is especially unfair given the Clerk of the Privy Council, Michael Wernick, was allowed to testify twice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Why is there one set of rules for powerful men in our country and another for women? The government claimed it would be different, but the proof is in the behaviour of the Liberal government, and women across Canada are not fooled. There is a reason only 26% of us are sitting in the House, and it is not because it has created the climate in the ultimate halls of power here for women to be able to speak their truth. What has happened in this very horrible display for Canadians is that Canadians now know corporations can get into the office of the PMO, can influence legislation and that the PMO is willing to allegedly pressure the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> to bend the rules for Liberals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Canadians deserve the truth and it is time for the Liberals to stop hiding it from them.</ParaText>

Just as clearly said in the very same article was that “some of the 9,000 Canadian jobs at his company are in jeopardy without a resolution to the company’s ongoing scandal in Ottawa”, that “we're in a place here where it is not just about 9,000 jobs” at SNC-Lavalin, that there is a ricochet effect.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, in response to the question that was just asked, I want to quote a top anti-bribery official at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, of which, by the way, Canada is one of the founding members. It says, “the Canadian government should not use the potential loss of jobs as a reason to shelve the criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.” The anti-bribery working group has voiced very significant concern about the way this has been handled and about the fact that it should be an open and transparent investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Does the member feel the investigation has been open and transparent, and we could actually say that to the OECD? How she feels about Canada's reputation now coming into question by the OECD?</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, this scandal is jeopardizing Canada's international reputation. The OECD's working group on bribery is investigating this affair and it was prompted by the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation>'s testimony. We heard that it was ringing alarm bells based on what was happening, but it was reassured because it was being studied at the justice committee, which now has been completely shut down. Therefore, any reassurance that the OECD and the global community had that Canada was taking this seriously has been completely removed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This is why a public independent inquiry is completely necessary now. How else do we prove to the globe that we are serious about addressing these allegations, that we are not just sweeping this under the rug? It is so serious. Canadians certainly know that and the OECD knows that. The question is why the Liberals do not seem to know this.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, as always, it is a great honour to rise and represent the people of Timmins—James Bay. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>What we are talking about today very much needs to be put in perspective. The Liberals will present this as a kind of he said, she said. We had Gerry Butts try to present it like it was one of those episodes on <I>Friends</I>, that maybe if he had been a bit more sensitive at the time, if he had allowed her to just speak more, she would not have slammed the door on the way out. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> did this ridiculous statement about being more compassionate in his cabinet. We are talking about the corrosive power of the 1%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has been willing to burn through his credibility. In 2015, people believed him for openness, reconciliation, feminism, doing politics differently and for showing that it would not be the backroom politics of Stephen Harper and the cronyism of Jean Chrétien. However, he has shown a willingness to give us the worst of both worlds. It was about helping his friends at SNC-Lavalin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>He stood in the House day after day and told us it was about 9,000 jobs, but we now know that was false. We never saw the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> stand up for any jobs when they were Stelco workers, or Sears workers or oil sands workers. Why not Stelco or Sears? Because their pensions were being given over to the family of Morneau Shepell. This is about the power of the 1%. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Now we have the OECD stating internationally that all the alarm bells are ringing over the interference by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in the international bribery case against SNC-Lavalin. The Prime Minister's Office just a few days ago responded to the OECD and promised it a robust, independent set of hearings. That, too, was also a falsehood. The Liberals shut down the justice committee hearings. Why? Because they are doing everything they can to protect the key people around the Prime Minister's Office who interfered with and attempted to obstruct justice. This is the fundamental issue that we have to talk about. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Ben Chin, a public office holder, still has his job. He has not been brought forward to committee. Ben Chin went to the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> and told her that she had to change direction and bring in this deferred public prosecution, otherwise, he said, SNC “will leave Montreal, and it's the Quebec election right now”. Well, we know now from SNC executives that they never said they would leave Montreal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Therefore, when a public office holder presents a lie in order to interfere with the public prosecution, that could be seen as obstruction, and that certainly would be something we would expect the justice committee to care about, but the Liberals shut that down. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The former clerk of the Privy Council had to give up his position because of his role as a political actor. He went to the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> and said that there would be all these jobs lost, which we now know is false. To imagine the Clerk of the Privy Council making this up in order to interfere with an independent prosecution is shocking. Then he also told her on September 17 that SNC was about to move out of Montreal, which we again now know SNC never said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Therefore, this was cooked up in the Prime Minister's Office, a series of lies to intimidate the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> into cutting this deal. She told them they were on very thin ice, that this was dangerous ground to be on in attempting to interfere in the prosecution. No wonder the Liberals on the justice committee did not want this heard. It was because of the damaging, corrosive effect on the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s credibility and a judgment he was making.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>On December 5, Gerry Butts said that he did not like the law, that it was a Harper law and that he could just somehow ignore it. Then he said, when the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> was warning him about political interference, that they would not get through this without “some interference”.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>Fortunately, Gerry Butts has left, but Katie Telford is still there, and Katie Telford said she was not interested in the question of legalities. People who do not care about the rule of law should not be anywhere near the exercise of legislative authority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This is a question the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> needs to be asked. This is why the justice committee should have done its work, but it did not, and it did not because Liberal members on that committee have become hand puppets of the Prime Minister's Office and have disgraced their position and have left us now open to the OECD.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>What do we tell the OECD when Canada is willing to remove the <Affiliation DbId="214323" Type="21">attorney general</Affiliation>, when Canada has a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who is willing to blow through the President of the Treasury Board, the former attorney general, his chief of staff and the Clerk of the Privy Council in order to push through a deferred public prosecution that the prosecutor said SNC-Lavalin was not eligible for? What do we tell the OECD when the Prime Minister is still suggesting day after day in the House that the government is going to go through with this, that it has a new <Affiliation DbId="245292" Type="21">attorney general </Affiliation> and is still talking about moving forward with it? I find this fascinating. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Just what is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> willing to do to get this deferred public prosecution? He has burned his bridges on reconciliation and he has burned his bridges as the feminist Prime Minister and he has burned his bridges with Canadians in terms of trust, yet he is still doggedly pursuing the deferred public prosecution, even though the independent office of public prosecutions had to set up a Twitter account to say that it had to remain independent. That is the issue that the OECD is concerned about. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The OECD says there cannot be international rules of law that allow companies to bribe officials around the world. SNC has been barred for 10 years by the World Bank for corrupt practices. If a Canadian company is going to be charged in its home jurisdiction, it cannot just call the Prime Minister's Office and say “make it go away”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>That is the issue here, which is why five former attorneys general have been asking for a police investigation into the actions of the Prime Minister's Office. Why? It is because the former attorney general for Ontario, Liberal Michael Bryant, said he has never seen such a brazen and reckless abuse of authority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We need the former <Affiliation DbId="214323" Type="21">attorney general </Affiliation> to be able to speak, to respond to the testimony of Gerald Butts, to explain what happened in the period when she was removed. We need those questions answered, and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> needs to understand that his credibility is getting further and further eroded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I heard the Liberal voice for the SNC scandal tell us today that the government now has a special adviser. Oh, my God. How do we explain to the OECD that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s idea of a special adviser is to take someone off the Liberal fundraising circuit, someone who is out raising money for the Liberal Party right now, to oversee this? How can we tell the OECD that this will be a robust alternative to an independent all-party investigation? That does not cut it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Until we have all the participants in this case brought forward and made accountable, until we have an opportunity to understand just how far the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is willing to go to subvert the law, to obstruct justice, and have key staff like the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> and his staff interfere, Canada will be seen by the OECD and other international bodies as some kind of backwoods crony kingdom for the Prime Minister and the small group around him, who protect CEOs of a company that is not eligible for a deferred public prosecution. These CEOs themselves have said that 9,000 jobs are not at risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I will close on this. Just before this case broke, all the senior Liberal cabinet ministers and all the senior officials participated in a special function with SNC-Lavalin. They were the gatekeepers of the great privatization agenda of the Liberal government, but the jobs we are talking about are public jobs. They are jobs that are done by civil servants. They are jobs that are done in municipalities. Then we see the Liberal government, knowing that the company was facing charges, hosting a major event with all key Liberal cabinet ministers and SNC. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>This shows that the government never took the issue of the rule of law seriously for a single minute, and that is what has damaged the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister's</Affiliation> credibility. This is going to drag the Prime Minister down until he comes clean with Canadians about the interference and obstruction from his office.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>I would like to offer a quick snapshot of what we are talking about today. We have a very simple request, and that is that the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> be allowed to speak.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This is not a nothingburger or a distraction, as the Liberal government has claimed it is. We had a <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">veterans affairs minister</Affiliation> who resigned after she lost confidence in this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. We had the <Affiliation DbId="214288" Type="2">treasury board president</Affiliation> resign after losing confidence in this Prime Minister. We had the Prime Minister's best friend and principal secretary resign. We had the Clerk of the Privy Council resign. We had five former attorneys general call for an RCMP investigation. We had a former Liberal attorney general say that if what is alleged to have happened had happened while he was the attorney general, he would have dialed 911. This is a criminal act, he said. We have the OECD anti-bribery and corruption unit watching very closely, concerned that Canada has breached its international obligations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>If all of that is not enough, we had the Liberal-dominated justice committee slam the gavel and pull the curtains shut when we called for the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> to be able to rebut the testimony that was given and to be able to speak without her hands being tied behind her back. The order in council that has been given does not grant sufficient latitude for her to speak about everything that we are talking about today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We have heard the government say that other people have spoken about a time that is not covered in the order in council, and nothing has happened to them. However, we know what has happened to Vice-Admiral Mark Norman. The <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> has very able legal counsel. She has obviously been well advised to tread very carefully and to operate only within the exact confines of that order in council.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The justice committee meeting was adjourned last week when a non-member, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214442" Type="2">Glengarry—Prescott—Russell</Affiliation> was trotted in, put his hand up, moved to adjourn, and the meeting was adjourned 24 minutes into the meeting. It was unbelievable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>While Canadians demand answers and the opposition seeks the truth, we have a government that is committed to a cover-up. It is no surprise, though, and it was reaffirmed for Canadians and members of the justice committee when just yesterday the last meeting of the justice committee to study this very serious matter was closed to the media and closed to the public.

              <ParaText>In this very place, we have asked for a public inquiry and we have given all members of this House the opportunity to support that call for an independent and non-partisan, non-PMO-controlled body to hold that public inquiry, where surely the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> would be allowed to speak and where surely we would get to the truth, but no. The government said no. The Liberal members in this House denied that request.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We asked for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to appear at the justice committee. That request was also voted down as part of the Liberal cover-up of this very serious matter. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>A claim about jobs has been lobbed in response to our concerns, over and over again, by the government. With respect to these 9,000 jobs that Liberals allege to have been jeopardy, there is not a shred of evidence. Not a single line of text or a 140-character tweet, as the government often communicates their messages in, was offered as evidence of a risk to jobs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Since the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> gave her shocking testimony, there have been constant claims of “he said, she said”. In reality, he said, and what the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> will let her say, is the case. That is because the Prime Minister will not let her speak. The gag order is in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Let us look at this “he said, she said”. It began with a Clerk of the Privy Council, Michael Wernick, appearing before the justice committee to testify to his involvement and knowledge of the political interference. According to Mr. Wernick's testimony, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his department continued to pressure the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> even after she told the Prime Minister she would not overrule the decision to allow SNC's case to proceed to trial. </ParaText>

              <ParaText>While acknowledging that there was, in fact, pressure on the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> to overturn her final decision, we also now know that the Clerk of the Privy Council also gave unregistered access to a lobbyist from SNC. The chair of the board was able to make a call directly to the Clerk of the Privy Council on this issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>It was only after a second appearance at the justice committee that we got that answer. As members can see, sometimes these second appearances bear very interesting fruit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The account given by the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> detailing many meetings, calls and electronic correspondence included a cast of very interesting players from the government, including the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>, the Privy Council clerk, the Prime Minister's chief of staff and more. However, the justice committee members have not heard from many of these witnesses, because it would be inconvenient to the government's narrative. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Liberals were very happy to allow what, in many cases, amounted to smears on the former attorney general, saying that perhaps she experienced it differently and that if she did not like what was happening, she should have resigned. We heard from one of the witnesses the parliamentary secretary referenced earlier, a former judge. That judge said that the job of the attorney general in that instance is to stay in place and to maintain the independence of our judicial system by not resigning and by withstanding that pressure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Canadians are rightly concerned about what has happened, and Canadians continue their calls to hear from the former attorney general. The question that has been asked is what they could be afraid of her saying. If she has testified, and they say she has given a full account, what more could she add? We would like to find out. The <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> has said that she has more to add. We are calling on all members of this House to allow that gag order to be lifted and to let her speak.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I thank the member opposite for his contributions today and at the justice committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Some statements have been made, in the context of this afternoon's debate about the justice committee and the work it is doing, that have, in fact, questioned the character of the members of the justice committee. I think that actually does not do fairness, or justice, if colleagues will pardon the pun, to the work they have done on numerous pieces of legislation, including on human trafficking and on access to justice. It has now agreed to a study on online hatred.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The question I have for the member opposite, who is a new member of that committee, is this. If the gravamen of what transpired, going all the way back to that original Globe and Mail article, is the notion of pressure, inappropriate or otherwise, with respect to the issue of a prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, what I put to the member opposite is that the only person who can intervene in a situation about an ongoing prosecution is the Attorney General of Canada. That is pursuant to section 10 and section 15 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act. Once the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> became a former attorney general and was moved to become the minister of veterans affairs, she could no longer be pressured, because she had no statutory role to fulfill. Therefore, what would be the purpose of waiving solicitor-client privilege in respect of things that related to her time as minister of veterans affairs or as the member for <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">Vancouver Granville</Affiliation>?</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, that is very much the issue at hand. We know that the Attorney General is the only one who can grant a deferred prosecution agreement. There was the whole conversation about the Shawcross doctrine, which the judge who appeared before us described as a flimsy argument or legal ground for their engaging in this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>What we know is that the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> was fired for not doing what the government asked. That is why she is the former attorney general. The conversations following her firing, which followed that cabinet shuffle, are germane to this issue. They relate directly to the core of what has happened here. She would not do what the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said, so he fired her. He fired an accomplished minister and former Crown prosecutor and parliamentarian because she would not do his bidding.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>There was a real juxtaposition between what has happened at the justice committee and hearing from my colleague, who is the vice-chair of the committee, and hearing from the Conservative vice-chair as well, that what has transpired since this issue came before the justice committee is a great departure from what they have known and the atmosphere and the character of those other members. This is not about their character, and it is not about what usually happens. It is a marked departure from that, and it very clearly is the effect of PMO interference in the independence of that committee.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, before I begin to lay out my arguments as to why I support this opposition motion, I want to say how disappointed I am with the Liberal MPs on the justice committee who shut down the investigation into the alleged political interference with the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation>. The Liberal majority on the justice committee shut down its own justice committee to cover up the truth, which is truly undemocratic, if not illegal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As extraordinary as the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation>'s testimony was, we cannot forget that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is using his power and his office to ensure that we do not hear the rest of the story. It is unfathomable that the Prime Minister will not permit the former attorney general to answer direct questions regarding meetings and interactions after he removed her from her portfolio that she herself acknowledged were relevant. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>If there was one day to walk into this chamber and check our political allegiances at the door, it should be today. The basis of my speech today is to convince Liberal MPs that they should vote in favour of calling on the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to waive full solicitor-client privilege and all cabinet confidences to allow the member for <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">Vancouver Granville</Affiliation> to tell the rest of the story. We must get to the bottom of the alleged political interference that was put on the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> by the Prime Minister himself and other Liberal government officials, as determined from the provided testimony. Anything else would be a grave injustice to the rule of law and to the democratic principles we were elected to uphold.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I know that constituents have been calling my Liberal colleagues. I know constituents have been calling our members as well. I know that our Liberal colleagues' constituents have been calling, emailing and speaking to them about this serious allegation of political interference. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>When was the last time major news networks broadcast a parliamentary committee from start to finish? When was the last time millions of Canadians read the transcript or followed a committee meeting as closely as this one that took place mere weeks ago? For those who thought this was an inside Queensway story or a story being listened to only by Ottawa insiders, I have news for them. This is not an academic lesson or a political science lecture. This is reality. People are watching. People are paying attention, and people want answers. They do not want the Liberal or Conservative biases. They just want the facts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>If MPs do not stand up today and vote in favour of this motion, I do not know if Canadians will ever get to the full, unaltered truth. Maybe that cover-up is truly what the Liberals want, to turn a blind eye to the truth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I know that if Liberal MPs vote in favour of this motion and the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> is allowed to speak, this could very well put many Liberal members in jeopardy come October. However, if we are only here to make sure that we are re-elected rather than to seek the truth and defend and demand justice, even when it makes us uncomfortable, I would argue that it is time to hang up our coats and call it a day. The strength of one's convictions should allow each and every member in this House to set aside partisanship, even if just this one time, to stand and be counted when it matters most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We were not elected to protect those in powerful positions. Our job is not to sweep injustice under the rug as if it were only a nuisance. We were elected to defend the very pillars of our democracy, the rule of law, and to always put the interests of Canadians first. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>In politics, there are tough choices. Today is one of those gut-check moments when a little introspection would do us all a little good. I want all Liberal MPs to think about how they would vote if this alleged inappropriate pressure was placed on an attorney general under a Conservative or New Democratic government. We all know the answer to that question. We all know that the argument that “it wasn't illegal” is contemptible and downright disingenuous. If there is a bar in determining what is right and what is wrong, then this is a sad day in our democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The reason this issue has been on the front page of every newspaper and in every newscast is that this is not a member of the opposition making these charges. It is the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation>, a current Liberal MP, who is willing to put everything on the line.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In all my years of politics, I have never witnessed anything so stunning as the testimony of the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> at the justice committee. There are a million reasons the government and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> would prefer that she not tell the rest of the story. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>However, I cannot for the life of me think of a single reason, other than to speak the truth, for her to want to come back to the justice committee and ensure that we know exactly what transpired. I will let that sink in for a moment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> knew full well that there were obvious challenges when she previously testified, but she put all that aside. She has faced relentless attacks from some who wish she would just go away. Some have even gone as far as smearing her or attacking her motives. There are some who could care less about the truth and are only worried about their own political survival. Throughout all this, she has risen above these most difficult and trying circumstances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This is why I am appealing to my Liberal colleagues to vote in favour of this motion. The former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> was willing to speak the truth and let the chips fall where they may. I implore her fellow Liberal colleagues to show the same audacity. They should join their fellow Liberal colleagues who have spoken out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>No one is asking any member of Parliament to rip up their Liberal membership or bolt from caucus. I am not asking that they defect or endorse Conservative principles either. This has nothing to do with ideology or even the next election. All I am asking is for members to give their Liberal colleague and former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> the chance to be able to tell the full story. I am asking them to let her provide the necessary testimony for the ethics committee to do its job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>For those who think the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> needs to leave her caucus, I remind them that she did not suddenly wake up and decide she was no longer a Liberal. She is a proud Liberal, and the fact that she wants to run again this October is a testament to her principles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We must rise to the occasion and put aside our political fidelities. Let us call on the government to waive full solicitor-client privilege and all cabinet confidences and let the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> finish her testimony. </ParaText>
