However, it would seem that although our government colleagues across the way put forth this study, when it came time to put the final touches on the report, for whatever reason, they chose to walk back on some of the strong testimony we heard throughout the study.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5798776">This legislation would amend the Criminal Code to require a court to consider that if the victim of an assault is a health care sector worker, this fact would be an aggravating circumstance for the purposes of sentencing.</ParaText>

Over the last decade, violence-related lost-time claims for front-line health care workers has increased by 66%, three times the rate for police and correctional officers combined. National data also show that 61% of nurses experienced a serious problem with some form of violence over a recent 12-month period.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5798785">Today is Rare Disease Day, and acromegaly is one of those rare disorders. Acromegaly is most commonly caused by a benign pituitary tumour, leading to abnormal growth. It can result in the enlargement of the hands, feet and facial features, increased spacing of teeth, and headaches and problems with vision. Acromegaly patients may suffer from complications, including arthritis, diabetes, sleep apnea, hypertension, colonic polyps, carpal tunnel syndrome and enlargement of internal organs, such as the heart.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798786"> Due to the lack of understanding of this disease, it often takes between 10 and 15 years to receive a proper diagnosis. Those left undiagnosed are susceptible to a premature death. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798787">This bill seeks to bring greater awareness to the disease, and therefore better treatment, by declaring November 1 of each year acromegaly awareness day. </ParaText>

The program provides funding essential to education and conservation activities benefiting from Pacific salmon fisheries. Funding cuts to the salmon enhancement program will eliminate education and conservation activities supporting Pacific salmon fishers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5798812">Yesterday, we heard compelling, convincing and very credible testimony from the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> at the justice committee. She told of unwanted, sustained and coordinated pressure that came to bear on her from the highest offices of this country, from the office of the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office, from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself, and from the Clerk of the Privy Council. She told of pressure that came to bear on her to interfere in a criminal trial.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798813">This has caused a crisis of confidence in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and in his cabinet, certainly in the Clerk of the Privy Council, in the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and in the current <Affiliation DbId="245292" Type="21">Attorney General</Affiliation>. Her testimony was meticulous. It was detailed. It was believable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798814">We have over the last three weeks been asking the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> about this. His response, from three weeks to yesterday, has not given us any confidence that he is being transparent. He in fact said yesterday that the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation>, whom he appointed and whom all of us have been trusting, he has been trusting for the last three years, his caucus has been trusting and the country has been trusting, was lying. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798815">Somebody is lying, and I would say that it is not the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation>. We need to find out what has happened, and we need to get to the bottom of this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798816">We heard testimony that the Clerk of the Privy Council, in putting pressure on her, referred to board meetings of SNC-Lavalin. We heard that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, in putting pressure on her, referred to his own re-election.

              <ParaText id="5798819">Mr. Speaker, I am rising on the same matter raised by my colleague, to speak to the importance of this emergency debate because of the unprecedented testimony we heard yesterday about a sustained and coordinated campaign to interfere with an independent prosecution. It puts in question the entire credibility of Canada's justice system and the role of the attorney general.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798820">This warrants that Parliament be seized of this matter immediately. What is really concerning is the testimony that the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">justice minister</Affiliation> gave. She said she had copious notes, and she was very believable, but what she laid out were allegations that are very serious. They include the Clerk of the Privy Council, whose role it is to be the non-partisan voice for the civil service. For him to have sent clear threats to the Attorney General to stop a prosecution raises the whole question of the independence of the Privy Council, so Mr. Wernick is certainly questionable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798821">Ms. Telford said she was not interested in legalities, but she has an obligation to uphold the law if she is in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office. Mr. Butts, according to her testimony, said that he did not like the law, and that it was Harper's law. The <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation>, to her credit, said it was the law of Canada. The government does not get to pick which laws it likes and which ones it does not like. Then Mr. Butts said there was no way this was going to get done without interference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798822">That is a clear statement of the attempt to undermine for partisan purposes, and the partisan purposes go right to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself. He said he was worried as the MP for <Affiliation DbId="214115" Type="2">Papineau</Affiliation> and that this was not going to happen on his watch. He was not speaking in the interests of all Canadians or in the interests of all the workers, who are very seized of this matter. He was looking at it from the point of view of his own particular re-election. That is not acceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798823">We do not get the opportunity to get to the bottom of this at the justice committee, because the Liberals have not allowed the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former justice minister</Affiliation> to speak about what happened in the period between January 14 and her resignation. She has made it clear that something happened in that period, and she quit cabinet. We will not be allowed to hear that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798824">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has refused the independent inquiry we have requested to take this out of Parliament and put it in the hands of a retired justice or a justice official, who could look at this and return. It therefore falls upon Parliament to address this, to look at this and to be seized of this matter, particularly since we will be going back to our constituencies for two weeks. We have to reassure constituents that the rule of law in Canada will not be monkeywrenched for partisan purposes. This is why this emergency debate is needed now.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5798829">Just to recap, Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document>, which is before us today, aims to protect victims of military offences by providing needed updates to the current military justice system. Updating the judicial system of the Canadian Armed Forces can be a daunting task, but those in the service commit their lives to defending Canadian values and beliefs, and it is very worthwhile. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798830">Whether on foreign soil or right here at home, they must regularly deal with the high-tension situations they are faced with. Therefore, their decisions and reactions can often be the difference between life and death, or war and peace. The importance of their work cannot be overstated. As such, they hold themselves to a higher standard. The armed forces judicial system is in place to maintain discipline and structure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798831">I am very proud to say that I represent Canadian Forces Base Shilo, our military base in Brandon—Souris, which is a very important part of our community. Many of us have family, friends and neighbours who serve on the base. They house the First Regiment Royal Canadian Horse Artillery and the Second Battalion Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry. It is worth repeating that the base is the home station of the Royal Canadian Artillery, as well as to a component of the Western Area Training Centre, 742 Signals Squadron Detachment Shilo and 11 Canadian Forces Health Services Centre. Other supported units include 26 Field Regiment and RCA Brandon's reserve unit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798832">Westman is awfully proud to be the home of our brave men and women in uniform. They are an essential and prominent part of our community, and have been for many years. Many develop strong ties and settle here when they complete their service and return to civilian life and retirement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798833">Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> seeks to align the military's justice system with the Criminal Code of Canada. I am pleased to see that it has built upon Bill <Document DbId="8045337" Type="3">C-71</Document>, which was presented by our former Conservative government, and seeks to enshrine the rights of victims in the National Defence Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798834">The main premise here is common sense, which is that victims of any alleged crime should have the right to feel safe when navigating the judicial system. Therefore, I believe it is our obligation to treat them with compassion and respect, and to provide a secure environment so that they may tell their story. Their testimony is essential in better understanding what has occurred, and it is paramount they be able to provide it without fear of consequences and reprisals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798835">Victims are often overlooked in criminal proceedings, with most of the emphasis being on the offender. It is important they be given their opportunity to be heard. The system is there to provide justice, not only for the accused but also for the victim.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798836">In this regard, a key feature of the bill is that it strives to provide better protection for both victims and witnesses in military trials. Military communities are often smaller and more tightly knit. This serves to foster a strong sense of solidarity among those in the service. While they can be an exceptional advantage in the field, those strong ties sometimes make it very difficult for victims to speak out against their wrongdoer. Ensuring that due consideration is given to the safety and security of victims would help give them the courage to stand up and speak out against the injustice they have faced. They should be given every opportunity to be involved in the proceedings. At the conclusion of the proceedings, they should emerge fully satisfied that justice has been properly served.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798837">An important part outlined in this bill is that victims have the right to rely on the assistance of others when dealing with the justice system. If victims are incapable of acting on their own behalf, they may depend on their relatives to exercise their rights. Victims can now look to their spouses, parents or dependents to be their representatives during these proceedings, to help them through the difficult times.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="30">(1030)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5798838">The justice system can be intimidating. It encompasses many procedures, rules and regulations. Victims may not always be fully aware of their rights and can easily feel overwhelmed. Giving individuals the opportunity to request a liaison officer to help them navigate the workings of the case should encourage more people to come forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798839">We should ensure that these liaison officers are properly trained in order to guarantee that they can provide the most assistance possible. A lack of awareness of their rights or of standard procedure should not prevent people from seeking justice. It is important not only to provide safety to those who have suffered at the hands of others, but we must be able to reinforce their belief in the justice system in order to offer them better peace of mind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798840">This would be best accomplished by making the process as transparent as possible. I firmly believe that all victims have the right to request information about the military justice system. They have been directly affected by a crime. They deserve to be assured of the fair proceedings of the case. These are people who have been wronged, hurt and betrayed. They need reassurance and evidence that their belief in the justice system is not misplaced. They need to see justice served.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798841">I understand that under certain circumstances there is a need for discretion. The military conducts many sensitive operations, and often information will be classified to ensure the safety of our troops and our civilians. Those cases notwithstanding, I believe, whenever possible, victims should be provided with information concerning their cases. They should feel completely included in those proceedings and not have to plead for the most basic facts. Victims should not have to rely on outside media or gossip to scrounge incomplete information on a case that may have deeply affected them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798842">The bill would achieve a good balance between aligning with the current military justice system and still supporting victims within that system. The bill is very conscious of the importance of the chain of command within the military, and it makes sure not to impact the system in a manner that would hinder it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798843">The declaration of victims rights contained in this piece of legislation is careful to describe the specific rights afforded to victims in this situation without creating any barriers that might impede the system. I am aware that circumstances in the military may differ widely from those encountered in civilian life, as I have said before. The bill would ensure that the victim's rights are properly represented within the important confines of the current system. It does not interfere with the more unique aspects of the justice system, such as the court martial process or the code of discipline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798844">With the bill, we are taking a step in the right direction when it comes to defending the rights of victims of military offences. However, there is one area of concern with the current legislation that I would like to speak to. It involves the long-term consequences that minor military offences may have on individuals when they retire from service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798845">Presently, there are uniquely military offences that do not have a counterpart in the civilian code. Among them are the five minor offences of insubordinate behaviour, quarrels and disturbances, absence without leave, drunkenness and conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline. These are infractions that can only be committed by members of the military, yet they can result in a criminal record in the civilian world.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5798846">People found guilty of insubordinate behaviour could retire from the military only to have this offence follow them into civilian life. As Lieutenant-Colonel Jean-Guy Perron said in his testimony to the Standing Committee on National Defence on this topic:</ParaText>

Applying for employment or attempting to cross the Canadian border are but two of the everyday consequences that can have an important impact on a veteran's life. Do we truly wish to burden a veteran with a criminal record, when he or she has committed a service offence, which may have no equivalent in our criminal justice system or in Canadian society?</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="5798848">Imagine trying to look for work after leaving the military, only to be flagged with a criminal record due to being absent without leave. A large portion of veterans seek employment in the security sector, which requires security checks. When it is seen there is a criminal record, getting a job is all but impossible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798849">It is important to remember that we have a separate justice system in the military for a reason. There are unique circumstances that apply to our forces that require a separate process to properly address it. It would not be fair to our Canadian Forces members that minor offences that occurred in a very unique setting, a setting known to be high stress at times, remain with them and affect their lives long into the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798850">Lieutenant-Colonel Jean-Guy Perron went on to provide a recommendation to the committee that stated, “The Criminal Records Act and the [National Defence Act] should be amended to only include service offences that truly warrant the creation of a criminal record.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798851">Based on his testimony, there was an amendment to Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> proposed by my fellow Conservative members who sit on the defence committee to address this issue. The amendment put forth would have ensured that those five minor offences I listed would not be given a civil criminal record, no matter the severity of the sentence received. The amendment was flagged to be potentially outside of the scope of the current bill. As such, the committee on national defence did get the opportunity to briefly study the matter, but I would like a more in-depth analysis on the topic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798852">I mention this because I firmly believe that it is an important issue that should be addressed, and that it would greatly benefit the present members of the House to examine. I wholly encourage members to study this subject, because it is a topic that should be reviewed in the near future so that we can do right by those who dedicate themselves to protecting us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798853">There is still much that can be done when it comes to providing proper justice to our brave men and women in uniform.

              <ParaText id="5798876">Over the last few years, I have witnessed a different approach to Canada's military, a positive approach. I want to take a more holistic approach in my address on this legislation. This is an important bill and opposition members have recognized that fact. They too feel this is good legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798877">The bill has gone through first and second reading, through committee stage and report stage. We are now into the third and final aspect of its passage, and that is a good thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798878">Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> is long overdue. It proposes to make our military justice system a bit more in sync with our civil system. There is fairly universal support for the government in advancing the legislation in order to accomplish that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798879">I had the good fortune to serve in the Canadian Forces for a few years. Even though I never experienced it directly, indirectly I got a sense of military justice and the justice regime. I can recall first-hand during my boot camp days the supervisor, or the master corporal in this situation, telling us what our obligations were. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798880">In the military justice world one has an obligation to show up when asked to show up. When members of the forces are scheduled to do something, they best be there unless they have some sort of medical condition or have a very good reason for not showing up. If a member is scheduled to be on duty, he or she is expected to be there. That does not necessarily apply with the same sort of weight in civilian life. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798881">The previous speaker made reference to the idea of being absent without leave. An important part of the training that was instilled in me and thousands of others as we went through boot camp was that there was a difference between military life and civilian life. One of the issues highlighted with respect to that was the idea of the military's ability to provide discipline to ensure its members would be where they were supposed to be. When I reflect on that today, I understand the importance of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798882">Serving in the military is very unique. It is an absolute honour and privilege. As a member of Parliament, as well as in my days as a member of a legislative assembly, I have always, without exception, acknowledged the fine work the women and men in our forces do, whether it is the air force, the special units, the navy or military. I appreciate and value their contributions to our society in both current and past military actions protecting Canadians. Whether in peace missions or fighting the mighty Red River when it has overflowed, our military plays a critical and vital role with respect to our country. We will always be there for our military.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798883">Even though we have only been in government for a little over three years, we have not only talked about taking action, but has also delivered on a number of different fronts.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5798884">What we are debating today is just one aspect of that. It is about military justice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798885"> Let me go back to the training I received. When we were told that we had to show up, that we had to be somewhere, the consequence of not being there could lead to a court-martial and a criminal record. Even though there might be a reason, a relatively weak reason at times, for an individual not being where he or she was supposed to be, it would potentially lead to a criminal record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798886">I believe, as I would have believed back then, that this is not necessarily a fair consequence in all situations. That is why it is a good that the legislation brings the consequences more into line with what happens in civilian life. For example, now much more discretion will be allowed if someone is found to have been AWOL or has not shown up where he or she needs to be at a specific time. This does not mean the individual will receive a court martial. The same threat level is no longer there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798887">Members of the forces are incredible individuals, with a very strong sense of commitment to duty and country. Ultimately this will have a minor impact with respect to service to country, yet can have a very positive impact on what happens when someone from the military retires.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798888"> As we have heard from other speakers, when members of the Canadian Forces decide to retire or have the opportunity to retire, whatever the circumstances might be, we want those members to have the opportunity to continue with successful employment into the future. Having a criminal record has a negative impact on the ability of service members or former service members to get employment for which they are eligible. It is not fair that members of the forces would receive a criminal record for a charge that someone in the civilian sector would not receive. In part, I believe that is why we see good support for the legislation from members of the opposition. We recognize that we can do more to reform our laws that would allow that kind of an issue to be resolved positively.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798889">Insubordination is another example. In civilian life insubordination is treated quite differently than it is in the military. The legislation would also deal with that. This is an opportunity to look at good legislation that advances our Canadian Forces in a positive direction and to get behind it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798890">One encouraging issue in Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> is that we would ensure indigenous sentencing provisions would be taken into consideration. This has been taking place within our civilian population. This is different from what the previous government proposed. We need to understand and appreciate that the indigenous factor needs to be taken into consideration. We see that in our civil court system and it has proven to be successful. Therefore, I am glad to see that in this legislation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="00">(1100)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5798891">There is something we often talk about in the House in regard to legislation on criminal matters. We often hear about the importance of victims and protecting or enhancing the rights of victims. It pleases me that we would establish something new with this legislation within the law on military justice, and that is a declaration of victims rights. That is long overdue. I am glad that we have a government that has incorporated into the legislation respect for victims rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798892">What does that mean? It would allow, for example, the right to have information. It would also allow a right to protection. Equally important is participation in the process. Where it is possible, restitution would be of critical importance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798893">I had the opportunity to serve as chair of a youth justice committee. One of the more progressive changes we started to see at the tail end, before I actually had to leave the committee a number of years back, was the idea of restitution, or restorative justice. As much as possible, that is a wonderful tool that needs to at least be considered. When we think of victims and the idea of restorative justice, we need to incorporate victims whenever we can. It really makes a difference for victims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798894"> I would like to give an example of what that sort of justice means to victims. A victim subjected to an offence is afforded the opportunity to participate by sitting down with the perpetrator and assisting in developing the consequence for that behaviour. At the level of a youth justice committee, dealing with young offenders under the age of 18, I had the opportunity to witness that on a couple of occasions. I was very encouraged by it. The victim was better able to get an appreciation of what had taken place and at the same time feel that the impact on the victim was taken into consideration.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5798918"> There is a code in the military of sticking together. A former veteran told me that he was the victim of a horrific assault 25 years ago by some of his fellow soldiers in his platoon. He was deeply ashamed. He also felt that he had failed his regiment and failed Canada because he was the victim of violence. He did not know how to even respond to this, yet he was the victim and had done nothing wrong. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798919">There needs to be a process so that victims feel that if they are subject to that kind of intimidation and violence, they can come forward in a credible manner and have those cases adjudicated fairly. If people are using violence against fellow soldiers, it needs to be dealt with in an appropriate manner.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5798931">Mr. Speaker, it is a good question. At times, governments will bring in legislation toward the tail-end of a mandate, but generally speaking, that legislation is somewhat known about and the government has the intention and hope of getting support from opposition parties and getting the legislation through. In this case, it was literally the dying days of the Conservative government when it brought in the legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798932">It is important to recognize that the legislation we are talking about that we introduced months and months ago, has some modifications that have really enhanced the legislation. The one that comes to my mind offhand is the indigenous factor, a very important enhancement, something that we think was overlooked. It might have been overlooked because the previous government was in such a hurry to get something together in order to introduce it at the last moment to try to make it look as if it wanted to be able to make a change.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5798941">The legislation would amend provisions of the National Defence Act governing the military justice system.

              <ParaText id="5798942">Before I get to my remarks, I join my leader and observe it is time for someone to take a walk in the snow. Unlike the current federal government that has gone rogue with the criminal justice system, the Conservatives are committed to standing up for victims of crime and ensuring that victims have a more effective voice in the criminal justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798943">I am proud to confirm that it was as a member of the previous Conservative government that I supported the enactment of the Canadian Victims Bill of Rights. Just as I supported victims rights on behalf of the women and men serving in uniform, I support enshrining a parallel victims rights regime in the military justice system. Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document>, to a significant degree, replicates what the Conservatives brought forward in Bill <Document DbId="8045337" Type="3">C-71</Document> in the 41st Parliament. So far as the current government follows our example, those elements of the legislation can be supported.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798944">Unlike the current ethically challenged government, the Conservatives believe victims of crime should not be forgotten in the criminal justice system. Our previous Conservative government focused on restoring victims to their rightful place at the heart of our justice system. That is why we introduced legislation that would mirror the Canadian Victims Bill of Rights and put it into military law. This was the result of several years of work and takes into account hundreds of submissions and consultations held with victims and groups concerned about victims and their rights for the Canadian Victims Bill of Rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798945"> The proposed legislation would give victims enhanced access to information through the appointment of a victim liaison officer, and enhanced protection through new safety, security and privacy provisions, and the like. In addition to being the home of 2 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group and the 4th Canadian Division Support Group, which is made up of 2 RCHA, 1 RCR, 3 RCR, RCDs and 2 Combat Engineer Regiment, as well as 427 Special Operations Aviation Squadron, and 450 Tactical Helicopter Squadron, Garrison Petawawa is also home to the Canadian Special Operations Regiment, CSOR.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798946">The Canadian Special Operations Regiment, CSOR, which was stood up during the Conservative watch of the defence of our nation, is the first new regiment to have been set up in over 50 years. I am proud of the role I played in supporting that decision and the subsequent decision to locate 450 Tactical Helicopter Squadron to Garrison Petawawa to train with the troops. The Chinook helicopters serve as strategic lifts, and helicopters save lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798947">As Garrison Petawawa was the last home of the Canadian Airborne Regiment before it was disbanded for partisan reasons by the Chrétien government, military justice is a volatile topic at Garrison Petawawa. The words “military” and “justice” do not need to be mutually exclusive.

Having suffered physical injuries and PTSD, I have no complaints about anything that I did for the military and would do it all over again.

I expect to be on long-term disability upon my medical release. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798950"> “My issue is this. VAC went through the process to add detainee to the POW policy for compensation. I was at first happy with this change. I was detained by Serbian forces for 18 days while serving with the UN in Yugoslavia back in 1994, with 54 others, only to find out the federal government won't consider a claim until you've been a detainee for greater than 30 days. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798951"> “I feel insulted by this policy. Apparently, fearing for your life for that time period is just not enough, and we did fear for our lives.

Justice in this case is for the sacrifice of 55 Canadian soldiers who were held prisoner as UN peacekeepers during the conflict in the Balkans. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798955">I was also shocked, but not surprised, to learn that the Chrétien government refused to recognize the heroism of all but one member of the Royal Canadian Dragoons battle group who were held hostage, who participated in Operation Cavalier, CANBAT 2. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5798966"> The Auditor General's fall 2018 report on inappropriate sexual behaviour in the Canadian Armed Forces shows that there is a great need for victims' rights, which Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> is introducing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798967">Again, I would like to offer my condolences to the family of our late auditor general, Michael Ferguson. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798968">Operation Honour is a plan to reduce inappropriate sexual behaviour toward women serving in the Canadian Armed Forces. The Auditor General's report found that Operation Honour was severely lacking in providing proper support for the victims of inappropriate sexual behaviour, which includes crimes like sexual assault, rape and harassment. In fact, the report found that Operation Honour was not even designed with victim support in mind and that the services it did offer were poorly coordinated. Even worse, the victims were often not even told that there were support services available to them, despite the legal requirement to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798969"> Disregard for legal requirements appears to be a theme with the government. Victims did not even have a say if their case was investigated, as the vast majority of reports were done via third party from a duty to report, which Operation Honour created. Investigations were undertaken inside the chain of command, whether the victim was ready or even willing to pursue justice for the crime against them. All reports were acted upon. Victims had no recourse to stop the investigation if they did not want to proceed with a complaint. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798970">The Auditor General's report also found issues with the training and briefings given to Canadian Armed Forces members regarding the inappropriate sexual behaviour. He found that the briefings were fragmented and led to confusion, frustration, fear and less comradery among soldiers. Briefings raised awareness of inappropriate sexual behaviour, but did little to nothing to address or bring awareness to changing habits or understanding the root causes of inappropriate sexual behaviour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798971">The report also highlighted a lack of awareness of support services for victims, insufficient training to support the victims and a lack of availability to support those services. People providing services had a lack of subject matter expertise and there was little coordination between the Sexual Misconduct Response Centre, which handles the support services, and the Strategic Response Team, which has the actual investigative responsibilities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798972">Operation Honour was inspired by an investigation and report by former Supreme Court Justice Marie Deschamps. We had Justice Deschamps appear before the Standing Committee on National Defence earlier this month and she gave us her insights as to whether Operation Honour aligned with her original 10 recommendations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798973">It is important to remind the government that for the members of the Canadian Armed Forces, when they put on a uniform, they are soldiers first, and that is an important distinction. In an operational setting, they need to be able to rely on their fellow soldiers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5798980">I was a proud member of the Conservative government when we brought in the Victims Bill of Rights. The then attorney general was very clear that the purpose of the law was to protect victims, not criminals, and that justice needed to be done. That is why I supported the Victims Bill of Rights, because seniors were mentally, physically or financially abused.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798981">I want to correct the parliamentary secretary. He said that the Liberal government created the ministry of seniors. For the record, it was a Conservative government that created the ministry, had the first minister of seniors and also the longest-serving minister of seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798982">I will go back to my question.

              <ParaText id="5798985">However, further to that, there is still a glaring hole in the legislation, in how fairness is applied across the ranks, for example, the right of a soldiers, seamen or airmen to defend themselves. As we saw in the case of Vice-Admiral Norman, there was no clarity on why the Chief of the Defence Staff denied him the funds to defend himself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5798986">This legislation is still lacking, taking away the right of an individual, somebody who has served our military for so many years and with such honour, to be denied that, denying the individual the ability to defend him or herself based on the whim of the Chief of the Defence Staff who takes his orders from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799001">I am very pleased to rise today, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence, to support Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77, an act to amend the National Defence Act and to make related and consequential amendments to other acts</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799002">I want to first acknowledge the hard work that has gone into shaping this bill and getting to this point. Obviously that includes the work of members of the Standing Committee on National Defence and their clause-by-clause consideration of the bill earlier this fall.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799003">I would also like to recognize the work and the outstanding dedication of the members of our Canadian Armed Forces. I think we all greatly appreciate the work they do every day. We are very grateful to them and we thank them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799004">The study in committee made it possible to tweak the language used in the bill for clarity and to debate important ideas raised by the public, particularly with regard to mental health issues. The result is a better bill and parliamentarians who are more aware of these issues. I therefore thank the committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799005"> The premise of the bill is simple. Our men and women in uniform deserve a military justice system that supports them in all they do, a military justice system that reflects Canadian values, works to eliminate discrimination of any kind, and ensures that victims are given a voice throughout the legal process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799006">Through Bill C-77, we are proposing important changes to our current military justice framework, specifically by enshrining victims’ rights before, during and after court martial proceedings. We are also strengthening the summary trial process to ensure that minor cases are disposed of in a non-penal, non-criminal process called summary hearings. In addition, we are seeking harsher punishments and sanctions for services offences and infractions motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on gender identity or expression. Finally, we are ensuring that the specific circumstances of indigenous offenders are taken into account at the time of sentencing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799007">For example, the proposed summary hearings will help improve the flexibility and effectiveness of the military justice system by allowing the chain of command to address minor service infractions quickly and fairly at the unit level. Naturally, the most serious cases will be referred to the courts martial. There will be no summary process anymore, and military commanders who preside over summary hearings will only be able to impose non-criminal penalties for service infractions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799008"> The changes we are proposing are long overdue. We recognize that we need to continually improve our military justice system so that it mirrors the civilian criminal justice system where appropriate, while acknowledging the important distinctions that exist between the two systems in order to account for the unique requirements of military life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799009">Our government is committed to making the Canadian Armed Forces a safe and welcoming place for all Canadians, both civilian and military. It is this same commitment that continues to motivate us as we work to finalize these amendments and enshrine them in law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799010">One of the most important sets of changes we are proposing is the introduction of the declaration of victims rights into the National Defence Act. This declaration mirrors the Canadian Victims Bill of Rights, applicable in the civilian criminal justice system. It enshrines rights for victims of service offences and enhances the support provided to them as they navigate the court martial process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799011">These changes include the right to information, which ensures that victims understand the process and the options at their disposal; the right to protection, which guarantees the victims' security and privacy; the right to participation, which allows victims to convey their views about decisions to be made by authorities in the military justice system; and the right to restitution, which entitles victims to seek restitution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799012"> In order to ensure that victims are able to exercise these rights, they will be entitled to the support of a victim liaison officer. The victim liaison officer will help them navigate the military justice system and inform them about how this system operates. They will explain to victims how service offences are charged, dealt with and tried under the Code of Service Discipline. These are important changes that help put victims first, and I am proud to support them in the House.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="55">(1155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5799013">The second set of changes we are proposing have to do with how the military justice system handles minor breaches of military discipline. Through these proposed changes, a new category of minor breaches of military discipline, called service infractions, will be created. These service infractions will not trigger a criminal record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799014">This change will allow the Canadian Armed Forces to handle minor breaches of military discipline in a fairer, simpler and faster manner. They demonstrate trust and confidence in our military leaders, who can address minor breaches of discipline at the base, wing or unit level.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799015">Through Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document>, we are also working to address issues of gender-based prejudice and hatred in the Canadian Armed Forces. The bill parallels provisions in the Criminal Code that propose harsher sentences and sanctions for service offences and infractions that are motivated by bias, prejudice or hate, based on gender expression or identity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799016"> The Canadian Armed Forces has zero-tolerance for discrimination of any kind. We are committed to eradicating these types of biases in our military ranks. That is why, through this bill and other initiatives, we are working to discourage behaviour motivated by prejudice or hate. This amendment will reflect this commitment and help the Canadian Armed forces continue to make progress in promoting inclusivity. We are ensuring that the military justice system is consistent with the civilian system when it comes to the human rights of the LGBTQ2 community. This bill represents another step in that direction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799017">Finally, we have made a significant amendment to align with the Criminal Code provision relating to the sentencing of indigenous offenders. For Indigenous offenders convicted of military service offences, historic injustices will be considered during sentencing. This sentencing principle acknowledges the historic wrongs that still negatively affect indigenous Canadians across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799018"> These changes will also reflect the government's promise to advance reconciliation and renew our relations with indigenous people. We believe that these considerations are vital to the Canadian Armed Forces’ role in repairing our relationship with Canada’s indigenous peoples. Concrete measures like this will help us strengthen our nation-to-nation relationship and continue on the path to healing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799019">I am extremely proud of the important role that indigenous Canadians play in the Canadian Armed Forces. There are nearly 2,500 indigenous CAF members serving in the regular and reserve forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799020"> These proposed changes to the National Defence Act are key to supporting our women and men in uniform. Our military personnel are at the heart of everything we do. They are at the heart of the new defence policy, “Strong, Secure, Engaged”, because the women and men of the CAF make extraordinary sacrifices every day in service to their country. They deserve a return to a military justice system that ensures their voices are heard. They deserve a military justice system that maintains discipline and efficiency in the CAF while respecting our Canadian values. They deserve a military justice system that provides fair and equal treatment, regardless of race, orientation, or gender.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799021">Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> proposes the changes required to reform the military justice system so that it continues to meet the expectations of the people of Canada and the needs of the Canadian Armed Forces. It presents an approach that is more focused on the victims and protects their rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799022">This bill deserves our support because it seeks to establish a better military justice system for Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799024">As a former member of the Canadian Forces, I am deeply concerned by the state of our military justice system in Canada. We are finding that military members do not have access to legal representation to the same extent that they had formerly. We are finding that operational commanders are recommending to proceed with disciplinary charges and only 50% of cases are actually going through, which undermines the good order and discipline of the military. We have also found that there is a lack of experience among the judges within the military justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799025">Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> does nothing to address any of those systemic challenges within the military justice system.

              <ParaText id="5799038">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to this legislation, which will affect a part of Canada's justice system that is largely unfamiliar to many Canadians, including perhaps some members of this House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799039">Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> makes important changes to our military justice system, bringing it more in line with our civilian criminal justice system with respect to victims' rights and sentencing for indigenous offenders. It also makes this unique system more effective in dealing with minor breaches of military discipline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799040">Our government and the Canadian Armed Forces are committed to maintaining a military justice system that is fair, modern and robust. Canada maintains a military justice system that is separate from, but parallel to, the civilian system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799041">Our department has been active on many issues, including military justice reform. We will continue making equity and modernization a priority as we go forward implementing these important initiatives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799042">Canada has a world-class military justice system, which goes a long way toward helping the Canadian Armed Forces to accomplish their missions in Canada and throughout the world. The system reflects Canadian values and upholds the rule of law while meeting the unique needs of the military.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799043">Some people may wonder why we have a military justice system. The reason is clear. Simply put, we need such a system to maintain discipline, efficiency and morale among those responsible for protecting Canadians, our values and our national interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799044">There are many things that ordinary citizens can get away with doing without being sanctioned, even though those things may be inappropriate or even go contrary to relatively minor federal, provincial or municipal laws or regulations. However, it can be a lot more serious if a soldier does the same thing, particularly when he or she is participating in a military operation. A simple act of insubordination can compromise the cohesion of a military unit that must operate at the highest level of efficiency and solidarity. I am not exaggerating when I say that people's lives may depend on it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799045"> Canada's military justice system is rooted in centuries of practice around the world. Monarchs, army generals and political leaders have long recognized the importance of having a disciplined military.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799046">Just one year after Confederation, the new Parliament of Canada adopted the Militia Acts, which integrated the British Army Act into Canadian law. The Canadian Forces Legal Branch was created in 1918, just a few months before the end of the First World War. This was no coincidence. Canada's key role in the ensuing allied victory was a source of increased self-confidence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799047">From that point on, our military justice system evolved gradually, more specifically with the increased involvement of our military lawyers in courts of law. However, it was always clear that the commanders controlled the martial law system, and they primarily used it as a tool to enforce discipline. The military lawyers representing the Canadian Forces Legal Branch were simply there to advise tribunal members on procedure and evidence and to look for errors in law. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799048">The first big change came after the adoption of the National Defence Act in 1950, which brought the military justice system closer in line with the civilian criminal justice system.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="10">(1210)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5799049">For instance, the act authorized appeals to the Court Martial Appeal Court and brought many penalties into line with those handed down in the civilian system. Only minor amendments had been made by the time two momentous events shook up the system in the early 1980s.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799050">The first was the enactment of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 1982. Another reform stemming from a charter challenge allowed the accused person to choose between trial by a military judge alone or by a judge and a panel of military members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799051">All of these challenges led to a radical change that caused the system to stray from its primary objective, which is to help commanders maintain discipline. This gave rise to a complex, polished system that has adopted many of the characteristics of the civilian system, which is, of course, one of the most widely admired systems in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799052">Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> is the latest step in this process of evolution. If passed, it will make the military justice system fairer and more effective, without neglecting its key role of maintaining discipline and morale.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799053">I firmly believe that the military justice system will remain an indispensable aspect of the armed forces for many years to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799054">By passing Bill C-77 to improve and modernize this system, we will be helping the Canadian Armed Forces continue to meet their many crucial objectives, both in Canada and abroad.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799074">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to support Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document>. It has a title that would not let anyone know what it is about. It is called “an act to amend the National Defence Act and to make related and consequential amendments to other acts”. What it really ought to be called is “a bill to complete the process of military justice reform”. That is the basic reason we in the New Democratic Party are in favour of the bill. We are in favour of it despite its tardiness, and we are in favour of it despite it missing a major opportunity to take an action I will talk about later. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799075">Certain key provisions here are important, and I think we have all-party support for adding these to the military justice system. The first of those would provide greater rights and protections for victims in the military justice system. What the bill would do is align the military justice system with the civilian justice system and align it with the Canadian Victims Bill of Rights. That means that there would be rights for those involved as victims in the military justice system to be kept informed of the progress of their cases and to get key information about the process in terms of timing: when things will be heard and when they will be resolved. This is something that is not in the military justice system presently. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799076">The second of those rights for victims is that victim impact statements would be allowed in the military justice system in the same way they are allowed in the civilian justice system. That is an important reason to support the bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799077">The second reason, which was mentioned just briefly before I stood to speak, is that the bill would bring the military justice system into conformity with the Gladue decision of the Supreme Court in 1999. which allows justices to take into account the circumstances of aboriginal offenders in determining sentencing. The same principle we have been using for 20 years in the civilian justice system would be applied to the military justice system. It is a bit tardy, but it is a good thing to do. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799078">The bill completes most of the military justice reforms that have been worked on for more than 15 years. They were mostly introduced by the previous Conservative government. In its bill, for some reason, the victims rights pieces were left behind. That was a bit surprising in that it was the Conservative government that was bringing forward the reforms, and it was the Conservative government that was the big proponent of the victims rights act. It was a bit peculiar that it was left out, but here it is again. It is a bit tardy, but it is in this bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799079">The government passed most of the major military justice reforms in 2013. Here we are, six years later, still dealing with a bill to complete those reforms. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799080">There are some oddities in the military justice system that would be cleared up here. One of those is the fact that there is no requirement to keep transcripts of all military justice proceedings. A summary hearing can be held without any record of that hearing being held. Therefore, it can become very difficult for anyone to appeal a decision from one of those tribunals when there is no written record of it. That is one of the things the Conservatives brought in in their original bill, which was quite positive, as well as better protections against self-incrimination, which did not exist in the military justice system, even though they are required by the Canadian Constitution and the bill of rights. Those were some of the things that were in the 2013 bill that were necessary. This bill would fully implement some of those changes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799081">What I do not understand is the great delay in getting this done. Both the Liberals and the Conservatives were slow to act on what were clearly needed reforms in military justice. I am not sure why the Conservatives did not complete the job on their watch. They only got as far as Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>, and they introduced Bill<Document DbId="8045337" Type="3"> C-71</Document> in the dying days of the last Parliament, which is essentially the same as Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799082">Having criticized the Conservatives for being slow, I will criticize the Liberals for being even slower, because they had the Conservative bill, Bill <Document DbId="8045337" Type="3"> C-71</Document>. This bill, Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document>, is essentially the same bill, but it took them two years to bring it back to Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799083">The other part of this is that neither the Conservatives nor the Liberals acted expeditiously to get the sections of the original Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> proclaimed. That bill passed in 2013, and it was not fully proclaimed. It was not fully enforced until September of 2018. We had five years before the legislation was actually put into practice. Some of that was through funding not being made available for the necessary changes, especially in terms of staffing the military justice system. Some of that is simply inexplicable to me. I do not know why it took them so long to get this done. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5799084">Again, as I mentioned, it took the Liberals two years to introduce a bill virtually identical to the one the Conservatives introduced in 2015. That makes no sense at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799085">What we are doing in Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> is important, not just in the narrow sense of the military justice act but because of lots of other provisions for military justice and the operations of the military. One of those is Operation HONOUR, which is the military's attempt to deal with sexual harassment and sexual assault in the military. One of the key things here in Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> is that better supports would now be mandated by law for victims of sexual harassment and sexual assault in the military justice system. This is a supporting measure to Operation HONOUR, which has its big challenges. It has not been entirely successful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799086">We had former Supreme Court justice Marie Deschamps before the committee on February 7. It was her report on sexual harassment and sexual assault in the military that sparked some of these changes that are now taking place. What she cited was a reluctance that remains in the military to report sexual harassment and sexual assault, and what she said very clearly to us in the committee was that the solution to that is better support for victims at all stages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799087">Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> provides that support when we get to the formal stages for sexual harassment and sexual assault, but Madam Deschamps was very clear that there needs to be better support for victims before the formal processes begin. That is something that is not in Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document>. That is something that is not mandated by law. However, I do not think that is a necessity. The Canadian Forces could obviously begin to put in place those better supports for those who have been subjected to sexual harassment and sexual assault when they first make it known to their supervisors or to others in the military system. If they make those supports known and make those supports available, we will get better reporting and we will get better handling of all those cases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799088">There is still more work to do before the formal legal stages that are being dealt with in Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document>. I certainly encourage the leadership of the Canadian Forces to act quickly to get those supports for victims in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799089">The other reservation I have in supporting this bill is that it has missed a huge opportunity. That is an opportunity to help deal with another serious concern in the Canadian Forces, and that is the problem of death by suicide in the military. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799090">Over the past 15 years, we have lost 195 serving members of the Canadian Forces to death by suicide. That does not include reservists. The government has admitted that we do not do a good job of keeping track of death by suicide among reservists. The 195 is only those in the Canadian regular forces. We know the number is far larger.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799091">We know that those who are young men between the ages of 25 and 30 are 250 times more likely to take their own lives if they are in the Canadian Forces or are veterans. Something is going on, with the difficult and dangerous work we ask people to do, that results in mental health challenges that we are not responding to in an effective manner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799092">In November 2017, we had the announcement of a joint DND and Veterans Affairs suicide prevention strategy. I applaud the military for having such a strategy. Again, it is a little tardy, but okay, let us get moving on this. Its focus was on providing more support for those who are facing mental health challenges and more training for all staff within the military, including chaplains and others who are assigned to support those serving members, in how to spot signs of suicide and how to deal with those suffering this mental health injury that has led to self-harm.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799093">That strategy, as I said, was put in place in November 2017. Unfortunately, in 2018, we had 15 more serving members and two members of the reserves die by suicide. That is in one year, 2018. One of my colleagues is signalling that the government's count was two, but there were probably actually five—</ParaText>

                <B>Mr. Randall Garrison:</B> Forty-five? Again, we do not have a good count of the reservists.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799096">We know that even though the strategy was put in place, this continues to be a serious challenge for the Canadian Forces. It is a challenge, obviously, on the humane grounds of taking care of those we ask to do difficult and dangerous work.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799100">I do not mean to be too crass here, but it is also a challenge when we invest in people to serve Canada and the result of that service is that we lose their skills and their contribution because of mental health problems. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799101">The Canadian military has said it is committed to removing obstacles to providing mental health assistance for those who need it in the Canadian Forces. When the bill came to committee, I moved an amendment to it that would remove the largest symbolic and practical barrier to providing mental health assistance for those who are considering self-harm. That is paragraph 98(c) of the National Defence Act, which makes self-harm a disciplinary offence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799102">When I talk to people outside the Canadian military, their reaction to this situation is that 30 years ago, in civilian life, we moved way beyond regarding attempted suicide as the fault of the individual and began to treat it as a mental health issue, as an illness that could be dealt with and treated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799103">In the National Defence Act, to which all recruits are trained, it says self-harming is a disciplinary offence. In practice, when I talk to leaders within the military, I hear that this measure is not used very often and is rarely applied, but the fact that it exists and presents self-harm as a disciplinary offence creates on onus on the individual not to seek help, because what they are considering may become not just a mental health issue but a blot on their military career. It creates another obstacle to reaching out for help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799104">We heard moving testimony from witnesses at committee, including Sheila Fynes, whose son died by suicide while serving in the Canadian Forces and who did not get the help he needed despite repeated attempts to harm himself while serving. Instead he was subjected to discipline several times as the solution to his problems, instead of being recognized as suffering from a mental illness and receiving the treatment he needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799105">Ms. Fynes is most dignified and has resisted all tendencies to become bitter about what happened with her son, instead working tirelessly with 161 other families of those who died by suicide to try to make sure this does not happen to any other families. Here is what she said at committee:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799106">Other witnesses spoke from their experience within the Canadian military as commanders who faced these crises. One of those was retired Lieutenant-Colonel Jean-Guy Perron, who appeared before the committee last November, noting that paragraph 98(c) refers both to self-harm and also to asking someone else to do harm. He said clearly that there is no downside to removing section 98(c) as it refers to self-harm and went on to say that if the worry is about someone in the armed forces asking someone else to harm them, that's already covered by lots of other regulations. Assault is the main one that would apply. If a serving member asks someone else to harm them so they can get out of service, that person is already guilty of offences if they carry it out. He saw no downside to removing this section.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799107">The Judge Advocate General's office made it clear that this section is rarely taken through the formal process. In other words, it is not used very often. However, the fact that it makes it a disciplinary offence means that it is sometimes applied at the command level. I think there was only one case in the last 10 years of someone being prosecuted for self-harming through the military justice system, but the fact that it is there as a disciplinary offence allows lower-level decisions that apply discipline rather than assistance to these mental health issues. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799108"> It was a big missed opportunity. The Liberals, as I mentioned, argued that it was outside the scope of Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> to remove this section of the National Defence Act. That was a very technical argument and one that is very difficult for me to accept, in that Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> already amended eight other sections of the code of conduct, so it would have been very easy for the committee to decide to proceed with this amendment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799109">Although the Liberals have not done so and the bill is now before us without my amendment, I still support the bill. I think there are many positive things in it. However, I have introduced a private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="10278439" Type="4">C-426</Document>, which does the same thing. It is a very simple bill. It suggests taking paragraph 98(c) out of the National Defence Act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799110">The Liberals argued at committee that doing it at committee was not the right way or the right place, but they were sympathetic, so my challenge to the Liberals now is this: If the committee was not the right place to amend Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> in this way, will they join the Conservatives and the New Democrats in now supporting my bill to take this section out of the National Defence Act and remove one of the major barriers preventing those who are suffering with mental illness from getting the treatment and help they need?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799111">With that, I will conclude my remarks, and I will be happy to take questions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799112">I am happy the bill is moving forward. I am happy it is going to be done before we go to another election so that we do not have a further delay on victims' rights in the military justice system, but I remain disappointed that we have missed a big opportunity to do something about the crisis of death by suicide in the Canadian Forces.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799118">First of all, the minister wrote to the members of the committee 30 minutes before we were going to vote. It was clearly an attempt by the minister to influence the committee and to not allow the committee to be independent on this issue. That is the first thing I would say.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799119">Second, once the chair ruled that the amendment was out of order, I challenged the chair. We had a recorded vote on whether we would sustain the decision of the chair to rule it out of order. Each and every one of the Liberal members voted to sustain the chair's ruling that it was out of order. Each of those members is clearly on the record as doing so. I know that the hon. member was not present that day, so he is not on that list.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799120">That leads me to my third point. It is that these things happen, but now we have a private member's bill before the House that would allow us to do the same thing. Therefore, I call on those members to support the private member's bill and support the Conservatives and the NDP in getting this obstacle to getting mental health services that people may need out of the National Defence Act.</ParaText>

I do not know if they are present to the same degree that my colleague across the way wishes to see, but what I do know is that over the last while we have had a commitment and a realization, in good part, of 200 additional medical and health care personnel to deal with the situation.

However, one of the things that is most important in treating mental illness as an illness is changing those attitudes. When we enshrine in law that it is a serving member's fault and that they should be disciplined if they are suffering from mental health issues that lead to self-harm and even death by suicide, it is a major thing we could change at this point, which would flow into all of the other things we are doing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799137">Madam Speaker, I want to thank my hon. colleague for his comments, his tireless advocacy and his support for families in bringing their stories to light. He has enabled us to hear what the impact has been on families when we have something in law that does not make any sense and could do more harm than good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799138">I brought this up with the minister when we were discussing the bill earlier in the week, and I want to underline it, because our hon. colleague on the opposite side brought it up. It does not matter how much investment we make in services if people do not access them because there is a stigma attached. We can all agree that there is a stigma attached to mental health; it is the biggest barrier. As my hon. colleague said, regardless of whether the military has ever used this part of the military code to prosecute people, the fact that it is there sends a message to people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799139"> I want my hon. colleague to add further comment on this. The money and the services might be there, but if there is a barrier preventing people from accessing the help, what is the point?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799141">Certainly, what we hear from families is that the stigma prevents access to services. It causes people to hide their problems so as not to lose the confidence of their commanders or colleagues in the military, whereas if they break an arm, they would not hide it but would get treatment. If they have a different kind of illness that is not visible, the stigma makes them hide that illness, so it becomes worse and we eventually lose the services of that member to the Canadian Armed Forces, as well as the loved ones of those families.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799142">Madam Speaker, I would like to inform you that I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="214052" Type="2">Davenport</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799143"> It is great to be in this chamber today and to hear the overwhelming support from all sides of this House on this very important piece of legislation. It is an honour to rise in the House today to share my thoughts on how the government is supporting victims of inappropriate conduct by members of the Canadian Armed Forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799144">When victims display courage by coming forward with a complaint, we must ensure that they are fully supported. Anything less is unacceptable. Every victim, whether a Canadian Armed Forces member or a civilian, deserves to be treated with trust, dignity and respect. We are fully behind the chief of the defence staff and his leadership team as they take steps to root out harmful and inappropriate sexual behaviour in our military.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799145">Since General Vance launched Operation Honour in 2015, we are seeing progress. As former Supreme Court Justice Marie Deschamps recommended in her report in 2015, we put in place a sexual misconduct response centre, which provides support to those affected by inappropriate sexual behaviour. We established the sexual misconduct response centre and extended its services to 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. It is accessible no matter where a service member is deployed around the world. Last fall, the Canadian Forces provost marshal re-examined 179 sexual assault cases previously deemed unfounded, and determined that 23 should be reopened to further investigation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799146">This past May, we introduced Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> to add the declaration of victims rights to the military's Code of Service Discipline. This piece of legislation before us today enshrines victims' rights in the military justice system. This is good news, because it shows that military justice in this country continues to evolve in the best interests of Canadians and the Canadian Armed Forces. It shows the government recognizes the harmful impact that service offences to victims have on the military and on society. It shows the government's commitment to strengthening victims' rights in the military justice system. It is our view that this legislation advances Canada's position as a global leader in supporting victims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799147">The amendments in this bill would strengthen and uphold victims' rights within the military justice system while ensuring that these rights mirror those in the Canadian Victims Bill of Rights. Simply put, the legislation creates and extends rights for victims in four specific areas: first, the right to information about how the military justice system works; second, the right to protection of their security and privacy; third, the right to participation by expanding how victim impact statements can be presented at courts martial; and fourth, the right to restitution for damages or losses. We have a responsibility to make sure victims are treated with dignity and respect. We are taking this responsibility seriously. We owe it to victims and their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799148">In his report last November, the Auditor General included a report on efforts to stop inappropriate sexual conduct in the Canadian Armed Forces. It came with a number of recommendations that will help lay the ground for the next steps of Operation Honour. Canadians can have complete confidence in both the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces to apply these recommendations. The chief of the defence staff has made it clear that serious administrative action will be taken against Canadian Armed Forces members who are found guilty of sexual misconduct. He has zero tolerance for Canadian Armed Forces leaders who fail to act when confronted with inappropriate behaviour within the ranks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799149">When my colleague, the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>, reviewed the Auditor General's report, he had a clear message for Canadian Armed Forces members and victims. He said that this was about making sure we are doing the right thing for victims; we know we need to do better, and we will.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799150">This is why we are moving Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> through this House as efficiently and effectively as possible. It is why we expanded the sexual misconduct response centre, so victims can access support in Canada and abroad 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. It is why the SMRC is looking at ways to enhance service delivery to better meet the needs of all Canadian Armed Forces members, and it is why the sexual assault review program was established to conduct reviews of all sexual assault investigations deemed unfounded by the military police.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5799151">Our government wants the Canadian Armed Forces recognized as a respected leader on this issue, both inside the Canadian government and by militaries around the world. At the same time, we know this is not just a military issue. The Canadian Armed Forces is not alone in dealing with sexual misconduct. It is deeply rooted in society. Sexual misconduct is wrong wherever it happens, but when it happens in the military, it threatens the welfare of all members of the Canadian Armed Forces community, military and civilian alike. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799152">Our people are at the centre of everything we do. The way we support and treat them is directly related to the military's operational effectiveness. It is also directly related to our values as Canadians. The Canadian Armed Forces has put down a good, solid foundation on which to build. Now it is shifting toward sustained cultural change. Later this year, the Canadian Armed Forces is expected to release its fourth report to update Canadians on all progress made to date on Operation Honour, followed by a cultural change strategy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799153">Along with Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> and through the declaration of victims rights, we are strengthening the rights and protections of victims who come forward when they have been wronged. In the passing of this legislation, we are reinforcing Canada's position as a global leader in maintaining a fair and effective military justice system, one that continuously evolves in harmony with our civilian laws. In passing this legislation, we are demonstrating clearly and without question that anyone who is victimized by inappropriate behaviour within the Canadian Armed Forces will be supported fully in the military justice system through these enhanced victims' rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799154">For these reasons, I appeal to all members of this House to support this bill.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799162">Under civilian law, if someone does not show up for work, there is a marginal consequence for that, whereas under military law, a service member could end up going to court and receiving a criminal record. If a criminal record is received, that has a profound negative impact once that service member leaves the military on things such as taking a trip to the U.S.A. or applying for a job. Bringing these things together, military law and civilian law, and making them closer in resemblance would be a good thing for the service member.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799166"> Madam Speaker, on behalf of the residents of Davenport, it is an absolute honour to have this opportunity to rise today and engage in the third reading of Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document>, an act to amend the National Defence Act and to make related and consequential amendments to other acts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799167">This proposed bill amends the provisions of the National Defence Act with respect to the governance of the military justice system and it adds a new section on the declaration of victim rights to the Code of Service Discipline that specify the victims of service offences have a right to information, protection, participation and restitution in respect to service offences. It adds or amends several definitions, including victim and military justice system participant rights and specifies who may act on the victim's behalf for the purposes of that division.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799168">I am so pleased to speak about how Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> is part of a broader effort our government is making to increase diversity and inclusiveness within the Canadian Armed Forces. Canada's unique, diverse and multicultural population is one of its greatest strengths and we are determined to see that strength reflected in Canada's military.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799169">We know that embracing diversity and drawing on all the strengths of Canada's population will enhance military operational effectiveness. That is why Canada's defence policy “Strong, Secure, Engaged” makes diversity and inclusion a core institutional value for the Canadian Armed Forces. Canadians know diversity is our strength, and we will always champion that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799170">A diverse and inclusive Canadian Armed Forces starts with a respectful and open work environment for all. “Strong, Secure, Engaged” has identified several initiatives that will help our military continue to cultivate a culture of respect, and it is delivering on all of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799171">We are ensuring that the Canadian Armed Forces has the ability to respond effectively and appropriately to anyone who discriminates against fellow service members. Through Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document>, we are calling for increased sentences and sanctions for service offences and infractions when there is evidence they are motivated by bias, hate or prejudice based on gender expression or identity. This focus on deterring crimes based in hate for those whose gender expression or identity differ from our own is an important step in the significant progress the forces has made in changing its culture to one of greater inclusivity and diversity. These changes will help the defence team ensure it remains an institution based in honour, integrity and honesty. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799172">However, the changes proposed in Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> are not the only steps the forces are taking. Through Operation Honour, the Canadian Armed Forces continues its vital work to eliminate harmful and inappropriate sexual behaviour. Above all else, it is putting its focus on support for people affected by inappropriate sexual behaviour. That includes expanding the role and mandate of the sexual misconduct response centre, or SMRC, to make it the authoritative voice on victim support and advocacy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799173">As the Sexual Misconduct Response Centre assumes this increased responsibility, it has already established itself as a leader in this field. This past December, the SMRC hosted the first-ever Five Eyes forum on preventing and addressing sexual misconduct, allowing experts from Canada, the U.S., the U.K., Australia and New Zealand to share with, and learn from, one another. These efforts will also help National Defence be an even greater leader in achieving a gender balanced military. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799174">We should all be proud that Canada is already a world leader in this area. As of this January of this year, there are 15,116 women in the Canadian Armed Forces. That is 15.7% of our military, and significantly more than the NATO average of 11%.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5799175">I was honoured to recently visit the Canadian Armed Forces mission in Mali. It is participating in MINUSMA, which is the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission. Right now 14% of all those deployed there are women. That number compares to about 4% for all other UN missions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799176">I know we have a long way to go, but we have already made great progress. We should celebrate the progress we have managed to make.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799177">Through “Strong, Secure, Engaged”, we are increasing the percentage of women in the military to 25% by 2026. That is our target. The Canadian Armed Forces has undertaken a number of activities to meet this goal. I will go through them in a minute.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799178">I want to add that right now the national defence committee is looking at how we can increase diversity in the Canadian Armed Forces. We are looking to put forward a number of other policy ideas and immediate action steps on how we can increase the number of not only women, but those from visible minorities, the LGBTQ community and the indigenous community, among others, in the Canadian Armed Forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799179">I will go back to the additional activities that the Canadian Armed Forces is undertaking to meet the goal of 25% of 2026.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799180">First, it has established a team of representatives from across the military, the federal government and the private sector to examine recruiting strategies for women joining the defence team. We have gone outside of government to get the best ideas so we can achieve our goal of 25% by 2026.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799181">Second, the Canadian Armed Forces has introduced policies and practices that promote a healthy family and work-life balance. I was blessed to join the Canadians Navy on the HMCS <I>Charlottetown</I> during the summer. When I talked to women there, I heard that more and more women were joining because the navy had done a wonderful job of improving the work-life balance, making it easier for people to have families and to support their families while they were pursuing careers in the Canadians Navy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799182">However, diversity is more than gender. The Canadian Armed Forces also has specific initiatives under way to increase its diversity across a broad spectrum of ethnicity, religion, age, experience, language and more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799183">The Canadian Armed Forces continues to modernize, streamline and standardize recruiting to ensure that it is truly welcoming to all applicants. It has recruiters who are multilingual and from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds. These recruiters receive extensive training designed to help them understand and be attuned to cultural norms that may differ from their own background and beliefs. This has helped improve communication with potential recruits, which in turn has alleviated many of the misconceptions that visible minority applicants sometimes have regarding the military.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799184">The Canadian Armed Forces has also made important changes to the way it welcomes people of different backgrounds into the military. While the military maintains strict dress regulations for professional and operational purposes, it refuses to allow those regulations to be a barrier to someone who wishes to join.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799185">As important as all these initiatives are, we also have to recognize the impact of past actions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799186"> In November 2017, our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> rose in the House to issue a formal apology to Canadian members of the LGBTQ2 community for historic injustices inflicted upon them in the country. That included many members of the Canadian Armed Forces who were not just discriminated against, but interrogated and persecuted for nearly forty years during what has become known infamously as “the purge”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799187">We can never undo the damage of this persecution, but we can recognize and remember the pain it caused. We apologized in order for us to move on and make changes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799188">We are doing just that with the Canada pride citation. Members of the Canadian Armed Forces who were directly impacted by anti-LGBTQ2 policies and practices can wear the Canada pride citation on their uniforms. The citation stands as an acknowledgement and reminder of past injustices and as an affirmation of our commitment to ensuring that this dark chapter in our history never happens again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799189">I note that over a year ago, the military launched the positive spaces initiative to promote a safe and inclusive work environment for all employees regarding sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression. I am happy to answer questions on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799190">I am very proud of the actions we have taken to date and I ask everyone in the House to support Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document>.</ParaText>

That is why our minister invited the national defence committee to study the issue of suicide and self-harm within the Canadian Armed Forces, with a view to providing our government with recommendations related to these challenges, specifically as it relates to self-harm.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799203">Madam Speaker, there is a very important conversation that we need to have today regarding the amendments to Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document>, which seeks to amend the National Defence Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799204">The most important thing we have to talk about is why we have a National Defence Act and why people in uniform have a separate judicial system than those in the civilian world. The reason for that is very important. It is that people in uniform are the only people who are entrusted with the right to take a life in aggression, not in self-defence. They are entrusted with the responsibility and sacred reliability of taking a life. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799205">Therefore, as elected officials in a liberal democracy, we must ensure that would never happen without the authority of the citizens, who have entrusted the people in uniform with that responsibility. That is why we have a National Defence Act that separates them from regular citizens, because they have a responsibility and authority that the average citizen does not have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799206"> When we talk about amending the National Defence Act, we have to understand why we have it in the first place. A military is foreign policy by other means. Therefore, when, where, how and for what purpose would we use people in uniform to fight acts of aggression and take lives on behalf of the country? Our alliance in NATO and the Washington treaty, signed on April 4, 1949, after the Second World War, clearly outlines exactly why. It says:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799209"> Therefore, why do we have a military? We have a military to ensure we can safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilization of our peoples, founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law. That is incredibly important to remember, particularly in light of the conversations that have gone on over the last couple of months and the testimony of the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> yesterday.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799210">Our foundation of democracy is based on the separation of the executive branch, the legislative branch, the judicial branch and the military under the National Defence Act. Those pillars are the checks and balances to ensure that individuals are not in a position to undermine the value of these institutions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799211">Individuals take responsibilities in each of those institutions, just like I did when I swore an oath to serve in the Canadian Forces. The oath I swore was not to a person but to the position of Queen and country. I swore an oath to serve and defend the values of the nation for which it stands. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, members of Parliament and cabinet ministers are also not individuals but people who have also been entrusted with the roles and responsibilities associated with their positions.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5799217">Madam Speaker, the relevance is that we have a military to defend the very nature of our institutions, both at home and abroad, because we send them to save the world for democracy. If we do not understand what that democracy is and what they are defending, we risk undermining the nature and value of democracy. We certainly cannot be in a position to amend the National Defence Act if we do not uphold the values and the principles the National Defence Act was put in place to defend. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799218">Let us go to the chief of the defence staff. We have also heard in papers that the chief of the defence staff went directly to unelected officials to discuss an ongoing court case when Vice-Admiral Norman was actually undergoing a trial. For those who do not know, the chief of the defence staff does not report to unelected officials. The chief of the defence staff reports to the Minister of National Defence, under the National Defence Act, and through the minister, to the Governor General and the Queen. That is how we ensure that our ability to use the military is only exercised within its sovereign ranks. Therefore, we need to understand exactly what the chief of the defence staff was doing, potentially breaching the chain of command, going to dinner with unelected officials to discuss things that are within the purview of his responsibilities as chief of the defence staff. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799219">Furthermore, we need to look at whether there was political interference in Admiral Norman's ability to get a fair trial, because Admiral Norman was conducting military operations when he allegedly committed whatever offence he is being charged with, yet the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> has decided not to indemnify him. That means that he does not have the ability to have the military pay for his trial and his defence to ensure that he gets a fair trial. One could argue that this in itself is political interference, because trials can cost a significant amount of money, and this could potentially prevent him from getting that fair trial. Is that a good use of exercising the defence budget, and, under the National Defence Act, access to justice? Those are significant, serious concerns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799220">Now we are talking about amending the National Defence Act, yet these amendments do not remotely address the effectiveness of the act. We found, through evidence, that we have issues with timeliness. People cannot get charges, courts martial and summary hearings in a timely manner. Because we are finding that charges are not being laid, it is undermining the confidence of the military in the justice system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799221">We have judges in the military system who are not getting effective training or experience and who no longer have the extensive qualifications they need to execute on the National Defence Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799222">We are talking about fairness. We actually have people within the military justice system who have been charged and found guilty and have been given a punishment. However, other people have been given a different punishment within the military justice system for that same crime. There is no balance and equity among members within the military justice system or compared to their civilian counterparts or even compared to our allies and their militaries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799223">All those things undermine the code of service discipline and the military justice system we are attempting to put in place, yet none of the amendments to the National Defence Act being put forward today address any of those things. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799224">Even more disconcerting, we have a justice system that is not delivering and executing on that justice, as we have seen in the fact that we can have members of the military who are not being held accountable when they have perhaps breached the chain of command or have acted in a partisan and political way. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799225">Defence is not a luxury. Defence is the foundation of our society. It allows us to have the principles of democracy, individual liberties and the rule of law. We cannot have anything that undermines any of those clear checks and balances and the structures of our democracy, as we heard from the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation>, who was also the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">associate minister of national defence</Affiliation>. Thank goodness she recognized that she had two hats: one as the attorney general and one as the minister of justice. She could understand the rules and responsibilities that came with each of those hats. She knew that she was the last line of defence, the check and balance, that upheld the very structure and nature of our system. She did what needed to be done. She stood up and was counted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799226">We need a military justice system that reinforces the ability to maintain our democracy and the principles for which it stands, and that is at risk right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799227">Defence is not a luxury. Defence allows us to have the freedoms and liberties we have. The more the Liberal government undermines its commitment to defence by not funding it, by giving the military terrible equipment, by not ensuring that the CDS is accountable to the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> and by politically interfering in the trial of a senior admiral, possibly preventing him from getting a fair trial, the more it calls into question not only the individuals and their roles but the very nature of what we are asking people to put on a uniform, swear an oath, serve and defend and give their lives for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799228">Members of Parliament, cabinet ministers and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> are more than just individuals. As we say in the military, I was an officer first, I was air force logistics second, and I was an individual far after that. The same is true of the people who sit in this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799229">There are partisan issues we are going to talk about. We are going to disagree on perhaps how and what and when we should prioritize, but at no time should any of us ever disagree or risk the actual structure and sanctity of the institutions and everything they stand for. If we do, we are no better than all those countries we are so quick to criticize that are not as fortunate as Canada in having democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799230">It is a slippery slope. We have seen over the last 20 or 30 years the lack of independence and separation between the legislative branch and the executive branch. Now we are seeing the slippery slope moving into the judicial branch. With the lack of material in the National Defence Act and the inability of the justice system to execute military justice, it is also slipping there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799231">It is very disconcerting. We have now come to a point when Canadians are giving up. They are looking at government, not only the individuals in government but government as an institution, and saying that we do not know what we are doing, that we cannot be trusted and that we are all the same. If we do not have our democracy, what do we have?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799253">Madam Speaker, I said that defence was not a luxury. The government said that it would invest, but it has not invested by over 50%. It has not even delivered the money it said it would. Of course, worse than that, the government is equipping our military with 40-year-old, used Australian F-18s. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799254">The Australians are smart. They would not be getting rid of fighter aircraft if they were still operationally capable. They are older than the ones we currently own, because they bought them before us. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799256">Madam Speaker, it is important to recognize that the functionality of an F-18 is not necessarily determined by years as much as it is hours flown.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799257">The question just posed was interesting. The Conservative Party was absolutely abysmal. It totally failed on providing. The Conservatives make reference to the aircraft. Stephen Harper was an absolute, total disaster in getting a replacement for the F-18. That is the core of the problem. The attitude of the member's party in not providing the proper resources in the 10 years of Stephen Harper has put the Canadian Forces in the position it is in today. This obligated us to get a replacement aircraft in the short term so that in the long term our Canadian military would be better served by more modern equipment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799258">I wonder if she would agree that Stephen Harper should have done his job as prime minister and invested in our Canadian Forces when it was the right time to do it, which was 10 years ago.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799263">Madam Speaker, I am pleased this important bill has reached this advanced stage in the legislative process. I am equally pleased for the opportunity to say a few words in support of the adoption of Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> and to further illustrate the improvements it would bring to Canada's military justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799264">By now, members have heard a fair bit of detail about how the bill would further modernize the military justice system; how it would ensure our military justice system would continue to evolve in harmony with the civilian justice system, while continuing to respond to the unique needs of our military; how it would enshrine victims' rights within the military justice system and ensure they would be well supported at all stages; and how it would support our government's commitment to repairing our nation-to-nation relationship with indigenous and protecting LGBTQ2 individuals from discrimination and injustices based on their gender expression or identity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799265">Those are all much-needed steps to strengthen our military justice system to ensure it is responsive and reflective of our deeply held Canadian values and of our number one priority, to care for our people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799266">However, there are other important changes in the bill, changes that will help streamline our military justice process, changes that will make those processes more efficient and better suited to meet the demands of a modern military. Today I would like to re-examine some of those changes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799267">The legislation before us promises to reform the summary trial process in ways that will enhance the military's ability to maintain fast, fair and effective discipline. Canadians, military and civilian alike deserve a military justice system that is responsive to operational demands and that applies fair and proportionate disciplinary measures when dealing with minor breaches of military discipline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799268">Our proposed changes will simplify the process of dealing with minor breaches of military discipline by replacing the current summary trial process with a new system of summary hearings, while continuing to process more serious breaches of military discipline through the court martial system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799269">These summary hearings would make it much easier for the Canadian Armed Forces to address minor breaches in a fair and timely manner. Summary trials have generally tended to comprise approximately 90% of all service tribunals. Courts martial have made up just one-tenth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799270">By creating the new summary hearing process, Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> would enable simpler and faster handling of minor breaches of military discipline. As members have heard us say before, this new process would be non-penal and non-criminal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799271">It would focus exclusively on minor breaches of military discipline. These minor breaches, called service infractions, would be created in regulation and dealt with exclusively through summary hearings. They would not be considered criminal offences, so they would be dealt with swiftly and fairly at the unit level.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799272">Sanctions may be imposed in respect of a service infraction, such as reduction in rank, reprimands, deprivation of pay or minor sanctions that are non-penal, non-criminal and that would be prescribed in the regulations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799273">Under the proposed changes, the new summary hearing will be conducted by officers who will have jurisdiction if the person charged is one rank below the officer conducting the hearing or if he or she is a non-commissioned member. That means military commanders will have more flexibility and thus be better able to maintain discipline, efficiency and morale. In this way, the summary hearing process will maintain the current responsiveness, while enhancing operational effectiveness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799274">At the same time, the proposed reforms show trust and confidence in our military leaders and their ability to address minor breaches of military discipline. Of course the more serious breaches of military discipline, known as service offences, would continue to be tried under our system of courts martial.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799275">All of that means greater efficiency within the broader military justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799276"> Our military justice system is unique and necessary to meet the needs of our armed forces. The Supreme Court has affirmed this on a number of occasions. It is the solemn duty and responsibility of everyone here in this room to ensure we are supporting a military justice system that is set up to preserve the highest standards of conduct and discipline. We owe that to our armed forces, which must remain ready at all times to act decisively and effectively in service to their country.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5799277">Just as the civilian criminal justice system has progressed to reflect our current times, so too must the military justice system continually evolve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799278">Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document>'s proposed summary trial reform is about making that system simpler, more effective and more efficient. It is about making sure breaches of military discipline are dealt with appropriately and effectively, based on their severity. A new summary hearing process would help preserve discipline and morale at the unit level, with sanctions that are non-penal and non-criminal and would not trigger detention or criminal record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799279">It would improve the chain of command's ability to address minor breaches of military discipline swiftly and fairly, which would enhance the operational effectiveness of the Canadian Armed Forces. All told, the legislation would create a fairer, faster and more flexible process, one that reflects our Canadian values while staying responsive to the unique needs of our military.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799280">Through our defence policy “Strong, Secure, Engaged”, our government is demonstrating its unwavering commitment to supporting the women and men of the Canadian Armed Forces. The bill offers more opportunity for all of us to reaffirm our people are our number one priority. The bill is essential to ensuring our military members have the support and systems they need to remain ready to defend and protect Canadians at home and abroad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799281">I am proud to be part of these efforts, and I thank my colleagues for their support in passing this important legislation.</ParaText>

That would then lead to a criminal record. Comparing that to the civilian world, if someone does not show up for work, he or she will not have a criminal record as a result. When we talk about modernization, having the current law better reflect some of the aspects of civilian law, this is a good example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799295">I wonder if my colleague would provide his thoughts on someone not showing up for work. We understand and appreciate the difference between military service and civilian service, but at least there would be much more discretion to allow someone who is absent without leave the opportunity to have a disposition that does not allow for a criminal record, which is of benefit. That is one aspect of the legislation that is really encouraging.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799297">We want to deal with an issue like skipping class at a summary hearing in a way that is proportional and reflects the nature of the offence committed, rather than bringing it to a court martial, destroying a career and negatively impacting that person. The bill would give the commander the ability to deal with that in a proportional way and provide greater flexibility to deal with it and truly have justice, especially in minor cases like that.

              <ParaText id="5799311">Mr. Speaker, this week the Government of Canada announced $1.6 million in funding to support the Kivalliq hydro-fibre link. This project will significantly reduce Nunavut's dependency on fossil fuels and for the first time bring reliable Internet connectivity to communities in the Kivalliq region. This represents a big step toward building a sustainable economy for Nunavut, and I was proud to be a part of that effort.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799312">However, a sustainable economy also requires the kind of social service supports most Canadians take for granted. In Nunavut there is not one mental health and addictions treatment facility, despite the fact that we have the highest suicide rate in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799313">Addictions are causing untold damage to families and communities, tearing at the very fabric of our society. It took Canada decades to get on board with the hydro-fibre link project. I can only hope they will recognize this urgent need and work with the Government of Nunavut to make a mental health and addictions treatment facility a reality.</ParaText>

We are fortunate to have two organizations whose members devote much of their time and energy to protecting these two lakes. Memphremagog Conservation, which is led by Robert Benoit, works for the protection of Lake Memphremagog, which includes the issue of the Coventry landfill in Vermont. Five mayors of villages along Lake Champlain formed Actions Lac Champlain. This group is committed to doing what it takes to clean up the lake water.</ParaText>

The lake is a popular tourist draw during the summer, so it contributes greatly to the region’s vitality. As a result, it is vital we look after the quality of the water, especially since it is the source of drinking water for the towns of Bedford and Saint-Armand. Cleaning up this lake is a priority for the region.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799325">Mr. Speaker, last week the Vancouver School Board released a facilities plan naming some two dozen elementary and high schools that are in danger of being closed. This is the third time in 10 years that schools are at risk of being shut down, depriving thousands of students the opportunity to attend a quality school in their own neighbourhood.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799326"> Many of these schools are slated for closure because they are at high risk in an earthquake. British Columbia sits on seismically active areas, and the next major earthquake is only a matter of time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799327"> The federal government plays an important role in emergency preparedness and ensuring the public safety of all Canadians. Parents expect their government to take every precaution to keep our children safe. That is why the seismic needs of Vancouver schools must be a top priority for all levels of government, including this one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799328">Today, I am once again calling on the federal government to make funds available to help seismically upgrade B.C. schools, so that every child can attend a neighbourhood school and receive a quality education in safety.</ParaText>

However, while thousands in my riding agonize over future job prospects, retraining supports and their children's future, we see absolutely no sense of urgency from the ministers of industry or finance, or even the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself. He did not even bother to show up. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799360">Hard-working families in Oshawa and across our country desperately need immediate action on lower taxes, infrastructure and an immediate end to the unfair U.S. steel tariffs ravaging our industrial sector. If we add in the uncertainty of a carbon tax and the future of Oshawa's port, we see why families are worried. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799361">Canadian families need a government that works for them, not a protection racket in the PMO. It is time for Conservative economic policies that will again make life more affordable for working families in Oshawa and across the country. </ParaText>

The answer is simple. The best way to fight measles is by getting the measles vaccination.

Our government knows this, which is why we have committed $25 million over five years to get more Canadians vaccinated. The evidence is clear.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5799609">Mr. Speaker, my point of order relates to the meeting held by the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration on Monday, February 25.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799610">I understand that the Speaker does not normally become involved with committees, but there are occasions when the Speaker is obliged to intervene, and I will lay out why I believe this situation constitutes such an occasion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799611">First, the Speaker may intervene in cases when committees adopt amendments to bills that go beyond the scope of the bill or require a royal recommendation. The Speaker may intervene as well when committees attempt to operate outside the authority granted to them by the House. My point of order relates to such an occasion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799612">To cite precedent in support of my case, on June 20, 1994, and again on November 7, 1996, the Speaker ruled that:</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799614">I would also refer you, Mr. Speaker, to Standing Order 116(1), which states:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799615">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">In a standing, special or legislative committee, the Standing Orders shall apply so far as may be applicable, except the Standing Orders as to the election of a Speaker, seconding of motions, limiting the number of times of speaking and the length of speeches.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799616">As such, I ask you, Mr. Speaker, to examine the following situation and provide a ruling in the context of the two points I have just stated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799617">The Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration on Monday, February 25, was interrupted by votes. The chair suspended the meeting at this point in time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799618">At the time of the suspension, a motion had been moved and was being debated. After, not prior to, gavelling the meeting suspended, the chair indicated that the committee would reconvene after the vote. When members returned to the committee room, we waited some time for the quorum to be met, which never occurred. Finally, the chair decided to leave the room without ever reconvening or ending the meeting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799619">I assumed that the meeting would continue at our next scheduled meeting on Wednesday. Conservative members came to this meeting prepared to continue debate on the motion that was being discussed on Monday, given that the meeting was suspended. To our surprise, the chair informed us that the meeting on Monday had been adjourned, despite the suspended meeting never having been reconvened. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799620">I find this unilateral decision of the chair to adjourn a meeting outside a committee meeting and without the support of the committee members to be disturbing and in violation of the rules governing such meetings, and potentially a damaging precedent for future Parliaments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799621">When the committee met again, Conservatives raised a point of order to ask that meeting number 145 continue, as it was suspended and not resumed, and that the member for <Affiliation DbId="214409" Type="2">Brandon—Souris</Affiliation> be allowed to resume where he left off. When this request was denied, we challenged the chair's ruling. The ruling was sustained by Liberal members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799622">While I appreciate that in upholding the ruling of the chair, the committee in effect made a decision and that in the normal course of things, it should be left at that. However, on the strength of the Standing Orders, the chair was prohibited from terminating debate, and a committee decision cannot override the House. As I pointed out earlier, committees cannot go beyond the powers conferred upon them by the House, and in particular, the committee cannot override Standing Order 116(2).</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799623">The committee's decision to support the chair's decision to adjourn the meeting outside of a duly called committee meeting without the consent of committee members was, in my view, an attempt to indirectly circumvent the relatively new rule found in subsection 2 of Standing Order 116. Standing Order 116(2) states:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799624">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">(a) Unless a time limit has been adopted by the committee or by the House, the Chair of a standing, special or legislative committee may not bring a debate to an end while there are members present who still wish to participate.

              <ParaText id="5799626">The committee brought the debate to an end while the member for <Affiliation DbId="214409" Type="2">Brandon—Souris</Affiliation> still had the floor and wanted to continue his remarks, a clear violation of Standing Order 116(2).</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799627">In addition, I would also argue that the Chair did not have the right to unilaterally adjourn Monday's meeting outside of a duly called committee meeting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799628">To first prove this point, I would draw your attention, Mr. Speaker, to rules pertaining to quorum. With respect to quorum, the rules governing the House are covered in chapter 9 in Bosc and Gagnon. At page 401, it states:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799629">

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">However, should the House adjourn for lack of quorum, any Order of the Day under consideration at the time, with the exception of non-votable items of Private Members’ Business, retains its precedence on the <I>Order Paper</I> for the next sitting. The lack of quorum means only that the House adjourns for the day.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799632">I would also argue that the chair of the standing committee went beyond his authority and breached the rules laid down by the House on a number of fronts, specifically the rules respecting the role of the chair and the business before the committee in the absence of quorum and the attempt to circumvent Standing Order 116(2)(a). </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799633">While the chair of the committee has implied consent to adjourn a meeting and if there is a loss of quorum during the sitting of a meeting, then a meeting can be adjourned. However, if a chair suspends a meeting, then the meeting must reconvene to then adjourn. The chair should not and cannot adjourn a meeting that he has suspended on his own. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799634">When committee members questioned him about this on Wednesday, he attempted to quote precedent to justify his decision. However, he falsely quoted precedent. The instance he cited was an instance in which a committee was adjourned through all-party agreement between whips and House leaders on the last day of a sitting that was then prorogued and therefore was in no way congruent to the situation currently at hand. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799635">In conclusion, the chair had no right to adjourn a meeting that had never started without the consent of the members, and he had no right to effectively terminate debate on a motion when there were members wishing to participate in said debate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799636">Should this decision of the chair be allowed to stand, it could have very serious consequences on the future democratic nature of committees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799637"> I ask, Mr. Speaker, that you nullify all business of the committee that was conducted after the suspension of said meeting and allow the member for <Affiliation DbId="214409" Type="2">Brandon—Souris</Affiliation> to continue debating the motion where he left off.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799639">The decisions that I took were very much done in consultation with the clerk of the committee and very much done with reference to the Standing Orders, some of which were referred to by the previous speaker and some of which were not. It was done very much in conversation with the table officers, who helped us through this decision. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I welcome your ruling on this when it is appropriate for you to do so, and that will help our committee to continue its work, which it has always meant to do in good faith.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799640">It can be assumed that when our committee lost quorum, we would obviously have wanted to continue, but the suspension of the meeting was based on a precedent from 2013 and deemed adjourned, so our meeting could go on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799641">The committee was advised at the subsequent meeting that they could resume that debate based on a motion to change the agenda for that committee, and that would have been a non-debatable motion; however, it was not moved. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799644">What I observed to transpire at that meeting was that the Liberal members of the committee went down to the committee meeting, and it appeared to me that they were advised to leave the room so that quorum could not be obtained. I would ask you to look into this in great detail, because I would refute my colleague's assertion that this was done in good faith. I also would refute the assertion that the government members on the committee have the intent to proceed in an orderly fashion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799645">The motion that was before the committee on which the government did proceed in this manner and subsequently adjourned the meeting was a motion to study the family reunification of the Yazidi victims of genocide. There were members of the community in the room, and they have observed this. I think that it is very important that we look at all the facts that occurred in this meeting, because, to me, it sets some very dangerous precedent in the ability of a chair to unilaterally end debate on a motion that the government members may or may not like. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799654"> It is very important that at all times we build trust not only for those who suffer from mental illness and mental injury, but fort hose who suffer from sexual assault as well so they know they will be believed and they can get the services they require. It is very important we build that environment of trust so they feel they can come forward and there will not be that stigma attached to them. Throughout this debate, we have heard that this still remains, because Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> does not address that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799655">My hon. colleague talked about his Bill <Document DbId="10278439" Type="4">C-426</Document>, which could address the removal of section 98(c). Again, it is a simple thing. I do not accept the argument that we need to study it. The wheels of bureaucracy move slowly. We tend to study things to death and then we are victims of our own inaction. We refuse to act when simple things could be done that would have such a major impact. Section 98(c) is one that my hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="214380" Type="2">Selkirk—Interlake—Eastman</Affiliation> mentioned it as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799656">This is not my file, but I read some of the amendments put forward by the my colleagues in the official opposition, and this was brought up by a number of colleagues. I did not know that in military law there is no provision for reporting the proceedings of a summary hearing. There is also no provision compelling an officer presiding over a summary hearing to give reasons for his or her findings. I had no knowledge that no notes were taken or recordings of proceedings. I am shocked that there would be not requirements in military legal procedure to take copious notes. That makes it very difficult for the appeal process.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799661">Going back to my earlier comment about subsection 98(c), I note there are simple things we can do as leaders and elected officials within the House. The 338 members of Parliament have been elected to be the voice of Canadians. There are simple things we could do to make the lives of Canadians better.

              <ParaText id="5799685">Madam Speaker, if my partisan colleague across the way had just given me another 10 seconds, that is where my next paragraph was going. The issue of carrying the course of justice is, in fact, not out of place within the context of the debate here today on Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document>, so there is relevancy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799686">Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> is all about carrying out the course of justice within our military in a way that protects victims. The legislation would bring forward changes to our military justice system that would give some protection to victims. That is something the Conservative government was working on, and as we heard earlier today from my colleague for <Affiliation DbId="214240" Type="2">Cariboo—Prince George</Affiliation>, the bill is almost a duplicate of what we had proposed in the last Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799687">As I said, the legislation would bring forward changes to our military justice system that would give some protection to victims, which is vitally important. Our previous government recognized this. It is why we brought in the Canadian Victims Bill of Rights and worked to enshrine those rights within our military justice system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799688">Former Bill <Document DbId="8045337" Type="3">C-71</Document>, which did not pass before the last election, looked very much like the legislation before us today. Our proposed legislation would have given victims the following: first, enhanced access to information through the appointment of a victim liaison officer; second, enhanced protection through new safety, security and privacy provisions; third, enhanced participation through impact statements at sentencing; and four, enhanced restitution, meaning a court martial would be required to consider making a restitution order for losses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799689">Imitation is the greatest form of flattery and that is on full display here. The Liberal government knows that what the Conservative government tried to do in the previous Parliament was the right thing to do, and that is why it is copying it with this legislation. However, there are a few differences that I would like to highlight. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799690">Perhaps the most glaring difference between the two bills would be the addition of the Gladue decision, in relation to paragraph 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code of Canada, into the National Defence Act. This addition would mean aboriginal members of the Canadian Armed Forces who face charges under the National Defence Act may face lighter punishment if convicted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799691">There is absolutely no place in the Canadian Armed Forces and in Canadian society, for that matter, for discrimination of any kind. No one should ever be discriminated against based upon race, gender, religion, culture or any other factor. That being said, the insertion of this principle has the potential to result in different consideration of offences committed by aboriginal forces members than for those committed by non-aboriginal forces members. This could lead to sentences that are less harsh, could undermine operational discipline and morale in the forces and could even undermine anti-racism policies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799692">I truly believe, and I think all of us in this place do, that judicial systems, military or otherwise, operate most effectively when the defining principle is equality before the law. By definition, equality applies to all. If we want true equality before the law, we cannot have separate levels of standards or sentences for some segments of the population. It must be applied uniformly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799693">Furthermore, while I am pleased the government is moving forward with legislation to help the men and women who are currently serving our country, it must be reminded that our veterans need our support as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799694">A recent report from the Parliamentary Budget Officer confirmed our veterans are paying for the mistakes of the government. The PBO's report, titled “The cost differential between three regimes of Veterans Benefits”, is clear proof that the pensions for life scheme by the government is falling well short of the mark when it comes to supporting the men and women who have served our country. The report confirms veterans with severe and permanent injuries will be worse off by an average of $300,000 under this scheme. This is unacceptable and needs to be addressed. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="45">(1545)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5799695">That said, it is my hope that Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> moves on to consideration in the Senate and that those in the other place will conduct a fulsome review of the bill to ensure that military justice reform works for all those who serve our country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799696">We cannot ever do enough for our veterans. A lot of veterans from the Second World War and many from the Korean War have left us and there will be more as time moves on. It is times like this, in their later years, when they need veterans services more than ever. I remind the government to change its attitude, change its ways and change Veterans Affairs so that the main goal is to serve these veterans instead of keeping the strings on the bank book unreasonably. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799712">My thanks for the opportunity to outline some of the many ways the Canadian Forces would strengthen the administration of military justice through Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799713">“Strong, Secure, Engaged”, our new defence policy, unveiled in July of 2017, marks our first step in the priorities of everything we do in the Canadian Forces, now and for years to come. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799714">We have a concrete vision, informed by diligent consultation with our fellow citizens from coast to coast to coast. The commitments we have made to our women and men in uniform will provide them with a more dynamic, prosperous and resolutely positive work environment that guarantees respect for the individual rights of all. The changes introduced in Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document>, coupled with the steps taken to respond to the Auditor General's report, will make it even stronger.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799715"> I want to start by reminding the House that Canada maintains a unique system of military justice. The Code of Service Discipline mandates that the military justice system deal expeditiously and fairly with service offences while respecting the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. That said, there are some fundamental differences between the two systems, and for very good reason. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799716">The military justice system is vital to maintaining discipline, efficiency and morale in the Canadian Armed Forces. That is crucial, given the unique environment in which it operates. Military personnel often risk injury, or even death, as they perform their duties in Canada and abroad. Discipline and cohesion within military units can literally be a matter of life and death. Equally important, the military justice system enables Canada to comply with its obligation under international law to hold its military personnel accountable for their conduct during naval, land and air operations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799717">The military justice system is continually evolving to comply with Canadian law and Canadian values, and we will ensure that it remains responsive to both the accused and the victims. We are proud to continue in this direction and to promote the progress of justice in Canada and within our forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799718"> This legislation would ensure that the military justice system could satisfy both the expectations of Canadians and the unique needs of the Canadian Armed Forces. In addition, the legislation would improve victim support through information, protection, participation and restitution rights. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799719">The bill would also introduce indigenous sentencing considerations to mirror similar provisions within the civilian criminal justice system, and it would provide sentencing and sanctions provisions for service offences and service infractions rooted in bias, prejudice or hate toward individuals based on their gender expression or identity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799720">Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> would also complement the positive actions resulting from the recommendations of the Auditor General's office on ways to strengthen the administration of military justice. The judge advocate general had already initiated a number of measures to improve the administration of the system prior to that report, and the department is implementing an action plan to ensure that all nine recommendations are addressed.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5799721">The Office of the Judge Advocate General and the director of military prosecutions have implemented or amended various policies to address the Auditor General's recommendations. For instance, the Office of the Judge Advocate General has begun to develop a new electronic case management tool and database to capture the relevant data on all military justice cases. This case management system directly responds to several recommendations to identify and address delays in military justice system processes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799722">However, our goal is not simply to speed up the system. We want to make sure that the system continues working, and working well. The case management system will assist the Canadian Armed Forces in maintaining the discipline, efficiency and morale of Canadian Armed Forces members as they work in the service of Canada, both at home and abroad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799723">The judge advocate general has also re-established the military justice round table to increase and improve communications among key actors in the military justice system. The round table brings together key stakeholders from across the military justice system to discuss best practices in its administration. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799724">As “Strong, Secure, Engaged” makes clear, we are ensuring the long-term health and wellness of military members and civilian personnel. Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> is one of the many ways we are delivering on that pledge. That pledge also means that we work together to build a more inclusive and respectful environment in our military.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799725">This is an important achievement for all our members in the military, and we hope to have the support of all parties to pass the bill. Our military justice system is vital to maintaining discipline, efficiency and morale in the military. This carefully balanced legislation would ensure that the Canadian Armed Forces could do exactly that. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799735">Madam Speaker, I stand here today as the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="214123" Type="2">Fredericton</Affiliation>. I am proud that over the last three-and-a-half years I have had the distinct privilege to meet with many of the women and men of the Canadian Armed Forces who serve at 5th Canadian Division Support Base Gagetown.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799736">Centred in the town of Oromocto, Base Gagetown is the second-largest military base in Canada and the home of Canada's army. Gagetown is not just a place of work for the 7,500 military members and civilian personnel, it is home to countless families. It is a school. It is a medical centre.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799737">Base Gagetown is an economic driver for New Brunswick. It is the second-largest public sector employer in the province and the third-largest employer overall. It contributes hundreds of millions of dollars to our local and provincial economy each year. The benefits the base brings to our community are far too many to count.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799738">Canadian Armed Forces members at Base Gagetown do not only make Fredericton, New Maryland, Oromocto and the Grand Lake region a more vibrant place to live, as members of the military, they put their lives on the line for our country and give up their own safety to defend ours.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799739">We can never match that honour and sacrifice, but what we can do is ensure that the structures within the military are as strong as they can be so Canadian Armed Forces personnel and their families never have to see their own system as an obstacle to overcome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799740">Military members keep us safe, but we must protect them as well. By amending the National Defence Act, Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> is ensuring better protection for the women and men of the Canadian Armed Forces under the military justice system. Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> means a more just and equitable future for the 6,500 members of the Canadian Armed Forces at Base Gagetown and for thousands more who serve across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799741">The very nature of the military means its justice system must consider a different set of demands, from the hazards of war to the hierarchal chain of command. The Canadian Armed Forces must always be able to enforce discipline within that chain of command, so it can be ready and able to respond to any threat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799742">Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> commits to strengthening the victims rights within the unique framework of the military justice system. From ensuring that victims of inappropriate conduct by members of the Canadian Armed Forces have the right to information, protection, participation and restitution to establishing a new victim liaison officer to help guide victims through the military justice system, we are ensuring that the victims rights are not only respected but that they are strengthened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799743">When victims come forward with a complaint, we must ensure they are fully supported. Anything less is unacceptable. Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> is about making real changes in the lives of our service members. The impact of those changes will be felt across the country, from the Military Family Resource Centre and the Royal Canadian Legion in Oromocto all the way to Alert to Esquimalt to St. John's.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799744">Victims rights matter, and that is why these changes matter as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799745">As the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> has made clear, the Canadian Armed Forces welcomes the Auditor General's recommendations on ways to strengthen the administration of military justice. Our government is committed to maintaining a fair, modern and robust military justice system. We thank the Auditor General for this important work and accept the recommendations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799746">Unfortunately this review reflects the previous government's neglect of not only the military, but also the military justice system, which is an important part of military discipline and morale within the Canadian Armed Forces. Unlike the previous government, we are committed to ensuring the efficiency of the military justice system. Unlike the previous government, which allowed delays to fester, we are committed to ensuring a reliable military justice system.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5799747">We have already started to address some of the Auditor General's recommendations, including a case management system to monitor and manage cases as they progress through the system, extending the postings of defence counsel and military prosecutors to better serve both the accused and the Crown and reinstating the military justice round table, which the previous government abolished. These are just some of the measures we have taken to address the report and we will continue to work to ensure an effective military justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799748">To get back to the matter at hand, the Auditor General's findings reinforce that the judge advocate general of the Canadian Armed Forces, or JAG, is taking the right approach to modernizing the system. The JAG, Commodore Geneviève Bernatchez, oversees the administration of military justice in the forces. She has embraced the Auditor General's recommendations, which will guide her efforts to ensure the military justice system meets the expectations of Canadians and the needs of the Canadian Armed Forces. She has already developed a detailed action plan to respond to all nine recommendations, and members of the military are already seeing improvements to the administration of the military justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799749">Many important changes are already under way, with the office of the JAG and the director of military prosecutions actively implementing measures to improve how military justice is administered. For instance, even before the Auditor General made his recommendations, the office of the JAG began to develop a new electronic case management tool and database to capture the relevant data on all military justice cases. This will directly respond to a number of the Auditor General's recommendations to identify and address delays in military justice processes and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799750"> The justice, administration and information management system, JAIMS, will allow for the real-time tracking of files as they proceed through the system. It will incorporate and enable the enforcement of time standards that will be established following a review conducted by the JAG as part of the response from the Department of National Defence to the Auditor General's recommendations. JAIMS will allow military justice stakeholders and decision-makers to access case data in real time and be prompted when their action is required. This will help reduce delays by improving how the military justice system's files are managed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799751">This is not simply about speeding up the system. We want to ensure the system is working and working well. As members may have heard my colleagues say, the military justice system is vital to the ability of the Canadian Armed Forces to achieve its missions in Canada and around the world. It cannot and will not remain static. The military justice system, like the civilian criminal justice system, is constantly evolving to remain fully compliant with Canadian law, norms and values. That is why our government tabled Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document>, which proposes to introduce a declaration of victims rights to incorporate indigenous sentencing considerations and reform summary trials.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799752"> In Canada's defence policy, “Strong, Secure, Engaged”, our government has made an unprecedented commitment to provide the men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces with the support they need and deserve. That includes the assurance that military members will continue to have access to a fair and effective military justice system as they bravely serve Canadians at home and abroad. With Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> and the many progressive changes being instituted by the Office of the Judge Advocate General, we are clearly delivering on this pledge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799753"> The Auditor General's report offers valuable insights and tangible recommendations that will help us further enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the military justice system. The changes the Auditor General has urged, many of which we are already acting on, will ensure the military justice system remains valuable and relevant in contributing to the operational readiness of the Canadian Armed Forces.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799771">It is a pleasure to rise in the House today to discuss an issue of great importance to members of the Canadian Armed Forces, their loved ones and all those who support both victims of crime and our Canadian Armed Forces. As a member of Parliament from northeast Edmonton, I have the great pleasure of representing many members of the Canadian Armed Forces who live off base while deployed at Edmonton Garrison.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799772">When I meet with these men and women, their conviction, dedication and love for our country never ceases to amaze me. I am very pleased to be able to lend my voice to them this afternoon as we continue to discuss Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document>, an act to amend the National Defence Act and to make related and consequential amendments to other acts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799773">In the last Parliament, the former Conservative government worked hard to develop and entrench the Canadian Victims Bill of Rights in law. It was a very proud day when the legislation was enacted, as it rebalanced our justice system to put more of an emphasis on protecting and empowering victims and standing up for their rights during criminal proceedings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799774">Over the years, there was an emphasis on ensuring accused people were treated properly, and everyone here understands how important that is as well. However, Canada's Conservatives believe victims rights need to be at the heart of our justice system. We understand victims deserve the right to information, protection, participation and, where possible, restitution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799775">Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> is an important piece of legislation. It continues the good work of our former Conservative government of enshrining the rights of victims of a crime in law, this time for our military justice system. The bill is largely based on legislation our former government put forward, which was Bill <Document DbId="8045337" Type="3">C-71</Document> from the last Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799776">Bill <Document DbId="8045337" Type="3">C-71</Document> was introduced to ensure victims going through the military justice system had many of the same protections provided to civilians by the Canadian Victims Bill of Rights. I am very pleased the Liberal government did the right thing and used our previous legislation as the basis for Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> .</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799777">Canada has a long history of having a parallel justice system for our military. There are those who rail against this idea and believe military justice issues should be handled in civilian courts. Perhaps they do not understand why we have two systems, or maybe they do and simply disagree. Having these parallel systems has been upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada a number of times, and is even protected in the charter under section 11.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799778">The sad reality is that we often must ask much of the members of the Canadian Armed Forces. We ask them to risk life, limb and mental health for the protection of our great country and the promotion of freedom, democracy and the rule of law, often in far off and hostile environments. This operational reality of the military means Canadian Armed Forces members must be held to a higher standard than what would be expected of a civilian.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799779">This reality is recognized in the Supreme Court's 1992 ruling of R. v. Généreux, which acknowledges the armed forces must be able to deal with discipline issues quickly, effectively and efficiently for the sake of the operational readiness of our armed forces so that they may defend against threats to Canada's security. For this important reason, the armed forces has its own code of service discipline, as well as military justice tribunals to enforce it and ensure the military can accommodate its particular disciplinary needs.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5799780">That decision is from 1992. However, it has been upheld a number of times since then, most recently in 2015. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799781">While out of necessity there is an imperative for the armed forces to be able to administer justice in its unique way, there is no reason why victims rights should not be also featured prominently in the military justice system. I believe that Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> is a good step forward in accomplishing this goal while building on the established code of service and Operation Honour to effectively combat sexual misconduct, harassment and deal with issues of intolerance in the Canadian Armed Forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799782">While this is good legislation, which I am looking forward to supporting once again, I would be remiss if I did not take this opportunity to highlight some concerns I have with the bill as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799783">Under the military justice system currently, charges can be dealt with through a summary trial or a court martial. Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> introduces a new category of service infractions consisting of minor infractions that can be dealt with through a new method of summary hearings, replacing summary trials. In proposed subsections 163.1(1), (2) and (3), Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> shifts the burden of proof. In a summary hearing it goes from “beyond a reasonable doubt” to “on a balance of probabilities”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799784"> Currently, proof must be beyond a reasonable doubt, the same as in the civilian legal systems. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is one of the pillars of the Canadian justice system, and I believe that it should remain the case for our military justice system, particularly when we consider that through a summary hearing, a service member's commanding officer is able to confine them to barracks or ship for up to 21 days. In light of that realization, I believe the burden of proof should remain higher than “on a balance of probabilities”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799785">Unfortunately, our colleague for <Affiliation DbId="214380" Type="2">Selkirk—Interlake—Eastman</Affiliation>'s amendment to make this sensible change was voted down at committee, though I hope it will receive further consideration at the other place. Failing that, I hope this will be able to be reconciled through regulation to both avoid a charter challenge and ensure that the men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces can be treated justly if they find themselves being called to a summary hearing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799786"> The last issue I want to briefly touch on is the issue initially raised by our NDP colleague for <Affiliation DbId="213909" Type="2">Esquimalt—Saanich—Sooke</Affiliation> that Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> does not repeal parts of paragraph 98(c) of the National Defence Act, which lists self-harm as an offence that can result in a fine and/or imprisonment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799787"> I take heart in the fact that the committee heard that this is rarely used and it is my understanding that the intention is to provide recourse against individuals who may maim or injure themselves in order to be excused from duty or to be discharged. I do appreciate that rationale, but we also cannot overlook that we ask members of the Canadian Armed Forces to do and bear witness to extraordinary things and that, as a result, not only their bodies can be damaged and scarred but their minds as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799788"> I do not believe anyone with the privilege to sit in this chamber supports prosecuting people who make a desperate act like self-harm because they are suffering from a mental health issue. Even if it is rarely used, I do not think it should even be an option. It is my understanding that when this issue came up in relation to Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document>, it was ruled out of scope of the legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799789">With that in mind I would like to echo our colleague for <Affiliation DbId="214380" Type="2">Selkirk—Interlake—Eastman</Affiliation> in calling for the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> to take this issue and come back to the House with a separate piece of legislation to address this oversight at the earliest opportunity.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799802">Madam Speaker, it is an honour to speak to this bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799803">In talking about military justice reform and justice reform, I want to thank the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation>. The difference between a justice system and the potential for injustice, integrity versus undue pressure, and of course, rule of law versus political manipulation is certainly an issue that many of us were seized with last night as we heard the testimony. Hopefully there will be an opportunity for everyone to get to the bottom of that, because Canadians are extremely concerned about that type of action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799804">I want to talk specifically about the military, keeping in mind that for those in the military, there are certain rules and responsibilities they have to deal with. Mistakes made can well result in death, whether it is operational or in training. These are very important issues and why there has to be a system of rules and laws that make sure that everyone follows the same set of rules. That is critical.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799805">Some of the discussion here today has included the mental health aspect, PTSD and making sure that there is help along those lines. That is extremely important. I come from an area where I know many military members and their families in the community. I listen and find out what their stories are. It is not the things veterans tell me; it is the things those engaged in the field now have to say. It is very important that we keep that in mind and respect it, because that is what is involved with the different laws we are talking about today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799806">The intention of the bill is to make changes to Canada's military justice system, and it does it in a number of ways. As was mentioned by one of the members opposite, it would enshrine victims rights in the National Defence Act, which is certainly important. It would also put a statute of limitations of six months on summary trial cases and clarify what cases would be handled by summary trial. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799807">Victims rights would include enhanced access to information through the appointment of a victims liaison officer; enhanced protection through new safety, security and privacy provisions; enhanced participation through impact statements at sentencing and enhanced restitution. A court martial would require considering making a restitution order for the losses someone might have endured. Those issues are certainly critical.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799808">In the discussions, a number of amendments were introduced, some of which were accepted and some of which were not. I know from many committees that this is a normal situation. The first was civilian criminal records for uniquely military offences. The issue was that if a soldier were found guilty and sentenced, it would result in a criminal record in the civilian world. The committee looked at five uniquely military offences that would be considered minor offences: insubordinate behaviour, quarrels and disturbances, absence without leave, drunkenness and conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline. The committee tried to fit those activities into what the general public would have. Consequential amendments were made to ensure that a soldier convicted one of those minor offences would not be given a civilian criminal record, no matter what the severity of the sentence would be if served in the military. The legislative counsel flagged that and said that it was outside the scope of Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document>. Nevertheless, it is perhaps something that could be addressed later.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5799809">The other issue was burden of proof. When we considered what we had in Bill<Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document>, the burden of proof was shifted from beyond a reasonable doubt to a “balance of probabilities”. The burden of proof does not provide the same level of protection for service members undergoing a summary hearing. As a result, there is a concern. The change to “balance of probabilities” from beyond a reasonable doubt is certainly something everyone should be aware of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799810">One of the other amendments was on recording of proceedings and reasons for findings. This is just making sure that the information would be available for the accused and for others associated with the trial.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799811">Appeals was another issue. Certain punishments resulting from the summary hearings could be penal in nature. However, there was no avenue to an appeal this to a higher or different authority. The amendment would allow an appeal to a judge at the Court Martial Appeal Court in the case of sentencing arising from a summary hearing that was penal in nature.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799812">The issue of rank was a concern because of the way the military is set up. In some cases, a non-commissioned member could be one rank below an officer and making decisions. It was important that this language be dealt with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799813">Those are some of the key things that were involved in the discussion. It made me feel good that under those circumstances, there was certainly ample time taken to deal with those items that are unique to the system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799814">As has been mentioned many times, Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> is similar to the legislation we presented a few years ago. It is important that we continue to look at and flag some of the important things that were done by our Conservative government and recognize the system that is in place right now and the problems we see in this country. Perhaps it will not be too long before we will be able to have a Conservative government back and doing something that will be good for everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799815">The purpose of Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> is to align the military justice system with the Criminal Code of Canada. Enshrining a victims bill of rights in the National Defence Act, putting a statute of limitations on summary hearing cases and clarifying what cases should be handled by a summary hearing are significant points.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799816">The legislation before us today would enact in the Code of Service Discipline a declaration of victims rights. It would give victims the right to information, protection, participation and restitution. These rights mirror those in our previous government's Canadian Victims Bill of Rights, which received royal assent on April 23, 2015.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799817">When we consider the severe offences that have diverse victims, including military members and their families and members of the broader civilian community, to many of these individuals the military justice system can be unfamiliar and potentially intimidating. Therefore, to help ensure that victims were properly informed and positioned to access their rights, the legislation would provide for the appointment of a victims' liaison officer when a victim required this appointment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799818">The bill would ensure that victims of service offences within the military justice system would be able to exercise their rights, as detailed in the proposed legislation, such as the right to protection and participation. The legislation also proposes complementary changes to many court martial processes. For example, the proposed legislation would enhance a victim's ability to participate in court martial proceedings by broadening the way victim impact statements could be presented at the court martial.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799819">There are many similarities between the legislation before us today and the legislation our Conservative government introduced. It has enough worthwhile similarities to our government's legislation that it deserves the support of the House at this point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799820">My Conservative colleagues and I are committed to standing up for victims of crime and ensuring that victims have a more efficient and effective voice in the criminal justice system.</ParaText>

Whether it be in the military or in the general public, we need to make sure that we recognize the damage done when criminal activities affect an individual. Therefore, it was important that we set up a structure for the general public, but it is also important to bring that into the military justice system as well. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799823">Madam Speaker, one of the issues that comes up time and again is the very serious issue of PTSD and other mental health issues in our military. Certain elements can be best addressed through budgetary measures. One of the things we have seen over the last couple of years is a sincere commitment to centres of excellence to deal with mental illness, which we think is a good thing. We have seen an increase in the number of health care workers. I believe it is now at around 200. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799824">The Conservative Party has been very supportive of the legislation. Even the NDP supports the legislation. We also need to look at other ways we can support our women and men in the Canadian Forces, and that includes investing in health care. I wonder if my colleague could provide his thoughts on that. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799826">It is important, because often there is not the same type of skill set for those dealing with PTSD in the general public and in the military. With the types of things they see, whether operationally or even in training, they know that they are the ones responsible for some of the carnage there. Therefore, it is very important for them to have people who understand their circumstances. To have professionals who are directly related to the military when it comes to PTSD is certainly an important aspect. Hopefully, we will always be able to maintain that as one of the critical components of any type of military justice system and support for our military. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799827">Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to join colleagues here today for the third reading debate of Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document>, an act to amend the National Defence Act and to make related and consequential amendments to other acts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799828">I must say that it is my profound honour to represent the city of Halifax in this place. The riding of Halifax includes the home of Canada's east coast navy and the Maritime Atlantic Command, or MARLANT. It includes elements of the 5th Canadian Division, the great Mighty Maroon Machine. It includes elements of the 12 Wing Shearwater air force base and, of course, all of their families. All these servicemen and women call Halifax home. Over these years, I have developed many lasting friendships as I meet them on base or on ship and as they meet me in their member of Parliament's office. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799829">I am so pleased that this bill is before us. With it, our government is going to be strengthening victims' rights within the military justice system. With Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document>, we would also enshrine a declaration of victims' rights in the code of service discipline within the National Defence Act. We would also ensure victims' rights are respected and, notably, that we are providing victims the right to a victims liaison officer, who will help victims navigate the often confusing justice system. The bill would also enhance the speed and fairness of the summary trial system to address minor breaches of military discipline. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799830">I am very proud to be in this House today to contribute to our government's efforts to have the military justice system continuously evolve to comply with Canadian laws and values, and we will ensure it remains responsive to both accused and victims. Reforms are building on Canada's military justice system in the long, proud history that it has of helping to maintain a high level of discipline, efficiency and morale within the Canadian Armed Forces, and it is in that spirit that our government has committed to reviewing, modernizing and improving our civilian and military systems of justice. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799831">I am happy to reiterate what many of my colleagues around the House have said today: While some of the changes we are proposing to the National Defence Act are minor and some are considerably more significant, at their core each strives to make sure that the military justice system remains relevant and legitimate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799832">The Supreme Court of Canada has affirmed on multiple occasions that the military needs a military justice system. Our military justice system contributes to the maintenance of discipline, efficiency and morale in the Canadian Armed Forces, but what is more, the military justice system is needed to deal with cases of breaches to military discipline that have no equivalent and no raison d'être in Canada's civilian criminal justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799833">I will now offer a broad overview of the changes that we are proposing through Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799834">To start, the amendments will clearly enshrine victims' rights in the military justice system and make sure adequate support is put in place to support them by adopting a more victim-centred approach in the military justice system. To do that, Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> proposes to add a declaration of victims rights within the code of service discipline. This declaration will ensure that the victims of service offences are informed, protected and heard throughout the military justice process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799835">The declaration provides victims of service offences with four new rights. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799836">The first is the right to information, so that victims understand the process that they are a part of, how the case is proceeding, which services and programs are available to them and how to file a complaint if they believe their rights under the declaration have been denied or infringed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799837">The nature of the military justice system is unique, and understanding it can be difficult and even sometimes intimidating. For those reasons, this legislation includes the appointment of the victims liaison officer to help guide victims through the process and inform them of how the system works. Under the victims' right to information, they would also have access to information about the investigation, prosecution and sentencing of the person who has harmed them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799838">The second core right in the legislation is that of protection, so that victims' privacy and security are considered at all stages of the military justice system. Moreover, where it is appropriate, it will ensure that their identity is protected. It also ensures that reasonable and necessary measures are taken to protect victims from intimidation or retaliation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799839">The third right is for participation, so that victims can express their views about the decisions to be made by military justice authorities and have those views considered. This right also includes the right to present a victim impact statement at a court martial so that the harm they have suffered can be fully appreciated at sentencing. In addition, it will be possible to submit military and community impact statements to the court martial. These will convey the full extent of the harm caused to the Canadian Armed Forces or the community as a result of the offence.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5799840">The fourth right is to restitution, so that the court martial may consider making a restitution order for all offences when financial losses and damages could be reasonably determined.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799841">The next notable change introduced by this legislation relates to how indigenous offenders are sentenced. This is also a change that stems from the evolution of Canada's civilian criminal justice system and our desire to ensure that the military justice system reflects our times while remaining faithful to its mandate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799842">In the case of the military justice system, the changes introduced by Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> will make the system faster and simpler. The summary hearing will be introduced and will address minor breaches of military discipline in a non-penal and non-criminal manner. This new system will be more agile, timely and responsive. More serious matters will be directed to courts martial, and there will no longer be a summary trial.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799843">The summary hearing will only deal with a new category of minor breach of military discipline termed a service infraction. All service offences that are more major in nature will be dealt with at a court martial. There will be no criminal consequences for service infractions, and military commanders who conduct summary hearings will be limited to non-penal sanctions to address them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799844">This approach has the added benefit of improving the chain of command's ability to address minor breaches of military discipline fairly and more rapidly. We expect that this will enhance the responsiveness and efficiency of military discipline, thereby contributing to the operational effectiveness of the Canadian Armed Forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799845">In 2017, our government launched Canada's defence policy, “strong, secure, engaged”. It is a policy that charts a course for the defence of Canada for the next 20 years. It puts our people first and at the heart of what we do. It spells out clearly how the government will support the Canadian Armed Forces as an organization and support its women and men in uniform as our most important asset. On the whole, that policy is a commitment to take concrete steps to give service members what they need to continue excelling in their work, as they always have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799846">The military justice system is central to how the Canadian Armed Forces accomplishes what it does every single day. It sets up the framework for service members to maintain an outstanding level of discipline and a high level of morale so that they can successfully accomplish the difficult tasks we ask of them. Knowing that they are protected by a military justice system that keeps pace with Canadian values and concepts of justice builds great unit cohesion among our forces as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799847"> It is a pleasure to see this legislation progress to second reading, as we continue to make every effort to deliver for the women and men of our armed forces and for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799848">The drive to be fair, to be just, and to restore that which has been harmed is a drive that dates back to the very foundations of our country and our armed forces. Today we are taking steps in the pursuit of justice, steps to take care of victims while we seek to ensure justice is served, steps to ensure that indigenous peoples in the military justice system receive the same considerations when sentenced as those in the civilian justice system and steps to uphold justice within our military so that they can continue defending this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799849">I thank every member in this House who will be supporting this very important bill and working with us toward that very worthy goal for the servicemen and women in Halifax, across Canada and indeed around the world. It is just the right thing to do.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799857">Madam Speaker, my colleague and friend represents a wonderful area of Canada where there is a very strong military presence. He has consistently been a very strong advocate for our women and men in the Canadian Armed Forces. As someone who served in the Canadian Armed Forces a number of years ago, I think one of the changes, and I mentioned this morning, is the difference between civilian life and military life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799858">If service members are absent without leave or even late, they subject themselves to a potential court martial, which would then give them a criminal record.

              <ParaText id="5799859">In part, this legislation tries to address that inequity and allow for more discretion so that when Canadian Armed Forces personnel retire and become veterans, fewer will find themselves with a criminal record because of something that happened while they were an active member. We do not want to see that, although we heard many examples at committee. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799862">As the member would have heard me say in my speech, part of what the bill would accomplish is to make sure that service members are treated in a fair and reasonable way relative to non-service members and in a way that they can understand, and that they can have an expectation of being treated fairly. This is fundamental to creating a service that draws people to choose to serve, to take on the possibility of the greatest possible sacrifice for this country that we can imagine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799863">One of the wonderful things in the bill to make that happen is the creation of the victim liaison officer to pick through what can be an intimidating or daunting process.

              <ParaText id="5799864">Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to rise in the House today. I would like to use my time to share how this government is supporting victims of inappropriate conduct by members of the Canadian Armed Forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799865">Last year, our government introduced legislation in the House that proposed to add a declaration of victims rights to the military's code of service discipline. This is good news. It shows that military justice in the country continues to evolve in the best interests of Canadians and the Canadian Armed Forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799866">When victims display courage by coming forward with a complaint, we must ensure they are supported fully. Anything less would be unacceptable. Every victim, whether a Canadian Armed Forces member or civilian, deserves to be treated with trust, dignity and respect. This legislation shows that the government recognizes the harmful impact of service offences on victims, the military and society. It reconfirms this government's commitment to strengthen victims rights in the military justice system. It is our view that the legislation advances Canada's position as a global leader in support for victims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799867">The proposed amendments in the bill will strengthen and uphold victims rights within the military justice system, while ensuring these rights mirror those in the Canadian Victims Bill of Rights. Simply put, the legislation creates and extends rights for victims in four specific areas: the right to information about how the military justice system works; the right to protection of security and privacy; the right to participation by expanding how victim impact statements can be presented at a court martial; and the right to restitution for damages or losses. These rights would be available to any victim of a service offence when he or she comes into contact with the military justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799868"> Let me expand more on each of the four rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799869">The first is the right to information. Any victims of a service offence have the right to general information about their own role and how Canada's military justice system works. They will be informed about the services and programs available to them. They will have the right to know how their case is progressing within the military justice system. This includes any information related to the status and outcome of investigations and the prosecution or sentencing of the person who harmed them. It is vital to keep victims informed during what can be a complex and foreign process. However, it is only the first step.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799870">Second, a victim's right to protection must be considered in any matter in which a service offence has been committed. That is why the bill extends victims the right to have their security and privacy considered at all stages in the military justice system. The legislation would give victims the right to have reasonable and necessary measures taken to protect them from intimidation and retaliation. Victims can also request that their identities be protected. This is paramount to ensuring that victims rights are protected when they come into contact with the military justice system through no fault of their own. It will protect vulnerable participants by giving military judges the power to order publication bans, the power to allow testimony outside of the courtroom and the power to prevent an accused person from cross-examining a victim in a court martial.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5799871">The third way this government is recognizing victims is by enhancing their right to participate in the military justice system. We are doing this by expanding how victim impact statements can be presented at court martial. We are also enabling victims to share at various stages of the legal process their views about decisions that affect their rights and to have those views considered by appropriate authorities. This will ensure that the views of victims and the harm and loss they have suffered can be fully considered by appropriate authorities in the military justice system. It will also allow for a community impact statement to be submitted, describing the harm, the loss and the overall impact of a service offence on the community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799872">In addition to victim and community impact statements, the bill would enable the submission of a military impact statement on behalf of the Canadian Armed Forces when one of its members commits a service offence. Such an impact statement could describe the harm done to the discipline, efficiency or morale within the unit or to the Canadian Armed Forces as a whole. The statement would be taken into account alongside victim and community impact statements. The victim's right to participate before courts martial is a crucial part of recognizing the losses, damages or wrongs he or she has suffered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799873">The fourth and final right for victims in the legislation concerns their right to restitution. This will ensure victims can ask a court martial to consider ordering restitution for damages or losses when that value can be readily determined.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799874">These rights will be guaranteed for any victims of a service offence committed by a service member should they come into contact with the military justice system. We are committed to ensuring victims are treated with dignity and respect and we are taking this responsibility seriously. We owe it to victims and to their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799875"> I have a number of families in my riding serve. I have the Kingston armed forces base on one side and the Trenton air base on the other side of my riding, so I have a number of serving members and veterans who live within my riding. I have worked closely with the MFRC in Trenton, which provides incredible services to members of the Trenton air base. The Military Family Resource Centre is a valuable resource that provides a number of different types of services to military service personnel. This is another reason why I am so pleased to make this speech today. This is so important to the families, the service personnel and the many thousands of civilians who work in the military at these two bases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799876">By maintaining discipline, efficiency and morale, the military justice system helps the Canadian Armed Forces achieve its mission here at home and around the world. Adopting the declaration of victims rights in the Code of Service Discipline will strengthen the rights of victims within the military justice system. It will ensure that victims have the right to information, protection, participation and restitution when they have been wronged. It will reinforce Canada's position as a global leader in maintaining a fair and effective military justice system, one that evolves in harmony with our civilian laws.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799877"> For all these reasons, members on this side of the House will be supporting the bill. I am so proud to be part of a government that has brought forward a bill that will make such a difference in the lives of military service members and their families.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799880">Our government is committed to strengthening the rights of victims in the military justice system. In addition to ensuring respect for victims rights, Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> includes a provision to incorporate aboriginal sentencing into the military justice system and more severely sanction military misconduct and misconduct related to prejudices against members of the LGBTQ2 community. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5799881">Madam Speaker, I am happy to rise in the House today to discuss Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> and the important changes to the National Defence Act that our government is proposing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799882">Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> proposes changes to the act that we feel modernize it and are long overdue. At the heart of these changes are our people and those in service to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799883">This is the most important piece, as I see it. I come from a family of people who have had long-term service in the Canadian military. I am extremely proud not just of them and the work they have done but of all those who serve in the Canadian Armed Forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799884">My sister is now a veteran of the military and continues to work with the Department of National Defence. I also have three other family members in service for this country. I have come to understand the tremendous sacrifices they and their families have made for our country each and every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799885">We owe all the women and men in the Canadian Armed Forces a lot. We owe them our deep gratitude for their service to our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799886">We also owe them fairness, openness and transparency within that service. This includes a military justice system that ensures that victims receive the support they need and deserve, a system that promotes a culture of leadership, respect and honour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799887">Canadian Armed Forces members are held to a higher standard of conduct, as we all know. Whether they are stationed in Canada or deployed around the world, we ask a lot of them each and every day. We have a responsibility to ensure that the rules that guide their conduct are transparent, equitable and fair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799888">Much of what is within Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> is an extension of the work our government is already doing to ensure a more victim-centred approach to justice; to build on Bill <Document DbId="9220285" Type="3">C-65</Document>, our government's legislation against workplace harassment; to strengthen truth and reconciliation with indigenous people; and to change military culture, through Operation Honour, in order to ensure that the Canadian Armed Forces provides a respectful workplace of choice for every Canadian.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799889">I would like to take a moment to expand on the importance of Operation Honour. As many members in the room know, Operation Honour aims to eliminate sexual misconduct in the Canadian Armed Forces. We have zero tolerance for sexual misconduct of any kind in our Canadian Armed Forces and in any entity within the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799890">Through Operation Honour, we have introduced a new victim response centre that provides better training for the Canadian Armed Forces personnel and an easier reporting system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799891">I would also like to acknowledge the important work of the Sexual Misconduct Resource Centre, which recently released its annual report. We thank the centre for continuing to support Canadian Armed Forces members affected by sexual misconduct.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799892">I am also pleased to note that the SMRC is looking at providing caseworkers to victims of inappropriate sexual behaviour to ensure they have continuous support from when they first report an incident to when their case concludes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799893">The work of the Sexual Misconduct Resource Centre has been exceptional. I know that victims are being well supported as a result of its efforts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799894">Its origins come from former Supreme Court justice Marie Deschamps, who recommended it in her 2015 report. As a government, we acted to put in place a sexual misconduct response centre to provide support to those affected by inappropriate sexual behaviour.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5799895">We have extended the hours so that staff at the centre are there to listen and provide support to members of the Canadian Armed Forces calling in 24 hours a day, seven days a week, no matter where they are in the world. Last October's annual report of the centre demonstrates the important work that they have done and continue to do to enhance victim support for members of the Canadian Armed Forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799896">I would now like to turn to the legislation at hand and to highlight how Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> will give victims a voice and change our National Defence Act in four important ways. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799897">First, like the civilian criminal justice system, it will enshrine important rights for victims. Second, it will seek harsher penalties for crimes motivated by bias, prejudice or hate toward gender identity or expression. Third, it will ensure that the specific circumstances of indigenous offenders are taken into account in the sentencing process. Fourth, it will reform the manner in which the chain of command administers summary trials.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799898">Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> proposes the inclusion of a declaration of victims rights in the National Defence Act. The declaration mirrors the Canadian Victims Bill of Rights, which strengthens and guides how we support victims in the civilian criminal justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799899"> Specifically, the bill would legislate four new victim rights within the military justice system. They are the right to information, the right to protection, the right to participation and the right to restitution. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799900">In order to ensure that victims would be able to exercise these rights, they would be entitled to the support of a victim liaison officer, should they require it. These liaison officers will be able to explain how service offences are charged, dealt with and tried under the code of service discipline. They will help victims access information to which they are entitled, and they will remain available to assist the victim throughout their interaction with the military justice system. This would ensure that victims understand each stage of the process and how they can engage meaningfully throughout the process. The support that the victim liaison officer would offer will be comprehensive. It will be fair and it will always be offered in the spirit of preserving victims' dignity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799901">Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> also specifically addresses issues of gender-based prejudice and hatred in military service offences and infractions. The bill proposes harsher sentences and sanctions for service offences and infractions that are motivated by bias, prejudice or hate toward gender expression or identity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799902"> Our men and women in uniform, and those who work and live alongside them, must feel welcomed and respected at all times. The Canadian Armed Forces has zero tolerance for discrimination of any kind. This amendment will better align the military justice system with that principle. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799903">On that note, through programs such as the positive space initiative, the defence team has been working hard to help create inclusive work environments for everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression. I commend them for their work on this initiative, which provides training to ambassadors in support of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and two-spirited community members who work with us every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799904">The next change that I would like to focus on is how we propose to update the military justice system to better reflect the realities of historic injustices inflicted upon indigenous peoples. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799905">In the civilian criminal justice system, the Criminal Code mandates that judges must carefully consider circumstances during sentencing. Specifically, for all offenders they must consider all available sanctions. This principle is to be applied with particular attention to the circumstances of indigenous offenders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799906"> This particular bill is one that I am proud to support. As a member who represents a region with a military base and every day sees those who serve in uniform, I really believe that this legislation is helping to modernize and bring more transparency to the Canadian Armed Forces in Canada.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5799928">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill <Document DbId="9093915" Type="4">C-369</Document>, an act to amend the Bills of Exchange Act, the Interpretation Act and the Canada Labour Code, regarding national indigenous peoples day. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799929">As we spoke about this and had several witnesses come to the committee, it became evident that there was no consensus on this issue. There were a lot of differences of opinion and a lot of different ideas expressed. Not being able to reach consensus, one of the amendments I proposed was to just withdraw one of our national holidays as it is named and replace it with this particular one. That was not accepted and had to be withdrawn. However, let me say why I would suggest that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799930">The goal of the legislation is absolutely laudable for reconciliation with indigenous peoples as a national objective, but I am not sure that adding a different national holiday, as described in this process, makes sense because of the variety of opinions and reasons we heard discussed at the committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799931">The residential schools were a dark chapter in Canada's history. We understand that. In 2008, Prime Minister Harper delivered a historic apology to former students, their families and communities for Canada's role in the operation of the schools. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799932">Our former Conservative government also created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as part of the 2007 Indian residential schools settlement agreement. That agreement recognized that the residential school system had a profoundly lasting and damaging impact on indigenous culture, heritage and language. I know there are several members in the House who had connections to those residential schools. I can only speak from the opportunity I have had to visit those residential schools in recent times. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799933">My mother was a teacher who taught in a former residential school, after it had been changed from a residential school to a band-controlled school, so it was a different building at that time. I have had the opportunity to walk through residential schools with elders and listen to the stories they tell about the disastrous, horrendous things that happened to them as children in these particular schools. I have had that experience. Although that is nothing comparable, I have had a little insight. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799934">We must remember this dark chapter in our history and do our best to achieve reconciliation. However, the government must also keep its promises to improve the lives of indigenous peoples. I sat in the committee for the last number of days, hour after hour, listening to great indigenous people talk about indigenous languages and what they need to do to deal with those languages, because it is such an integral part of their lives, their communities and their nations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799935">I think about the historic challenges we have with that piece of legislation as proposed, and we have had all sorts of members in the House bring up issues about clean drinking water for reserves, improved education and improved housing. When I think about a national holiday, we have to look at the cost of this if all federal employees were on a paid holiday. What does that do for reconciliation if those people have a paid holiday? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799936">What if we were to take those hundreds of thousands of dollars, and some people would say hundreds of billions of dollars, up to a bigger number, and put that directly into the indigenous languages program? We do not have the funding in there now. Other than this term “adequate” and three commissioners, there is no funding and most of our witnesses talked about the issue of funding for indigenous languages. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799937">If we were instead to take the money that would have given federal employees a holiday and put it into the indigenous languages program, which is so critical to the foundation of these particular bands, indigenous cultures, Métis and Inuit settlements and put that money into reconciliation, into something that would work for them, that would be a benefit for their culture because it would bring their languages more to life. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="30">(1730)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5799938">We could also talk about drinking water. If we took those hundreds of millions of dollars and put it directly into drinking water, that would also be a good move.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799939">There have been many issues brought up and addressed with housing and the horrendous conditions of housing. If we took that money and instead of giving it as a holiday for federal employees, put it into housing, it would make much more sense. I suggested an amendment that we take one of our national holidays now and substitute this one in. Some indigenous groups came to see us. I understand totally that June 21, the solstice, the first day of summer, is an incredible day, one that is celebrated. Many heritage activities take place. Many schools are involved in it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799940">In many parts of the country there are many Remembrance Day activities that occur without a national holiday. Many of the witnesses at committee talked about the importance of June 21 as a celebration, a solstice, as the beginning of summer. We would all like to have it warm up a little here and spring to come soon, but the significance of June 21 was important to many of our witnesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799941">The other important one is Orange Shirt Day. Orange Shirt Day is specifically for reconciliation for the residential schools. Many of our witnesses talked about the importance of recognizing Orange Shirt Day and many of the stories we heard from witnesses were about residential schools, the challenges and the horrendous things that happened and why Orange Shirt Day was important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799942">Again, there was a difference of opinion. Some of them would say we should have recognition on June 21 and other people wanted Orange Shirt Day as recognition. I proposed removing one of the statutory holidays we have now because there was no agreement between either date. Some would say if we cannot agree on one or the other, just do both. That is not quite what the witnesses wanted either.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799943">It occurred to me that we had a very short time period trying to make a decision for other people again. When we talked to witnesses, the consultation was too short. It did not give them the time to look at this issue and discuss whether it was June 21, Orange Shirt Day or another day that could be used. They did not have the time to consult across the country and bring a voice back to us to say this is what they want. We have a piece of legislation telling them what they should do.

She told us of the spiritual significance of June 21, the summer solstice, for first nations, Métis and Inuit peoples, and she acknowledged the history for many communities of celebrations and special commemorative ceremonies on June 21. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5799967">It is a great honour to rise to speak to Bill <Document DbId="9093915" Type="4">C-369</Document>, a bill very close to my heart. It seeks to create a new federal statutory holiday for truth and reconciliation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799968">First, it is imperative that we acknowledge and thank the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214573" Type="2">Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River</Affiliation> for bringing the bill to the floor of the House for debate, but, more important, for being an extremely strong advocate for indigenous rights and advocating for indigenous people not only in her riding but across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799969">I have had the honour to speak in the House many times about our country's path toward reconciliation. It is quite clear to me that reconciliation does not belong to a single political party or an individual. Instead, it is a shared path for all Canadians. The pathway toward reconciliation is one that we must walk together, and this bill exemplifies the journey. It was honour to work with my colleagues from all political parties on the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799970">I had the privilege to sit in on testimony at the Standing Committee for Heritage, which studied the bill. It was this testimony that we heard that ultimately shaped my views on the bill and solidified my belief on the importance of passing it into law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799971">In the greater conversation about reconciliation, it would be too easy to dismiss the bill and neglect to see its importance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799972"> First, we must recognize that the act of creating a new statutory holiday is not minor in itself. In fact, this day will be the first new holiday created at the federal level in over 60 years. It joins in ranks of importance with Canada Day and Labour Day, highlighting the significance and importance of this day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799973">Second, we must consider the importance that this day will have personally for indigenous people. Throughout the witness testimony, we heard from many organizations and groups that highlighted the significance of a day of commemoration, the important need to have a day to reflect on the harm that had been historically inflicted on first nations, Inuit and Métis people. The importance is reflected by its inclusion as a call to action by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799974">I was disappointed to hear my hon. colleague from the Conservative Party, in the House last Tuesday, say that the party would not be supporting the bill. The hon. member argued that rather than creating a new holiday, an existing holiday should be appropriated and transformed. Of course, I disagree with that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799975"> The question would become this. Which other day should be appropriated? Would it be Labour Day, a day to celebrate the hard-won fights of the labour movement in Canada? Would it be Canada Day, a day meant to unite all Canadians in pride of this great nation? Would it be Remembrance Day, when we solemnly commemorate the sacrifices of our veterans, including our honoured first Nations, Inuit and Métis veterans? Which holiday would the Conservatives prefer to see reimagined?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799976">Moreover, none of the existing holidays have any significance to the indigenous community relating to the legacy of residential schools. It is my belief that it is the survivors who should have the ultimate authority over which day should be chosen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799977"> September 30 was a date chosen deliberately for its significance to indigenous people. Currently September 30 is the date of a grassroots movement, started by the formidable Phyllis Webstad, called Orange Shirt Day. It was named for the orange shirt that Ms. Webstad painstakingly selected for her first day of residential school only to have it ripped away from her upon her entrance into the school. Her orange shirt is symbolic of the culture, language and childhoods that were ripped away from the students of residential schools.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799978"> We heard at committee that September was a painful time for many indigenous people, as it was the month that their children were taken, year after year, to return to school, leaving their loved ones and communities behind.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="50">(1750)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5799979">It is appropriate to mark this pain with a solemn day of reflection and reconciliation in action. This bill represents that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799980">It has always been my belief that one of the pillars of reconciliation is education. The creation of a national day for truth and reconciliation is emblematic of education in action. Students still return to school each year in September. Beyond the great symbolic importance of this new date, it would also provide a magnificent opportunity for learning and education within our school systems. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799981">I envisage a day when schools across the country mark the holiday with ceremonies and a day of learning. It is my hope that schools will invite elders to come into classrooms to teach both indigenous and non-indigenous children about the painful history of indigenous people across the country, but also about the hope all indigenous people have for the future. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799982">I think of the way schools across the country use Remembrance Day as a learning tool for children of all ages to learn about the horrors and conflicts Canada has been involved in, and believe this new day for truth and reconciliation would be a perfect opportunity to be a learning tool for another important part of Canada's history. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799983">Unfortunately only half of Canadians are familiar with the residential school system and its long-term effects on the indigenous population. This, frankly, is a devastating and unacceptable statistic. The key, in my opinion, is to fix this statistic through education. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799984">I must emphasize the continued great work of our party and government on reconciliation and the advancement of indigenous rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799985"> ln my home province of Manitoba, I am extremely proud to celebrate with the community of Shoal Lake 40 on the progress of Freedom Road. After many years, it was our government that stepped up and pledged the necessary funding to ensure this community was finally connected to the mainland, after the construction of Winnipeg's aqueduct in 1919 turned Shoal Lake into an island. The completion of Freedom Road will allow the community to build its own water treatment plant. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799986">On the topic of access to clean water, our government has committed to ending all long-term boil water advisories by 2021, a task previous governments have neglected. Our government recognizes and affirms the right of communities to access clean and safe drinking water. I am proud to say we have been able to lift 80 long-term drinking water advisories since 2015. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799987">It is my honour to serve as the parliamentary secretary for the <Affiliation DbId="245285" Type="4">Minister of Indigenous Services</Affiliation>. Today, we tabled important legislation on the welfare of first nations, Métis and Inuit children in care. There is an ongoing crisis in indigenous communities. Too many children are being removed from their homes and communities. This crisis is particularly staggering in Manitoba. This legislation would reaffirm the inherent right of indigenous people over their own children. I look forward to the upcoming debate in the House on this very important legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799988">I have had the privilege to again attend meetings of the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage as it undertakes a study on an act respecting indigenous languages, which also seeks to implement several important calls to action. My own indigenous language, Michif, is at risk of extinction. The bill would allow for its preservation, but also for more Métis across the country to learn and revitalize it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5799989">There is much more work to be done, but we can be proud of what we have accomplished together in the last three years of government. I look forward to further advancing these files and continuing to work hard for indigenous people across our great country.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="242059" Type="18">Mr. Gary Anandasangaree (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage and Multiculturalism (Multiculturalism), Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5800014">Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by acknowledging that we are gathered here on the unceded lands of the Algonquin people and to give my thanks, first, to the member for <Affiliation DbId="214573" Type="2">Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River</Affiliation> for bringing forward this private member's motion, and second, to the heritage committee, which worked very hard over the past several months to consult and discuss with many indigenous organizations as well as individuals who came forward to give their testimony. I also want to acknowledge the hard work of the committee members, including the chair, who is the member for <Affiliation DbId="214035" Type="2">Toronto—Danforth</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800015">This bill would not be here today if not for the work of the members of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. They worked very hard, and it is very timely that we have one of the commissioners, Grand Chief Willie Littlechild, in Ottawa today. He made an enormous contribution, as did the other commissioners. I am so honoured that he is here. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800016">He spoke earlier at committee, and you could have heard a pin drop in the silence when he spoke, because he brings a lifetime of wisdom to issues of indigenous rights, both in the international context and with his work as a commissioner of the TRC. As well as being a jurist, he has played many other leadership roles within the legal community, in sports, and in many other aspects of life. It is very fortunate that he is in Ottawa today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800017">Today is, in fact, quite an important day. Earlier today our <Affiliation DbId="245285" Type="4">Minister of Indigenous Services</Affiliation> tabled legislation, Bill <Document DbId="10344307" Type="3">C-92</Document>, on child welfare issues for indigenous peoples. I believe it is a transformational piece of legislation, one that responds in many ways both to the issues that are faced within communities and to many of the complaints before the Canadian Human Rights Commission.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800018">Thus, it is a very important step forward by our government, as is the indigenous languages legislation, which was introduced by the <Affiliation DbId="241629" Type="4">minister of Canadian heritage</Affiliation> several weeks ago. In fact, the committee completed a study today, and hopefully it will advance to the other place in the next few weeks. We are very excited to have two pieces of legislation moving along that can be linked to individual calls to action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800019">With respect to this particular day, the national day for truth and reconciliation is a direct response to call to action 80. Over many years, the commissioners spoke with thousands and thousands of survivors of residential schools and came up with specific recommendations for governments to follow. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800020">There has been quite a bit of discussion, as the previous speaker mentioned, with respect to this particular day. Initially, June 21 was recommended as a celebratory day for indigenous peoples. While a lot of people agreed with that date, the general consensus leaned toward September 30, to keep in the spirit of the TRC calls to action, as well as to recognize that there are other injustices that took place relating to indigenous children. The sixties scoop is one of them. Another is the movement of individual communities in the north. There were a number of different harms that were caused by the Government of Canada in the name of the Crown.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5800021">Sadly, it is a legacy of the last 152 years that has put indigenous people in Canada in a very difficult and precarious situation, given the many social challenges we see, whether it be housing, education or water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800022">Fundamentally, however, with the leadership of our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="233806" Type="4">Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="245285" Type="4">Minister of Indigenous Services</Affiliation>, we are moving toward a path to redefine this relationship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800023">First and foremost is redefining the relationship based on the notion of inherent rights and self-determination. That is what our <Affiliation DbId="233806" Type="4">Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations</Affiliation> is undertaking. I believe there over 70 round tables where discussions are taking place to draw up specific rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800024">Concurrently, we recognize that many of the challenges we speak of, whether related to water or otherwise, need to be addressed. As a government, we have invested close to $16.8 billion over the last three years to address some of those issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800025">Having said that, there is a long way to go. It is very important that we accept the 94 calls to action identified by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. This would be an initial step toward fulfilling our obligations, and I think it is a very important step.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800026">What does this proposal mean? It means that September 30 of each year will be a national statutory holiday. We expect that it will mirror Orange Shirt Day. Nationwide, many school boards and institutions have marked Orange Shirt Day and have started the process of education to let people know of the challenges, difficulties and pain faced by residential school survivors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800027">That is a starting point. However, it is important that over the years, we elaborate on and develop more educational programs and more support that will allow this day to be marked in a solemn way that will make every Canadian reflect. My good friend, the <Affiliation DbId="242092" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Indigenous Services</Affiliation>, stated earlier that only 50% of Canadians know about residential schools. It is important that this national holiday be used as a tool to educate people. It would not be a day off for people. It would be for every community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800028">As members of Parliament, we have a presence in every part of this country. It is incumbent on us to take the lead and put on events and programs in our local communities to mark this day and make sure that the spirit of the TRC's call to action 80 is adhered to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800029">I have a couple of items to note before I conclude.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800030">First, I understand that a private member's bill for a national day of truth and reconciliation was brought forward by the member for <Affiliation DbId="214384" Type="2">Victoria</Affiliation>. Sadly, he announced today that he will not be seeking re-election. I want to acknowledge the work he has done and his extraordinary leadership and friendship. He is well regarded in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800031">Second, I want to thank all the witnesses, both individuals and communities, who came forward and supported this legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800032">As a government, we are very proud and very pleased to support this and commit to the full implementation of all 94 calls to action from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. I thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="214573" Type="2">Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River</Affiliation> for bringing this forward.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800033">Mr. Speaker, it is with great honour I rise today to speak about this significant piece of legislation. We can all agree on the importance of acknowledging the impact of Indian residential schools on first nations, Inuit and Métis people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800034">Bill <Document DbId="9093915" Type="4">C-369</Document>, an act to amend the Bills of Exchange Act, the Interpretation Act and the Canada Labour Code (National Day for Truth and Reconciliation), calls for a day of commemoration, but an essential part of this day would be about educating Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800035"> I represent an area of Montreal that is traditional indigenous territory. It does not have a reserve on it, but it has many indigenous people and was a meeting place for indigenous peoples well before my people arrived. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800036">The challenges we face as non-indigenous people in understanding what has gone on in the past are great. Before the word “reconciliation” comes the word “truth”, and that is perhaps the biggest challenge we face not only in this House but across Canada. What we still do not know is the truth. Often the truth is exceedingly painful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800037">I have had the privilege of starting on a very long path of learning an indigenous language, and not surprisingly, it has come with some surprises. As someone who was taught English and French, and has taken them both for granted, my conception of language is kind of a string on two soup cans between the people talking. It just vibrates, and that is what language is. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800038">Naively, I embarked on this attempt to learn Kanyen'kéha, or Mohawk, thinking, like an idiot, “How hard could it be?" It is exceedingly hard. Having put perhaps an hour a day into it, I come out of these learning sessions, whether I am doing passive listening or working in my workbooks, with my brain completely fried.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800039">One would think of it as if I were embarking on learning another Indo-European language that had some similarities with English and French. It is quite the contrary. It is a process of learning root words and piecing together ideas and images that are then conveyed onto other people. In this, one gains a very small glimpse into a <?bk ?>window—<?ek ?></ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800042">Mr. Speaker, this has allowed me to have a small window into what it means to understand certain concepts that were completely foreign to me, whether we are talking about creation stories or the connection of language to the land. This is something I would have entirely taken for granted two years ago had I not attempted to learn the language, however bad I am now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800043">When I talk to non-indigenous people about my learning experience, and I have received emails and phone calls, I have found that it pulls a deep emotional chord on people's heart strings, which I never realized at the outset.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800044">In Quebec, we struggled with French in a sea of English. What it does for people is entrench the deep emotional importance of who one is as a person. It is a core element of identity. It is why this government and the entire House supports the indigenous languages act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800045">My point is that as we recognize a day for truth and reconciliation, we have to come face to face with the truth before we can perfect reconciliation. That comes with a lot of emotional wounds and scars that will be reopened. We see that as we engage and go deeper in our engagement with indigenous peoples. This is not something that can be embodied in one day. However, that day would support a time of reflection for non-indigenous people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800046">When I speak to constituents who do not have any indigenous heritage, they tell me that they are very eager to learn, but the sources are not there. This would be a very small element in beginning to understand what indigenous people have gone through in this country, both the good and the bad. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800047">There is a tendency, and it is an unfortunate tendency, whether one is an advocate for indigenous issues or not, to always draw to the fore the bad things, and that has the perverse effect of re-stigmatizing. There are some good things going on in this country. I had the opportunity to have the <Affiliation DbId="233806" Type="4">Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations</Affiliation> over to my house to speak to some very powerful indigenous voices from Colombia. They were shocked that she used the word “self-determination”, because that is not something they hear from officials in their country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800048">As we take a step back and recognize what this government has achieved, there is a lot to be proud of. However, there is a lot to ask forgiveness for continuously to move forward, not for the sake of forgiveness itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800049">This would be a symbolic day. My hope is that non-indigenous Canadians will seize this as a moment of reflection to better perfect the relationship we need to have with indigenous people to move on as a country and to look at ourselves as we imagine ourselves to be but are not yet.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800051">To not love is to be fearful, to not be humble is to be self-centred, to not be honest is to be dishonest, to not be courageous is to be cowardly. In my line of work, historically and until now, when I am in the circles with indigenous people in communities, elders are very significant. The use of a circle, the teachings and learning to be humble are very significant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800052">I want to thank all hon. colleagues in the House of Commons for their time and for sharing their thoughts on Bill <Document DbId="9093915" Type="4">C-369</Document>. How we will fulfill the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's calls to action requires an active, all-party effort from everyone, and I appreciate that we saw that effort for call to action no. 80.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800053">We still have a little time before all members gather here to vote on my bill, and I want to take a moment to respond to some of the points of debate that came up. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800054">First, as I said a few nights ago, I welcome the amendments to my bill that came from a multipartisan effort to make sure this holiday was done in consultation with survivors of residential schools, with elders, with regional chiefs and with the major national indigenous organizations. The committee was thorough and well-meaning and ultimately came to the correct decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800055">June 21 will remain National Indigenous Peoples Day and be celebrated by all Canadians, including first nations, Métis and Inuit people from coast to coast to coast. September 30 will be known as the national day for truth and reconciliation and will serve as an opportunity for Canadians to reflect on the history of residential schools and how the impact of our national shame continues to live on in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800056">I have expressed my concerns about how the government will be honouring this holiday. Yes, a holiday will be created, but it is only meaningful if the resources are provided for Canadians to truly understand what that holiday means. That means a comprehensive engagement process with federal government employees to understand how their offices can meaningfully work with first nations, Métis and Inuit people. That means providing funding for cross-country memorial ceremonies done in partnership with survivors and first nations, Métis and Inuit organizations. That means creating culturally appropriate learning materials for education systems across the country, so that generations of Canadians will never forget what happened to indigenous people in this country. We are still waiting for answers to all of these questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800057">Second, there has been some conversation about replacing other holidays that already exist. That is a fair question, but a debate that should happen at a different time. Generations of indigenous people have been told time and time again that they are in the way, that their concerns are secondary to everything else going on in Canada. For generations, indigenous people have been left out of political processes, left out of decisions that affect their ways of life, left out of decisions that say what languages they can speak and what gods they can pray to. If members of this House want to discuss the number of holidays in Canada, that debate should not be associated with the importance of this bill. The loss of a colonial holiday should not come at the expense of survivors and indigenous people gaining a holiday. I refuse to believe that this holiday will bear the weight of inconvenience to a colonial system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800058">As a final thought, I want to return to the positives of this bill, because far too many of our conversations rely on reliving trauma and discussing the problems in our first nations, Métis and Inuit communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800059">This bill will not solve the housing crisis indigenous people live through and it will not fix the overrepresentation of indigenous children in foster care and it will not close the education gap that leaves indigenous children behind.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="25">(1825)</Timestamp>

It would give space and time for the government to reflect on its failures and remind itself why it so important to work for and with indigenous people every other day of the year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800061">Progress will take time, but through my bill, we are taking the time to make progress and are moving forward.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800079">We are currently facing an unprecedented crisis that strikes at the very heart of Canadian democracy and the rule of law. That is why Conservatives have called for an emergency debate tonight and why we are seized with this matter. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800080">This is not a debate about remediation agreements; this is a debate about the very essence and the core of our democracy and the integrity of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office, the integrity of the Clerk of the Privy Council and the integrity of the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800081">Yesterday at the justice committee, we heard clear, concise, meticulously documented and detailed accounts of unwanted, sustained and coordinated pressure by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the Clerk of the Privy Council, the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> and their staff on the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> to give SNC-Lavalin a special deal. It was shocking testimony. It was riveting and believable. Let me, for a moment, recount some of the things that the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> told us yesterday.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800082">She said, “I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion.... I spoke to [the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>] on this matter...and...I told him that engagements from his office to mine on SNC had to stop—that they were inappropriate. ... They did not stop.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800083">She went on to say, “Various officials also urged me to take partisan political considerations into account—which was clearly improper for me to do.” She told us that Gerry Butts, who was then the chief adviser to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, said to her, “there is no solution here that doesn't involve some interference.” Katie Telford said, “We don't want to debate legalities anymore.” PCO clerk Michael Wernick said of the Prime Minister, “I think he is gonna find a way to get it done one way or another.” The former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> said, “these events constituted pressure to intervene in a matter, and that this pressure...was not appropriate.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800084">Where did this all begin? From our knowledge, it began about four weeks ago, February 7, when a story broke in The Globe and Mail about allegations that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his office had exerted pressure on the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> to give a special deal to SNC-Lavalin. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800085">There were questions asked of the Prime Minister immediately. The media asked the Prime Minister what the former attorney general was talking about. Was there pressure applied to her? Of course the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, in his typical way, said there was nothing to see here. In fact, what he said was, “The allegations in the Globe story this morning are false. Neither the current nor the previous attorney general was ever directed by me, or by anyone in my office, to take a decision in this matter.” He then went on, as we will all recall, to blame the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation>. He said she had a different perspective. He said that if Scott Brison had not left, then none of this would have happened. His story changed over a number of weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800086">While the media and members in the House of Commons were trying to get answers form the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, in parallel, Conservatives and NDP were also trying to get the justice committee to immediately undertake hearings on this issue so that answers could be found out immediately, and we were stonewalled. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800087">First, we had to force the justice committee to meet. Then it did not want to call witnesses. Then it wanted to change the scope of what was being looked at. By the way, the Liberals on the justice committee were being directed by the <Affiliation DbId="224669" Type="4">House leader</Affiliation>'s office and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office, but after they were basically forced, kicking and screaming, into having these meetings, we then had to pressure them to invite witnesses who needed to be heard from, including the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800088">On one hand, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was denying that anything happened, saying that there was no pressure applied, that she was mistaken, that she should have gone to him, that it was all her fault for not telling him she felt pressured. Simultaneously, we were trying to get answers from the justice committee and trying to have the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> attend and give full testimony. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800089">This all culminated in what happened yesterday, where the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> did appear. She was able to give a limited amount of testimony. She was able to speak up until the point when she was fired from her position as Attorney General and became the veterans affairs minister. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800090">She was very clear, not yesterday but the day before, that she needed to be able to speak about what happened after she became veterans affairs minister, during the time when she and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> spoke in Vancouver, and about why she resigned. When asked yesterday, she indicated there was additional information that needed to be provided.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800091">This is where we find ourselves today. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is being accused of very serious things. We have a <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> who, may I remind everyone, is the Attorney General who was duly elected to this place and comes with a very impressive and solid career as a prosecutor. She was appointed by the Prime Minister because he had such faith and trust in her. Although we certainly did not agree with her politics, we would all be able to say that she certainly was a cabinet minister appointed on merit and is certainly an individual who, when she provides testimony and speaks, is incredibly believable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800092">However, we have a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who even just yesterday said, “There are disagreements in perspective on this, but I can reassure Canadians that we were doing our job”. He quite likes the word “perspective”. He went on to say, “I completely disagree with the characterization of the former attorney general about these events.” In other words, she is lying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800093">I have to pause now, because it seems to be a pattern for this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. When people, and it seems especially women, say no to him, there seems to be a pattern to his attack on them and then his patronizing characterization of what they recollect. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800094">I want to remind everyone of what happened this past summer, when the allegation and story came out that, 18 years prior, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who was a young man, an almost 30-year-old man, had groped a woman in the Kokanees at a festival. When this story was brought to light just this summer, he was asked about it. What was the first thing he said on July 1? He said that it did not happen. He said, “I remember that day” and “I don't remember any negative interactions that day at all.” A few days later, he was pressed further, so then he said that often a man experiences interactions differently that may be inappropriate, but that we have to respect that and reflect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800095">A few days later, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> goes on again and starts his social thought process. He said, “I think people understand that every situation is different and we have to reflect and take seriously every situation on a case-by-case basis.” It is just a lot of word salad. What he never says is that he did it, he was wrong and he apologizes because it was the wrong thing to do. That seemed to be what his take was on that. The woman in that scenario was not interested in talking. I think she had had about enough of that Prime Minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800096">Although we find ourselves in a somewhat similar situation today, we have a woman who is not going to back down and will have her story heard. She will speak truth to power. However, we certainly are seeing the same type of approach from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to what are not just allegations but to what are very credible recollections, which we have seen from the testimony.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800097">First of all, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> says that it did not happen. He then, in a roundabout way, degrades her and patronizingly says that it was just her perspective. What he does not do is take responsibility, clearly and openly and transparently take responsibility. If we line up everything we have heard the Prime Minister say to date against what we heard the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> say, we have one individual, the former attorney general, who was clear, documented and kept records. When talking with this woman, people better know she is clearly somebody who is not thinking about something else. She is keeping track of what people are saying. People should not think for one minute that they are going to fool her or get past anything she is involved with. That was very clear yesterday.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800098">Then we have a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who is evasive every time he is asked a question, uses three or four words that are very legally precise and is far from transparent.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800099">Where does this leave us? This leaves us at a crisis. We have a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who cannot admit that he has done something wrong and cannot take responsibility for it. He should own up to it, say it was wrong and change it, although at this point that would be too little, too late. However, if we do not have a Prime Minister who can be truthful, we cannot trust him to get to the bottom of this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800100">There has been some discussion about having an inquiry. Frankly, I do not trust the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to call one. I do not trust the Prime Minister to allow the right witnesses to appear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800101">This is why we are in a crisis at the very heart of our democracy. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> does not have the moral authority to continue. He must resign.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800103">It was refreshing to see the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former minister</Affiliation> speak and to have privilege waived so that she was able to speak yesterday.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800104">I want to underscore the important testimony she gave. Some of that testimony was recounted by the member opposite, although not in its entirety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800105"> First, the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> stated that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> told her it was her decision to make. Second, she noted that the PMO staff said they did not want to cross any lines. Third, she said that it was appropriate to discuss job impacts. Fourth, she said that nothing that occurred was unlawful. Fifth, she said she was never directed. Sixth, and perhaps most importantly, she indicated that the state of our institutions and the independence of our processes is indeed strong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800106">Given the record of what we heard, does the member opposite think it is important to allow the committee to continue its important work? It has called at least four witnesses thus far, excluding the academic witnesses. Just today, it decided that it will also call the former principal secretary and will ask the deputy minister and the Clerk of the Privy Council to return. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800107">Madam Speaker, this is the problem we have. Anyone who watched the testimony would never characterize it in the way the member opposite characterized it. His characterization was that she said there was no problem, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said it was her decision, the staff members were not trying to pressure her and that everything was good. That was not the testimony I heard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800108">Members can bet it was her decision. She said to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his people a number of times that it was her decision to make and she had made it. She basically said, “The lady's not for turning”. Then the Prime Minister's staff members said that they did not want to impose political pressure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800109">The PMO and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> are very good at saying one thing and doing another. I have no doubt that is what the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was trying to pull with her, but it was not about to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800110">Her testimony was not refreshing. It was disturbing. It was sad. It was appalling. We do not need to hear words like “refreshing”, “wonderful” and “perspective”.

              <ParaText id="5800121">Madam Speaker, I do not know where to begin tonight. What we heard yesterday was truly shocking, and shook me to my core. We have in front of us a crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800122"> Every government has scandals. Every government has issues and mistakes it has to deal with. That is true of the previous government. It is also true of the current government. However, what we have in front of us today is a constitutional crisis that strikes at the very heart of our institutions and the principles on which they are based. It is a crisis about the division of powers in the country; the long held and sacred principles on which these divisions of powers are based; the division of power between the judicial and executive branches of government; and the principles that are enshrined in our Constitution, written and unwritten. They are enshrined in our statutes, like the justice act, and other acts of Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800123">It is also a crisis about the rule of law, a foundational principle on which the country is based. In fact, it is so foundational that when we repatriated the Constitution in 1982 and when we adopted the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, that part of the Constitution led with the words that Canada was founded on the principles of a belief in the supremacy of God and the rule of law. If we do not consider this as a House of Commons, as committees of the House, as institutions of state, to be a crisis, then we have an even bigger problem: institutions that are incapable of regulating power and regulating abuses of power. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800124">What we heard yesterday at the justice committee was truly shocking, and shook me to my core. We heard casual and flip comments that certain laws were not as important because they were passed under a previous government. We heard casual comments that we should not concern ourselves about the legalities of a situation. We heard comments that we were not going to relent and let up on the interference. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800125">It was clear through yesterday's testimony in front of the justice committee that there was a prolonged and sustained campaign to convince the most senior law officer of Canada, the attorney general, to change her mind in respect to a decision she had already taken, to put pressure on her in a sustained and prolonged fashion to change her mind and to interfere in a criminal prosecution. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800126">This is so shocking it is hard to know where to begin. Our country is founded on these divisions of powers, and not just Canada. All western democracies, for a very long time, have been founded on the concept that we have three branches of the state, executive, legislative and judicial, and that these three branches are independent of each other and should hold each other in check and balance. What we saw yesterday was a complete violation of that fundamental principle in a way that was so casual and so flip that it shook me to my core. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800127">What we also saw yesterday was a government that did not even seem to understand the principle of the rule of law, the idea that every person in our country is to be treated equally under the law and is to be afforded the same rights under the law. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800140">The second person said, “I think Canadians should feel assured that they work in a democracy under the rule of law....Canadians need to be assured that their police and investigators with the power of the state operate independently and that the prosecution service, the state charging people with offences, are completely independent.” </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800152">Madam Speaker, I would like to begin by reiterating our respect for and our confidence in the two independent processes that are currently under way. Members are already well aware that the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights is holding hearings on the issue and the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner's investigation will provide a non-partisan perspective. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800154">With respect to the two processes, we firmly believe that these processes will be thoroughly and fairly conducted and that they will allow facts and multiple perspectives to be shared. The <Affiliation DbId="245290" Type="96">Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada</Affiliation> already appeared voluntarily before the committee on Thursday, February 21, and he will continue to offer his full co-operation with that committee.

              <ParaText id="5800155">As we have seen, committee work provides detailed information to parliamentarians on issues of concern to the electorate and often provokes important public debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800156">In addition, because committees interact directly with the public, they provide an immediate and visible conduit between elected representatives and Canadians. Committees can gather the information necessary for their studies in a number of ways. Most often, committees gather information on a particular subject by hearing from witnesses, as we saw with the meetings of February 21, 25 and 27, and accepting briefs and written opinions. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800157">As we know, the committee in this case has already held three meetings on the subject of remediation agreements, the Shawcross doctrine and discussions between the office of the Attorney General and government colleagues. If I may, parenthetically, as a constitutional lawyer, to hear such robust discussion here in this chamber and at committee about such a hitherto relatively unknown doctrine as the Shawcross doctrine has indeed warmed the cockles of my heart.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800158">On Thursday, February 21, the committee heard from the current <Affiliation DbId="245290" Type="96">Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada</Affiliation>; the deputy minister of justice and deputy attorney general of Canada, Madame Nathalie Drouin; and the Clerk of the Privy Council, Mr. Michael Wernick. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800164"> In her testimony, Nathalie Drouin explained that the director of public prosecutions is responsible for initiating and conducting federal criminal prosecutions on behalf of the Crown.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800165"> She added that while the director of public prosecutions is responsible for conducting federal criminal prosecutions, she can support the Attorney General and provide him with legal advice in exercising his powers under the Director of Public Prosecutions Act.

              <ParaText id="5800167">At the committee, Mary Condon, another witness, helpfully added, “It is now established by constitutional convention that the attorney general will make an independent decision to prosecute or not to prosecute. This requires making a two-step determination”, which we heard about but bears underscoring, “about, first, the sufficiency of the evidence and, second, whether the prosecution is in the public interest. Because of the necessity to consider the public interest, commentators often say that the prosecutorial decisions made by an attorney general are at the intersection of law and politics.... </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800168">“As Professor Edwards argues in his book, 'The task of the attorney general or [the director of public prosecutions] is a difficult exercise of weighing a number of competing considerations.' It's is in this context that the Shawcross Doctrine becomes relevant.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800169"> With respect to what the Clerk of the Privy Council has said, during his testimony, Mr. Michael Wernick explained, “If you boil it down for Canadians as to what is going on here with the facts that we have and all of the facts that I know from my participation in meetings and conversations, we are discussing lawful advocacy.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800170"> He went on to say, “I can tell you my view very firmly is that [the conversations with the former minister of justice and attorney general] were entirely appropriate, lawful, legal.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800171">In order to facilitate the work of ongoing investigations, we announced an unprecedented waiver that is intended to fully sweep away obstacles. The exceptional waiver, which was passed by an order in council, addresses cabinet confidentiality, solicitor-client privilege and any other duties of confidentiality, to the extent that they apply. That waiver should remove any doubt as to the ability of any person who engaged in discussions on this matter to fully participate in the committee process. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800172">We took this step because we know that it was important for Canadians that the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> be able to speak openly at the justice committee. Importantly, that waiver also empowers others who had discussions on the subject matter, such as former principal secretary Mr. Butts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800173">As we have said many times, solicitor-client privilege is an important part of the Canadian legal system and should only be waived in the appropriate circumstances. It is an important protection that allows lawyers across the country to engage on the toughest issues and provide their clients with candid advice. That includes the Attorney General of Canada, who is the government's lawyer. As the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> has stated, the issue of solicitor-client privilege is complex and layered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800174">That being said, our government has been clear from the outset that we have been seeking to provide the utmost transparency in this matter without jeopardizing active court cases, of which there are two. Let me underscore: there is the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, and there is secondarily a judicial review, which has been initiated by SNC-Lavalin. Two cases are currently before the courts in this country at this time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800175">We have delivered on our commitment by providing Canadians with the transparency they deserve and fairness to the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> in a way that preserves, rather than undermines, solicitor-client privilege, the right to a fair hearing in cases that are currently active, the integrity of the position of the director of public prosecutions and the rule of law in our country more generally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800176">The integrity of judicial proceedings is a priority for our government, as it should be for any government. That is why the waiver does not cover any information shared by the director of public prosecutions with the former minister in relation to SNC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800177">Let us talk about the committee. This has already been the subject of some of the opening interventions in the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800178">Committees of the House do very good work. In this case, the justice committee has heard from numerous witnesses. Just yesterday, it heard over four hours of testimony from the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> herself, where not only the three recognized parties were able to participate but the Bloc Québécois participated, the Green Party participated, and even the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation of Canada participated in questions. That is a good day for parliamentary democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800179">The committee has indicated that it is prepared to hear from more witnesses, and indeed, it has already taken that step. I refute outright the opening statement made by the member for <Affiliation DbId="214460" Type="2">Portage—Lisgar</Affiliation> in which she stated that the committee was somehow coerced into calling witnesses.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="10">(1910)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5800180">At its opening meeting, the committee decided to call three witnesses. At its second meeting, it added to the witness list. At its third meeting, today, on procedural matters, it added a further three witnesses. What she said is simply wrong and needs to be refuted on the record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800181">We on this side of the House have confidence in the committee process. That is why we have empowered committee members. That is why we have resourced committees. We are confident that the committee hearings, at both this committee and other committees, will continue to be thoroughly and fairly conducted, and we will provide Canadians with the answers and the information they seek. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800182">What I need to say at this point is that in the meantime, while the committee is undertaking this important work, we as a government remain keenly focused on Canadians and addressing their needs. I will cite just one example. We heard this week the numbers from Statistics Canada about who is living in poverty and who has been extracted from poverty in Canada. According to Statistics Canada, 825,000 Canadians have been lifted out of poverty since we took office, including 283,000 children. Those include children in my riding of Parkdale—High Park, where $3.5 million is delivered tax free every month to 10,520 children to help them and their families pay for basic necessities. Those are some of the things we are focused on, in terms of Canadians' needs, while the committee undertakes its important work. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800183">Let us talk briefly about the roles and responsibilities of the director of public prosecutions and prosecutors that are authorized to act on that director's behalf, which is set out in the Director of Public Prosecutions Act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800184">The Public Prosecution Service of Canada, the PPSC, fulfills the responsibilities of the Attorney General of Canada in the discharge of the Attorney General's criminal law mandate by prosecuting offences that fall within federal jurisdiction, criminal offences, and by contributing to strengthening the criminal justice system. The creation of the PPSC reflected the decision to make transparent the principle of prosecutorial independence, free from any improper influence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800185">To that end, in a statement published on February 12, 2019, in relation to a different matter, the prosecution of Mark Norman, the director of public prosecutions, Madame Kathleen Roussel, stated, “I am confident that our prosecutors, in this and every other case, exercised their discretion independently and free from any political or partisan consideration.” </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="5800186">Under the Department of Justice Act, the Attorney General is responsible for the regulation of the conduct of all litigation for or against the Crown or any department. In the conduct of civil litigation, the Attorney General does not have exclusive decision-making power over litigation positions. In civil litigation, it is often very difficult to sift through the available and viable legal arguments to determine what position needs to be taken in a given case. In that sense, civil litigation is markedly different from criminal litigation. The work of identifying those who need to be prosecuted for a given crime, deciding whether proceedings should be initiated, and determining sentences needs to be based on the evidence alone, to ensure that criminal justice is properly administered. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800187">However, it is always advisable for the Attorney General to be informed of the relevant context, including the potential consequences of a given prosecution. As we know, the Attorney General can issue directives to the director of public prosecutions that may be general or pertain to specific prosecutions. When a directive is issued, it is issued through a totally transparent process. It is published in the Canada Gazette and accessible to all Canadians. What is more, a general directive must be preceded by a consultation with the director of public prosecutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800188"> The Attorney General may, after consulting the director of public prosecutions, assume conduct of the prosecution. This is also done through a transparent process in which the Attorney General must publish a notice of intent to assume conduct of a prosecution in the Canada Gazette.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800189">With respect to third-party involvement, it is quite appropriate for the Attorney General to consult with cabinet colleagues before exercising his or her power to issue directives or initiate prosecutions under the Director of Public Prosecutions Act. Consultations are often important, since the Attorney General must hear perspectives that go beyond a particular case. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="15">(1915)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5800190">If the Attorney General decides to issue a directive or to assume conduct of the prosecution, he or she must make the final decision. It is important to note that the Attorney General has the final say.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800191">To maintain the director's independence, all of the Attorney General's instructions must be in writing and published in the Canada Gazette.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800192">The director must inform the Attorney General of any prosecution, or intervention that the director intends to make, that raises important questions of general interest. This gives the Attorney General the opportunity to intervene in proceedings or to assume conduct of a prosecution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800193">Furthermore, the Public Prosecution Service of Canada must provide an annual report to the Attorney General to be tabled in Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800194">Prosecutorial independence is truly the cornerstone of our democracy, as shown by the relationship between the Attorney General of Canada and the director of public prosecutions. This builds confidence in the justice system and guarantees that prosecutions will not be perceived as being unduly influenced by politics. Instead, federal offences are prosecuted by experienced, qualified prosecutors across the country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800195">I would like to refer to some of the testimony that we heard before the standing committee. First is testimony is from the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation>, who testified yesterday. What she said specifically is that “I do not want members of this committee or Canadians to think that the integrity of our institutions has somehow evaporated. The integrity of our justice system, the integrity of the director of public prosecutions and prosecutors is intact.” That is a quote from the member for <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">Vancouver Granville</Affiliation> directly, from yesterday's testimony.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800196">A second quote from a different witness reiterated the exact same point, saying “I think Canadians should feel assured that they work in a democracy under the rule of law.” The witness continued, “I think Canadians need to be assured that their police and investigators with the power of the state operate independently and that the prosecution service and the state charging people with offences are completely independent. There is a legislative and statutory shield around that which demonstrably is working.” That was the Clerk of the Privy Council.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800197">That is important testimony, because it underscores the very important point that was introduced into this debate by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="213919" Type="2">Wellington—Halton Hills</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800198">Our government is unwavering in its commitment to maintaining public confidence in the administration of justice and in the independence of the judiciary.

              <ParaText id="5800201">That is the point of these kinds of agreements. It is not some sort of <I>laissez-passer</I> for individuals. It is about holding corporate leaders responsible for their activities, making sure they are held accountable, but not de facto or actually in fact holding responsible workers on the front lines, pensioners who rely upon that corporation for their pensions, for actions that were not taken by them and decisions that were not made by them. They should not be the sacrificial lambs for this kind of policy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800203">As I mentioned in the statement, and I will conclude on this point, on February 12 the director of public prosecutions stated, “I am confident that our prosecutors, in this and every...case, exercise their discretion independently and free from any political or partisan consideration.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800204">That directly responds to the concerns about the rule of law, the independence of our processes and the independence of the judiciary. Those are important points that all 338 of us must share and do share. That is not being encroached upon here. What is being discussed is a specific case that does not touch upon the rule of law, which remains intact, thankfully, in this country.</ParaText>

One is that in direct response to the member opposite, the witness list was not closed and has not been closed since the outset of this process. In that original Wednesday meeting during that constituency week, the decision was made to call three witnesses and to determine if other witnesses would be necessary. As I referenced in my opening comments, since that time, on two different occasions, including today, the witness list has indeed been expanded. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800215"> What we are not doing is what the previous government did in the past, when the Conservatives actually issued a rule book to committee chairs to instruct them on how to obstruct the committee process in 2006, which was then leaked to Don Martin at CTV, who exposed it for the nation to observe. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800237">Madam Speaker, deferred prosecution agreements or, as they are known, remediation agreements in Canada are central to this debate because they focus on exactly what the member has just mentioned, the public interest. That is not a concept that has been picked up in Canada alone. Five members of the G7 now have this regime in their countries: France, Japan, the United States, the U.K. and now Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800238">This is important because, as I mentioned in my opening comments, it ensures that corporate leaders are held responsible for their behaviour and that unwitting and innocent employees and pensioners are not. It does so by requiring them to forfeit assets. It requires them to admit their guilt. It requires them to participate in investigations to show responsibility for their actions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800239">Those are important aspects that have not been underscored in this debate, and need to be, because the rhetoric from the other side is that some corporate leaders are being let off.

              <ParaText id="5800255">My friend had two defences when he did talk about substance ever so briefly.

The other one, which we have heard the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> use in one of his many excuses, was that we had another process, which is the independent Office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner. He told us not to worry as a complaint was made by my hon. friend. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800256">All of a sudden we are supposed to think that is a great institution, except for one thing. There is not a chance that the institution is going to find there is a problem here because it does not have jurisdiction over the issue at question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800257">Section 9, which is the basis of the complaint, goes like this, that public officers are prohibited from seeking to influence a decision of another person so as to improperly further another person's private interests. Guess what. The former Commissioner, Mary Dawson, made clear on I do not know how many cases that this only included economic interests, money, not private political interests. This smokescreen surely will not work, but it was a good try.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800258">Let us talk about justice committee on which I am honoured to be vice chair. I want to say at the outset that I have enormous respect for that committee and particularly the Chair. I admire the way in which the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214027" Type="2">Mount Royal</Affiliation> has conducted our hearings. He has done so in a very fair manner in very difficult circumstances, and that is not a surprise. He is a very intelligent, well-meaning individual who has led us to unanimous reports on just about everything we have done in the years I have been on that committee.

The hon. parliamentary secretary says that it is great that we have a process whereby we will hear from the former <Affiliation DbId="214323" Type="21">attorney general</Affiliation> and then a couple of other witnesses will be dribbled out and maybe if we need them, we will get to the others.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="35">(1935)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5800260">How can a person listen to what the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> said yesterday and not cry out for those 11 people she named to be put on the stand and be cross-examined? How can we not hear them? Maybe we will, and we should not worry. That is not good enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800261">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> made a great deal of waiving the so-called solicitor-client privilege. The lawyers I have talked to have great doubts whether that even applies. Let us say it does. Certainly, cabinet confidentiality applies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800262">What the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> did was quite interesting. He said that he was going to waive it up until that magic moment when she was removed as attorney general. Everything after that, we could not go there. What happened after that? She resigned. Listening to her testimony yesterday, she was very careful to not tell us why.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800263">We saw the principal secretary of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, Mr. Butts, tender a letter of resignation and mysteriously reference the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation>. Why? We cannot go there. We are not going to be allowed to know anything about what happened after she was removed from her job as the Attorney General of Canada. Why? Maybe someday the Liberals will waive it. I asked that yesterday at committee. Members may have heard that. The Liberals, to a person, voted me down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800264"> I stood in the House today and asked the government if it would change that and allow us to get to the truth, so Canadians watching, who are concerned about our democracy, would have the opportunity to see it all, to learn it all and to hear the whole story. I am sad to say that was also refused.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800265">Therefore, we have a Conflict of Interest Commissioner who has no ability to get at this at all. We have a justice committee that seems to want to vote against any effort to get at the truth. What are we left with? We are left with the imperative to have a judicial inquiry into this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800266"> The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has said that the best disinfectant is sunlight. People may remember, with sadness I hope, what happened when the Gomery inquiry shone a light into what happened in the sponsorship scandal. The government changed as a result because Canadians got to understand corruption at the highest level. We had the Charbonneau Commission. People were riveted to that because we got to understand how that system worked. We have had inquiries in my fair province of British Columbia, which I am not very proud of as well, about corruption over the years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800267">If we cannot get these institutions to do their jobs, the Conflict of Interest Commissioner or the justice committee, because the government will vote with the majority to swat down our efforts to get to the truth, then we need to have a public inquiry. There is no other way around it. Canadians deserve it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800268">Again, if Canadians did not watch the testimony of the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> yesterday, they must. They must hear her devastating, chronological, careful, sophisticated account of what she experienced. Among the things she experienced was an attempt to browbeat her to change her mind. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800269">I said earlier and will say again. No one sang, “Please don't remind us that somehow it's not appropriate to talk in cabinet about the economic and political ramifications of a decision.” The Shawcross principle, which we have learned so much about, says that once a decision is made, that is it. The former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> said as clearly and as often as she could that she would not interfere with her independent director of public prosecutions. She should have said, “What part of no don't you understand?” when the Clerk of the Privy Council threatened her. There were veiled threats, not just once, twice, but three times in one day she told us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800270"> We have a sad story for which Canadians deserve to get an answer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800271">Do we live in a democracy, which I have been proud of all my life to be part of, where the rule of law means something, where we do not have politicians telling our law enforcement community what to do, or do we live in a system like in some other fledgling democracies in other parts of the world where politicians call the shots? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800272">A line was crossed here, if one believes even a little of what the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> had to say. We have to hear from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. I support this motion. Canadians deserve to know what happened.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800289">Madam Speaker, it is always a great honour to rise in the House and represent the people of Timmins—James Bay and the New Democratic Party on the ethics file. However, I am not proud that we have come to this point, because we are talking about a fundamental crisis that has occurred in our country, because the veil has been pulled back, thanks to the courage of the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation>, to show us how corrupt the culture of insiders is in Ottawa. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800290">I want to preface this by saying there are two betrayals we are dealing with. One is the attempt to undermine the rule of law. I refer to a former Liberal attorney general, Michael Bryant, who said, we are dealing with “a constitutional crisis far worse than what I envisioned” and “a bald attempt by the Prime Minister to exercise his cabinet-making power over [the] quasi-judicial authority” of the Attorney General. He went on to say that he has never seen it used in such a “brazen, reckless fashion.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800291">That is the subject of why we are here tonight. However, for people who are watching there is an equally great betrayal. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> gave people hope. He made people believe that politics could be different in Ottawa. We ran against him and we ran against his party, but I have to admit that I came in 2015 thinking that maybe he was serious about open government, maybe he was serious about reconciliation, and just maybe he was serious about the middle class he always spoke about. Many people and I know many of my friends in the Liberal Party share those values, and they are hurting tonight. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800292">However, there is another Liberal Party, the old Liberal Party of corruption, insiders and cronies, and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had not even set up shop when the lobbyists began moving into town. What we have seen here is the power of the rich to call into the Prime Minister's Office and get things moved. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800293">For example, KPMG established an illegal offshore tax fraud system for billionaires. When it was found out, suddenly, miraculously, there were no criminal penalties. We all wondered how that could happen, but the fog on the Liberal side was that they did not know. An agreement was made. Then the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> appointed a KPMG executive as the treasurer for the Liberal Party, because that way of doing business is something he is comfortable with. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800294">We never got to see the raw exercise of power until yesterday, when the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> spoke truth to power. She said that she experienced “a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the Attorney General”. What she experienced were the powerful men and women around the Prime Minister's Office trying to intimidate her and to threaten her. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800295">That was an amazing moment when she talked about the Clerk of the Privy Council, who has completely betrayed his obligation to the Canadian people to be the non-partisan voice of principle. He was the one used to be the thug. I asked her, “Did he threaten you?” She said he not only threatened her once but three times in that meeting. During that meeting she was concerned that the “other shoe” was going to drop. We will get to that other shoe in a moment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800296">I want to talk about the very first meeting, when she met with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> about this, when the director of public prosecutions had made the determination that SNC-Lavalin was not eligible for this deferred prosecution agreement, a deferred prosecution law that was written specifically for SNC. SNC-Lavalin was so bad it could not even meet the criteria of a law that had been handwritten for it and stuffed into an omnibus bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800297">What did the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> say? He was with the clerk and the clerk said there was going to be a board meeting on Thursday. How were they making those connections? They were talking about the shareholders they were meeting and they had to have that decision. The Prime Minister jumped in and said he was an MP from Quebec, the member for Papineau. The Prime Minister established that his main priority was saving his own political rear end. That is why this began. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800298">Then we see the interference by the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> and his staff. She told him that it was unacceptable, and they continued. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800299">I want to get to Gerry Butts and Katie Telford, who then met with her. Gerry Butts said he did not like the law. He called it a Harper law. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="50">(1950)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5800300">I do not like very many things Stephen Harper ever did. In fact, I do not know if I can count one or two. However, the rule of law is the rule of law. Liberals do not get to say, “Oh, that was a Conservative law so we are going to ignore it.” She told him, “It is the law of the land.” It was a good law to hold political corruption accountable internationally. That is what Gerry Butts did not like.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800301">Then he said that there was going to be no solution that did not involve interference. For any member on that side to stand up and claim that this was just the normal activities, it may be the normal activities of the corrupt old Liberal Party, but this is not the normal activities of how the judicial system works, that it cannot be done without interference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800302">Then Katie Telford said that she was not interested in legalities. This woman still has her job. If there is a person in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office who does not give a tinker's darn about the rule of law, they have no business being there. What did Katie say? Katie said, “Hey, if you have any problems with it, we'll just get some prominent, important Liberal people to write some op-eds to cover it off.” That is the corrupt old Liberal way of doing business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800303">However, they were standing up against an <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> who said no, and who said that she was “waiting for that other shoe to drop”, which I spoke of before. She knew it was coming, and it did come. They told her she was being replaced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800304">The most damning testimony of all was that the Clerk of the Privy Council told her staff that the first order of business of the new <Affiliation DbId="245290" Type="96">Attorney General</Affiliation> would be to put that SNC-Lavalin deal through. That is unconscionable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800305">I want to say personally that I have never made a secret of some of the major battles I have had with the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation>. The role of the justice department lawyers in suppressing evidence in the case of the St. Anne's Indian Residential School has shaken me in my political life. I have never felt confidence in the judicial system for indigenous people because of the role of the justice department in suppressing that evidence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800306">I went to the Minister of Indigenous Affairs who landed the campaign against the St. Anne's survivors, and I begged him to stop. I begged him to stop this attack on people who had suffered so much. I approached the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">Attorney General</Affiliation>, but she was the solicitor of the client, Indian Affairs. I make no apologies for my anger about her failings then.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800307">However, I learn now, thanks to the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation>, that what was going on behind the scenes was that she had come to Ottawa to deal with reconciliation, but what was she getting stuck with? She was getting stuck with looking after the rich friends of the Liberal Party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800308">We were very frustrated that the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> was not moving on the indigenous framework. Then we find out, through this testimony, that she was not given the indigenous framework. The Liberal government was not interested in her doing the indigenous framework. It wanted her to cut a deal for their rich insider friends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800309">Last night, when I sat at that committee, I watched integrity. I watched someone who put her political career on the line, and maybe has finished her political career, but she was not going to be intimidated and she was not going to be silenced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800310">I urge my friends in the Liberal Party who are as sickened in their core as I am, and I know many of them are, do not go into the smear campaign, do not continue this attack on her, do not say it was her father pulling her strings, do not say that she could not take the stress, and do not, and I am calling on my colleagues over there, do not do the next step that the Liberal government is going to do, which is starting the attack on her credibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800311">It is one woman who stood up to this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, one woman who said what he was doing was unconscionable.

              <ParaText id="5800372">Madam Speaker, I also want to talk about transparency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800373">Before the 2011 election, the government had several ministers who are still here on the other side of the House. The Conservative government told Canadians not to worry because the fighter jets would cost $10 billion. What did the previous government do to be transparent on that issue? It did not do anything special in terms of waiving cabinet confidentiality. It never waived solicitor-client privilege. It never did those things. Canadians had to wait for the Auditor General to table a report to learn the truth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800374">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has done something unprecedented, in recent history, by waiving cabinet confidentiality to allow the former attorney general to testify before the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. Opposition members are still refusing to recognize that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800375">Last week, they wanted to hear from the former attorney general. She had the opportunity to speak before the committee, and that is what is important. That is the difference between us and the official opposition.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="5800376">I want to get into the issue of the integrity framework, because it is an important issue. We have been attacked again by the opposition, which is saying that somehow we are conspiring with one company to change the integrity framework. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800377">I have worked on the integrity framework, and we often talked about the 10-year ban on companies being allowed to bid for government contracts. I know this policy has continuously changed since 2012. I recall when the government of the day was the Harper government, and now a lot of MPs, including former cabinet ministers, now sit on the other side. At the time, the government of the day recognized that if affiliates were caught because of corrupt practices in other countries, employees in Canada should not pay the price because of that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800378">This is exactly what is at issue. The issue is whether employees, pensioners and shareholders pay the price because of a few corrupt individuals in a company. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800379">I go back to my role as an MP. I would fight for those jobs any day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800380">Finally, I want to talk about the testimony yesterday.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800381">This was not a question asked by members on this side of the House and it was not a question asked by the official opposition; it was a question asked by the member for <Affiliation DbId="214590" Type="2">Skeena—Bulkley Valley</Affiliation>. He asked the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> whether there was any illegal activity conducted in this activity, and she said no, absolutely not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800382">The <Affiliation DbId="232946" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> stood up yesterday at seven o'clock and did a big press release. He talked about interfering in the judicial process, while at the same time directing the police to investigate this particular issue, knowing full well that the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> said that there was no criminal activity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800383">I will end my speech here, but any MP should fight for jobs.

              <ParaText id="5800399"> I was there observing her in person as she came before the justice committee. Her testimony was disturbing and, frankly, explosive.

              <ParaText id="5800400">She painted a picture about the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his PMO. It is a pretty ugly one, a pretty sad one.

              <ParaText id="5800402">When our <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> met with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> on September 17, he raised the SNC-Lavalin issue immediately.

              <ParaText id="5800406">Then what happened was a coordinated campaign, with 10 meetings and 10 phone calls, involving the highest officials in this government: the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself, the Prime Minister's chief of staff, the Prime Minister's principal secretary, the Prime Minister's chief Quebec adviser and the Clerk of the Privy Council, among others.

              <ParaText id="5800408">I have been astounded that Liberal members opposite have had the audacity, and have been so shameless, to stand in their places and claim, with straight faces, that these discussions were all about doing what was in the public interest. Based on the evidence of the former attorney general, among the things that were discussed in an effort to pressure or coerce her to obstruct justice were included the Quebec election, which I am sure is in the public interest; the fact that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is from Montreal, which is really consistent with the public interest; the value of SNC-Lavalin shares; and that SNC-Lavalin's counsel is not a shrinking violet, as the Clerk of the Privy Council told her. Is that in the public interest?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800409">Gerald Butts told the former attorney general that “there is no solution here that does not involve some interference.” Does that sound like the public interest? How about Katie Telford? She said, “We don't want to debate legalities anymore.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800410">None of those matters in any way have anything to do with the public interest. They are not factors that legitimately could be considered by the former attorney general in the exercise of her prosecutorial discretion when taking into account the public interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800411">What those statements also demonstrate is the total lack of respect for the rule of law by this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, by his chief of staff, by his principal secretary, by the Clerk of the Privy Council and others. They knew that what they were doing was wrong. They knew that what they were doing crossed the line. However, they did not care, because they thought they could get away with it. They thought they were too powerful to obey the law. They thought they would never be caught. They thought that the former attorney general would succumb to the pressure, because in addition to all these totally inappropriate considerations, she was repeatedly threatened that she would be fired. Boy, did they ever underestimate the former attorney general.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800412">The Clerk of the Privy Council called her immediately after speaking with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, what a coincidence, and threatened her not once, not twice, but three times and told her that the Prime Minister was going to get his way and that there were problems with the Prime Minister not being on the same page as the attorney general. When she did not cave, the Prime Minister, at the very first opportunity, fired her as the Attorney General, all because she would not succumb to the pressure, all because she had too much integrity to break the law. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800413">We have a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who has a lot, therefore, to answer. It is very clear that all along, he was up to his eyeballs in this sordid affair. This Prime Minister has repeatedly been untruthful. He has repeatedly failed to come clean with the facts.

              <ParaText id="5800418">The point I want to raise with respect to the speech by the member opposite is that he has again indicated that we are talking about the context of these remediation agreements. Let us be clear that what the remediation agreements seek to do is hold responsible those who have actually made decisions at the corporate leadership level and render not responsible those who were not responsible for wrongdoing, such as employees, customers, pensioners and others. I would put to him that this is exactly why these agreements have been incorporated in five of the G7 nations.

What new evidence were they providing her? Nothing. What they were doing was simply threatening her and talking to her about partisan political considerations.

              <ParaText id="5800430">Madam Speaker, like my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="213892" Type="2">St. Albert—Edmonton</Affiliation>, it is troubling that we have to be here this evening on this subject. For Canadians watching, we are not talking about remediation agreements. We are talking about a constitutional crisis. We are talking about a crisis of leadership in this place and in this country. It is very concerning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800431">Across the country, on the editorial pages today, from many non-partisan sources, we heard great concern. We heard, in fact, from a former judge, who said, “It’s fair to say it’s a constitutional crisis.” From the former Liberal Ontario attorney general we heard, “It opens the door to prosecuting enemies of the government and giving immunity to friends, which is despotic.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800432">It is very disappointing that while we stand here and raise these very important issues, my colleagues across the way chuckle, snicker and laugh. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800433">We are devoted to getting to the bottom of this very serious issue. The issue is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s coordinated campaign to undermine the rule of law and force the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> to drop the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, to the benefit, as far as we can tell, of his friends, and to the protection of which jobs? It is his own job. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800434">We have also heard from members opposite that it is about jobs. They should know that they can create jobs and an environment that is favourable for the creation jobs and that they can protect jobs without breaking the law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800435">The account related to us by the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> last night was nothing short of shocking. Her account detailed 10 meetings, 10 phone calls, involving 11 senior government officials. It does not get any more senior than the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the chief of staff to the Prime Minister, the principal secretary to the Prime Minister and the Clerk of the Privy Council, to name a few. According to the former attorney general, the objective of these meetings was very clear. It was to influence her, bully her and convince her to stop the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800436">Not surprisingly, the Liberal members of the justice committee tried to paint her testimony as without merit because she did not quit cabinet right away. We have heard from members opposite that the system is still intact. The only reason the judiciary was protected is because of the integrity of the now former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800437">She said, “I resigned from cabinet because I did not have confidence to sit around the cabinet table. That's why I resigned.” However, that was not in her role as attorney general, because when she refused to do the bidding of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, we know that she was fired. She said that directly to the Prime Minister. The new <Affiliation DbId="245292" Type="21">Attorney General</Affiliation> was given a mandate letter, and it had just three letters in it: SNC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800438"> Luckily for Canadians, the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation>'s testimony came with a clear and precise timeline. The events surrounding the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin are very clear. I would like to go over some of the key dates, for the benefit of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800439">On September 4, the director of public prosecutions informed SNC-Lavalin that the trial would go ahead and there would be no deferred prosecution agreement. At that point, anyone would need lawful authority to stop that trial.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="40">(2040)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5800440">Yesterday, the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> told us that lawful authority was not present. That began the months-long, unsolicited, coordinated and sustained attempts to stop the trial on corruption and bribery charges of that company. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800441">A few days later, the chief of staff to the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, Ben Chin, contacted the chief of staff to the then <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation>. He said that if SNC-Lavalin did not get the deferred prosecution agreement, that it would move and that it was bad news because there was an election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800442">On September 11, that same chief of staff said to the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">minister of justice</Affiliation>'s chief of staff that SNC-Lavalin was aware it was not receiving that DPA.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800443"> On September 16, Jessica Prince, the chief of staff to the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation>, received a call from Mathieu Bouchard and Elder Marques from the PMO. They told her that SNC-Lavalin made further submissions to the Crown and “there is some softening but not much.” They told her that SNC-Lavalin's board meeting was on September 20 and also mentioned the Quebec election. The former attorney general's chief of staff, Ms. Prince, told them that these concerns were bordering on interference in prosecutorial discretion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800444">As my colleague stated before, board meetings, share value, an election and a provincial election are not matters that can be considered in making a deferred prosecution agreement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800445">On September 17, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the clerk met with the then <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> to discuss the prosecution. The Prime Minister raised the issue immediately, and it was so inappropriate in the manner it was done that the former attorney general directly addressed the inappropriateness of the questions from the Prime Minister, but it did not end there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800446">On September 19, the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> met with the Clerk of the Privy Council. He brought up job losses and that SNC-Lavalin's legal counsel was not a shrinking violet. Again, it is not a matter of public interest whether its legal counsel is a shrinking violet or not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800447"> The attorney general then had to have a conversation with the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>, who wanted to browbeat her on the issue again. She told him that those engagements needed to stop, that those interventions needed to stop, and it went on and on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800448">It went on until December 19, and after a lunch between the Clerk of the Privy Council, Mr. Wernick, and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> received a phone call. The clerk said, “I think the Prime Minister is going to find a way to get it done, one way or another.” He said, “It is not good for a Prime Minister and his Attorney General to be at loggerheads.” She did not waiver. She did not allow that interference to occur. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800449">On January 7, she received a phone call from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> that she was being fired.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800450"> On January 11, the deputy minister was informed that the new <Affiliation DbId="245292" Type="21">Attorney General</Affiliation> would be dealing with one issue before any other, which was the three-letter mandate he was given: SNC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800451">Canadians are rightly concerned with what has gone on at the highest levels of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office. We, at the justice committee and in the House have asked for the Prime Minister to appear. Those requests have been met with hisses, boos and laughter from the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800452">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> must appear and when he does, he must appear under oath and give Canadians a full airing of what has occurred.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800453"> Our leader has sent a letter informing the RCMP of our concerns and we hope there is an investigation. To restore confidence in government and independence of the judiciary, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> should do the right thing and resign.

If the accused organization complies with terms and conditions set out in the agreement, the prosecutor would apply to a judge for an order of successful completion when the agreement expires. The charges would then be stayed and no criminal conviction would result. If the accused did not comply, the charges could be revived and the accused could be prosecuted and potentially convicted.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="5800488">A remediation agreement does not mean that if a company breaks the law, it will not be prosecuted. A remediation agreement is a way to ensure that it will no longer break the law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800489">SNC-Lavalin is a company that committed crimes, and it must pay for these crimes. The ones who should not pay are the thousands of people who work for the company, its retirees, clients, contractors and subcontractors, and Quebeckers, who are shareholders through the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec. Just because SNC-Lavalin broke the law does not mean that the company should be destroyed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800490">Criminals are the ones who should be punished. This means that we should prosecute the executives who broke the law. This means that the company should pay for the crimes it committed. A remediation agreement allows for this to happen, which is why many countries have this tool.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800491">I want to get back to September 2018. The Prime Minister asked the former attorney general to sign a remediation agreement, which she has the authority to do by law, but she refused to do so. Yesterday the former attorney general spoke for hours, but we still do not know why she refused. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800492"> The Prime Minister's Office told her that without a remediation agreement, SNC-Lavalin might move to London. The former attorney general responded that she would not change her mind. The Prime Minister's Office told her that this could jeopardize thousands of jobs in Quebec and Canada. She replied that she would not change her mind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800493">Every possible argument was made. She was asked whether she would like to get other expert opinions, but she said no. She was told it could cost them the upcoming election, but she said she did not care. She was told commitments had been made, but she refused to budge. She was told the head office and thousands of jobs were at stake, but it made no difference. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800494">Why did she refuse to enter into a remediation agreement, a measure she had voted for, with the company for which remediation agreements had originally been introduced? We still do not know. It is a secret. After four hours of testimony, we still do not know. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800495">As a democratic party that loves democracy, we believe in the separation of powers. We believe that the judicial and executive branches should be independent of each other. We believe that this principle must be protected at all times, without compromise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800496">Was there any undue pressure? I am still not sure. Before the Prime Minister is taken away in handcuffs, I would like to hear all sides of the story. I would like to hear more than just the former attorney general's version of the facts. I want to know the truth, plain and simple.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800497">For the moment, the truth is that thousands of jobs are at stake. The truth is that SNC-Lavalin could leave Montreal for London. The truth is that the Conservatives and the NDP would rather focus on a Liberal political scandal than on the human tragedy that would befall thousands of families if SNC-Lavalin were to leave. The truth is that the only way to save those jobs is a remediation agreement. The truth is that, if we want SNC-Lavalin to pay for its crimes, we need that remediation agreement. The truth is that there is still no such agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800498">Yesterday, we witnessed a settling of scores between the former attorney general and the Prime Minister. She did not answer the most fundamental question: why did she decide not to sign a remediation agreement, which would prevent the loss of thousands of jobs and a head office in Quebec? She had the power to do so, yet she chose not to. Why?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800499">Now, the new Attorney General needs to take responsibility. It will not be easy, but it is the right thing to do. If he does not sign an agreement, then thousands of SNC-Lavalin employees will be the victims of this settling of scores. For them, it was high time that we had an emergency debate on this issue.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800509">Mr. Speaker, my colleague shares the same opinion as the Liberal members from Quebec. In fact, we think the major issue facing the employees from Quebec and Canada as well as the pensioners, and even the suppliers and other third parties that provide goods and services and employ other workers because they have contracts with SNC-Lavalin, is to increase the value of the company. They understand that and we understand that. A logo cannot be put in prison.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800510">A logo cannot commit a crime. Only individuals can commit crimes. That is exactly the point of remediation agreements.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800524">Over the past three weeks, Parliament has focused its full attention on what everyone is now calling the SNC-Lavalin affair. However, over the past three weeks very little has actually been said about SNC-Lavalin. It would seem that no one in Parliament really cares. We only hear about the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, his entourage and the former <Affiliation DbId="214323" Type="21">attorney general of Canada.</Affiliation> That is not the heart of the matter. The heart of the matter is in Montreal and concerns the workers, who are just ordinary citizens like everyone else.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800525">Let us review the facts. Charges have been laid against SNC-Lavalin for crimes of corruption committed by former executives who have been fired. It must be pointed out that these are serious crimes and those responsible should go before a judge and pay the price for their actions. SNC-Lavalin has more than 3,600 other employees, for the most part at its Montreal head office. These 3,600 employees did not commit serious crimes and are worried about their jobs. If the company is found guilty of crimes committed by a few individuals, the head office will leave Quebec with its employees. That is the situation at SNC-Lavalin, which was founded in Quebec and is one of the 10 biggest engineering firms in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800526">Everybody knows that. The Prime Minister, the former attorney general and the opposition parties, they all know that. In light of the facts, SNC-Lavalin has to pay for the crimes of its former directors. Everybody agrees on that. No one should escape justice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800527">There are two ways to prosecute SNC-Lavalin. Both are legal and the government can use both. The first is to do nothing, allow the current process to run its course, lose the headquarters and put 3,600 people out of work with everything that entails for their families. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800528">The second is to reach a remediation agreement between the government and the company. That involves having SNC-Lavalin plead guilty, proving that it is cleaning house and paying hundreds of millions of dollars in fines. It means the company commits to being accountable and proving that it is above board at all times. If not, the charges will be re-filed in court. It means that 3,600 people in Quebec would keep their jobs and would not have to pay for the actions of their former bosses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800529">With a remediation agreement, it would be SNC-Lavalin that would be convicted, not its employees. The actual criminals would be individually taken to court. This brings us to the part of this crisis that the other parties care about, instead of caring about Quebec workers. Yesterday we heard brilliant testimony from the former attorney general. She provided a lot of detail about how the Prime Minister's Office pressured her and her staff. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> pressured her to opt for signing a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin instead of standing by while the company moved to the U.K.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800530">The Prime Minister himself asked several times for her to find a way around a trial, to prevent thousands of jobs from being lost in Montreal. I believe the former attorney general's testimony. I believe that she gave us her version of the facts and I thank her for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800531">The Prime Minister's Office was clearly doing some arm-twisting to get the former attorney general to do what it wanted. The Prime Minister acted foolishly, which is how we ended up with a full-blown crisis. The Prime Minister was obviously unable to explain the situation to her and convince her that signing an agreement was the best solution for everyone. The Prime Minister was clearly incompetent and his entourage acted like a bunch of entitled amateurs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800532">However, just because a handful of people, in this case, the Prime Minister and his entourage, act like amateurs, 3,600 others should not have to lose their jobs. Similarly, the crimes committed by a handful of individuals should not result in 3,600 people losing their jobs. The political bubble in Ottawa does not seem to get this.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="15">(2115)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5800533">That political bubble surrounds every non-Bloc MP who has forgotten that partisan jousting and news cameras are one thing and real people are another. Real people have jobs, mortgages to pay, cars, transit passes and families to support. Those are the people we are working for. Those are the people who vote for us to stand up for them. No honest person deserves to lose their job because their boss, the person in charge, the top dog, committed a crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800534">The other parties here in Ottawa have chosen to ignore that reality. They know this crisis has already cost the company $1.6 billion in the stock market. They know the company was downgraded. They know that if this company is going to survive, it will have to sell its subsidiaries at a discount and cut jobs. They know that if this goes on for much longer, there will be yet another foreign takeover of a Quebec-based company. They know all this, yet they choose the political bubble in Ottawa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800535">The reality here in the bubble is that we are in an election year, and slamming the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> looks good in the polls. The reality here is that none of the other parties are working to resolve this crisis to protect jobs. They want to drag out the crisis to make political gains at the expense of workers in Quebec. They are all playing a dangerous and cynical game, for a goal that has nothing to do with the public interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800536">The Conservative Party, which claims to be the party for the economy, is willing to sacrifice a major head office to make the Prime Minister look bad. The NDP, which claims to be the party for the workers, is willing to sacrifice 3,600 jobs to win byelections in British Columbia. The Liberal government, which currently has all the powers to act to resolve the crisis, is hiding and hoping the storm will pass. It is afraid of paying a political price in the rest of Canada, because, yes, saving jobs in Quebec or a Quebec company will cost them in the rest of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800537">Would the federalist parties bash a company based in Toronto, Calgary, or Vancouver like this? The truth is that the other parties in the rest of Canada are free to hammer on SNC-Lavalin. Let us not forget that the rest of Canada sees Quebec entrepreneurship as the Bonhomme Carnaval with a briefcase stuffed with cash, the image used by Maclean's. We know that in the rest of Canada, the only thing more popular than bashing the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is bashing Quebec, even if that means misrepresenting thousands of honest workers as white-collar criminals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800538">The Bloc Québécois unequivocally sides with the workers, and we are very proud of that. Our priority is to keep the jobs in Quebec and the headquarters in Montreal. The government has all the power it needs to intervene to come up with a remediation agreement with the company without infringing on the rule of law in any way. The Attorney General can proceed through directives or simply take over the SNC-Lavalin case. The law is crystal clear on that, and we must make use of it before the inevitable job losses begin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800539">If the opposition parties want to behave so irresponsibly, that is on them. They will have to answer for that in the election. However, the Attorney General is responsible for what happens to the SNC-Lavalin employees. He has to put partisanship aside and behave like a statesman by fulfilling the primary duty of an elected representative in Parliament, which is to protect his constituents. That is our role. That is why we are here.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800576">First, he mentioned criminality and the breaking of rules. There is no evidence from yesterday's testimony or evidence yet heard by the committee that anything unlawful or criminal occurred. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800577">The member talked about the vigorous questioning by all parties yesterday at the committee hearing as attempts to soil her character.

I think it is unfortunate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800578">Mr. Speaker, you, in an intervention, said that language is important in this debate. The member used the term “demoted” and I thought we had gotten past that.

              <ParaText id="5800579">What I would point out is that the narrative that the member seemed to weave into his comments was that there is an ethical issue.

However, until we get to the bottom of this, I think it is an open question, so I do not allege criminality in this matter. However, I think it remains a possibility and I would like to see the RCMP take over an investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800584"> I disagree with my friend, the parliamentary secretary. The Ethics Commissioner has a very narrow mandate and it certainly does not allow the Ethics Commissioner to look into things, other than a member of Parliament's personal conduct for personal reward.

The <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> said she felt that the Criminal Code had not been broken. However, I will offer that it was not broken because of her insistence and her fortitude in standing tall against this corrupt power. She is the only thing that stopped the law from being broken at that point. Again, as I mentioned earlier on, there is a constitutional law that I feel was broken on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800586">Going back to the other comment of an RCMP investigation, I absolutely believe that is something that should be done. Our hon. colleague across the way wants to deflect and make this about jobs, and pit one part of our country against another, just because we are standing up for what is right and it does not go with their narrative across the way. He knows very well that the Ethics Commissioner is lacking the investigatory teeth to look at criminality, whether it is constitutional or the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800587">We have put a letter forward. Our leader has put a letter forward to the RCMP, calling on the RCMP to do an investigation. Under subsections 139(2) and 423(1), we believe that the Criminal Code has been broken and, therefore, the RCMP should put forth an investigation immediately.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800589">This is about the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his staff politically interfering in a criminal proceeding.

              <ParaText id="5800590">The director of public prosecutions is independent for a reason. The Attorney General of Canada acts independently for a reason, because of the rule of law, because we as Canadians live in a country that is governed on the rule of law.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800603">The Clerk of the Privy Council also informed the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation>, “I think he is going to find a way”, he being the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, “to get it done, one way or another. He is in that kind of mood, and I wanted you to be aware of it.” The Prime Minister thought he did find a way. He dropped her as attorney general. He dropped her, but not before the deputy was informed by the clerk of this, “On January 11, 2019, the Friday before the shuffle, my former deputy minister was called by the Clerk and told that the shuffle was happening and that she would be getting a new minister. As part of this conversation the Clerk told the deputy that one of the first conversations the new minister will be expected to have with the Prime Minister would be on SNC Lavalin, in other words, that the new minister would be prepared to speak to the Prime Minister on this file.” </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800622">I will begin with one of the most pointed questions the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="214382" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation> asked the member for <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">Vancouver Granville</Affiliation>. Did the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> or others in the PMO break the law?

              <ParaText id="5800623">What is pressure? We are elected as parliamentarians, and some of us are privileged and tasked with also being part of cabinet. Dealing with pressure is subjective and not objective. As MPs, we are constantly pressured by constituents, stakeholders and departments. Our job is to take all things into account. Our job is to discuss them and sometimes repeat these actions again and again. We do things in balance. We take into account all the facts and then make the tough decisions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800624">Many members of Parliament will face tough challenges when a permanent resident is facing deportation, but has children born and raised in this country. They have to make the choice of letting these kids be orphaned, be without parents or be forced to go to a country where they have no home or of intervening. These are tough choices and with those choices, we will have their parents, grandparents, neighbours, family members, soccer coaches and employers pleading with us. What constitutes pressure? We as parliamentarians have to decide at the time that even though the act was bad, the person served his or her time and probably should be deported, what about those children? We have to balance that. Those are tough decisions as parliamentarians we make. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800625">This is no different for prosecutors and judges who take all the facts into consideration when they prosecute, when they judge and when they sentence.

              <ParaText id="5800627">Those members said that the justice committee would not invite the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2"> justice minister</Affiliation>, but the justice committee did. They said that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> would not waive solicitor-client privilege. The Prime Minister waived solicitor-client.

They said that there would not be enough time in committee for the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> to speak or give her the time. The chair gave so much time and gave more rounds than I have ever seen on any committee. In fact, at the end, the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">Vancouver Granville</Affiliation> finally had to say that she thought committee members had asked all their questions and were being repetitive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800628"> Then the members asked for the former principal secretary to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, Gerry Butts, to appear, and he is appearing. </ParaText>

When Harper PMO director of communications, Dimitri Soudas, was asked to come before committee, the then Conservative Harper minister, John Baird, said, “The days when you call staffers into committee to beat up staff who can't defend themselves are over.“ The Conservative House leader confirmed that he insisted on political staffers not to appear. </ParaText>

He worked for a very large multinational B.C.-based company called MacMillan Bloedel, which was very similar to SNC-Lavalin. It was an iconic B.C. company employing thousands of employees, tens of thousands at its peak. He had a good job. He worked as a lumber grader before retiring. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800633">If the executives of that company had breached laws and bribed and violated criminal codes, I would expect them to be prosecuted. I would want jail time, if necessary—period, full stop. Then if I found out that the entire company might be barred from working in Canada for 10 years, which would de facto shut it down and would even potentially have an impact on my father's pension or job, depending on the time, I would be terrified. Would I be able to go to university? Would my father be able to pay the mortgage? What would I do? </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800636">I would also not want criminal acts to occur, and I would not want those responsible to be allowed to go on. I would want them removed, fined and put behind bars. However, I would also put pressure on my elected officials. I would put a lot of pressure through letter campaigns, email campaigns. I would have meetings with elected officials, the mayor and councillors of the town the mill was in. If I found out any MP was available, I would go to them. I would go to the prime minister if I could.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800637">However, if I found out that the government would not listen, did not care or did not like pressure, I would be livid and disheartened. In fact, in the early 2000s, South Asian youth were being killed every week by gang violence. They were predominantly in south Vancouver, half of which is in the member for <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">Vancouver Granville</Affiliation>'s riding. I pleaded to my community leaders, senior police inspectors, sergeants and elected officials and asked them how we could stop this violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800638">We went to the solicitor general of British Columbia, who was Rich Coleman at the time, and we lobbied him. We annoyed him. We called him to meetings and we used the press. We did everything we could, because young kids' lives were at stake. Initially he said that his hands were tied and that the law would take its course, but the community persisted. It took more than 11 meetings and it took more than four months, but eventually the solicitor general agreed. He constituted the British Columbia Integrated Gang Task Force, which arrested and convicted dozens of people and made a major dent in the violence in south Vancouver among South Asian youth, but one thing I will tell the House is that the solicitor general never said that he felt too much pressure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800639">Currently, this problem has increased in my riding of Surrey Centre. Do members want to hear about pressure? We had 5,000 people gather in a public square. We held 80-plus meetings with mayors, councillors, principals and ministers. I went to the <Affiliation DbId="214300" Type="4">public safety minister</Affiliation> numerous times to tell him how imperative it was. He answered every time, and in fact announced $326 million to fight gun and gang violence, with $7.5 million for Surrey under the national crime prevention strategy. One thing he never said was that I put too much pressure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800640">To the NDP members, those are 10,000 union jobs. Those are people who work in British Columbia, Quebec and around the world, with over 1,000 in Ontario.

I know the hon. member was probably trying to paraphrase the question I asked yesterday at the justice committee, but the way I put it was very clear. I asked if there was a violation of the Criminal Code. I did not ask, as was reported here, if anything illegal had transpired. I agree with the interpretation of the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="213919" Type="2">Wellington—Halton Hills</Affiliation>. However, I want what I asked the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> and how she answered to be clear on the record.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800655">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak in this very important emergency debate. This is an issue that is very important to the residents of my riding of Davenport, and indeed to all Canadians. I am glad we are here this evening. It is important for every member, for every party and for anyone who wants the chance to speak to be able to do so, because we are faced with a serious situation that concerns many Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800656">I am going to start by agreeing with something that the <Affiliation DbId="229209" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> said so eloquently this morning on the radio. I agree with it completely. I believe that the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">Vancouver Granville</Affiliation> spoke her truth as she had wanted to at the justice committee yesterday. As an aside, I also want to personally very much say that I value the member of Parliament for Vancouver Granville. I value her as part of our caucus. I value her leadership on so many issues of importance to this government and I hold her in absolutely high regard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800657">Having said that, I am also in strong agreement that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> would never have applied improper pressure, that the Prime Minister has always been very aware of and very clear on the unique role of the Attorney General and would never have exerted inappropriate pressure on the former attorney general. I also very much believe our Prime Minister when he says he completely disagrees with the characterization of events as stated by the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">Vancouver Granville</Affiliation>. I wanted to state this up front so it is very clear where I stand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800658">The rest of my time will be spent speaking to our government's efforts to focus on creating well-paying jobs for our families of today and tomorrow and also on how, even through the course of all of this going on over the last few weeks, we continue to remain focused on 37 million Canadians and making their lives better and making this country better. We will never lose sight of why we are here in this venerable chamber.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800659">As our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has said, our government will always stand up for Canadian workers and the importance of the rule of law. We will focus on jobs and growing the middle class and strengthening our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800660">In fact, our platform in 2015 set out our plan to create jobs and to help Canadians get the training they need to find and keep good jobs. Since November 2015, Canada has gained over 800,000 jobs, nearly three-quarters of which are full time. We know that job numbers fluctuate in the short term, and that is why we are focused on our long-term plan for economic growth and a stronger middle class, giving Canadians the support they need to find and keep good, well-paying jobs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800661">We are also proud that we have created over 70,000 Canada summer jobs. This is an enormous accomplishment that will give our youth the best start in their careers and their work life. This has amounted to a tripling of the amount of money we have spent on Canada summer jobs in my working-class riding of Davenport since we have come into office. It means a lot to the youth, and I know it will have a big impact on their lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800662">Getting back to overall jobs, provincially the largest gains within Canada have been in Ontario, in British Columbia and also in Quebec over the last year. The three industries that saw the most growth in employment over the last year were utilities, with an 8.3% increase; transportation and warehousing, with almost 8%; and business, building and other support, with an almost 6% increase. The gains in employment were concentrated not only among youth aged 15 to 24 but also among men aged 55 and over.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800663"> Moreover, between January 2018 and January 2019, the average hourly wage among all workers increased by 2%. This is super-important in ridings like Davenport in cities like Toronto, where the cost of living continues to increase. It is really great to see that we have success in terms of increasing wages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800664">There were of course discussions about the potential loss of 9,000 jobs in communities across the country, including the possible impact on pensions, in the SNC-Lavalin affair that has been dominating the news. It is the job of any prime minister to stand up for Canadian workers, and I would say it is the job of all parliamentarians to stand up for Canadian workers, for Canadian jobs and for our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800665">In her appearance before the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> even confirmed that it is appropriate to discuss job impacts in this particular situation. There have been suggestions that this government only cares about jobs in Quebec, and this is absolutely not the case. We care about jobs right across the country, in every province and territory.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="15">(2215)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5800666">Indeed, it is important to note that SNC-Lavalin does not have offices only in Quebec. It has offices across Canada. In British Columbia, it has offices in Kelowna, Nanaimo, Nelson and Victoria. In Alberta, it has offices in Calgary, Fort McMurray, Edmonton and Grande Prairie. In Saskatchewan, it has offices in Regina and Saskatoon. In Ontario, it has offices in Sarnia, Toronto, London, Mississauga and Burlington. In Quebec, it has a number of locations: Gatineau, Laval, Longueuil, Montreal and Val-d'Or. In Newfoundland and Labrador, it has offices in Corner Brook and Mount Pearl. Finally, in Nova Scotia, it has offices in Antigonish and Halifax. The government rightly cares about any decision that impacts families, livelihoods, jobs and communities right across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800667">Let us not forget the impact of SNC-Lavalin on indirect jobs. We are not taking into consideration the many thousands of indirect jobs that are created by SNC-Lavalin in other industries that are at the heart of our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800668">Jobs matter not only as a way to ensure our livelihood but also as a way to contribute to our national tax base. This enables us to create programs like the highly successful Canada child benefit, which is the most significant public policy innovation since universal health care. It contributes to helping families with the high cost of raising their kids and to making a real difference in the lives of families in the middle class and those working hard to join it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800669">The new Canada child benefit, as we have said many times before, is simpler and tax-free, and it is targeted to income. It provides support to those who need it most. Nine in 10 Canadian families are better off under the new system, and receiving the single targeted benefit is helping to lift 300,000 children out of poverty. In addition, it helps middle-class parents buy their kids school supplies and sign them up for activities. We continue to hear from Canadians about the positive impact the Canada child benefit is having on their lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800670"> Indeed, we have been hearing great news over the last few days from Stats Canada, which shows very clearly that in fact 800,000 Canadians have been lifted out of poverty since we came into government, with almost 300,000 fewer children living below the poverty line compared to—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800676">Mr. Speaker, the health of our economy and the importance of jobs to this country is absolutely relevant to the issue at hand with respect to SNC-Lavalin. It is extremely important to understand the importance of SNC-Lavalin, how many jobs there are and what we are trying to do on the economy, which absolutely preoccupies this member and this government every single day. It is therefore important for Canadians to hear this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800677">Shifting back to why this is important for 37 million Canadians, a healthy economy is critical. Under our plan and all the initiatives our federal government has introduced, Canada is one of the best places to invest. Our corporate tax rate remains competitive. We have the lowest small business tax rate in the G7, and we have one of the strongest records of growth in the G7.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800678">In our fall economic statement, we took further action to support business investment in Canada, drive innovation and encourage businesses to create more good, well-paying jobs for the middle class.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800679">In the face of U.S. tax reforms, our government is taking action to support Canada's competitiveness and encourage businesses to create more good, well-paying jobs for the middle class. Our targeted, measured and fiscally responsible approach will support business investment in Canada; help make Canada the most globally connected economy in the world; make it easier for Canadian businesses to grow; help Canadian innovators add value, succeed and grow; and remove barriers to trade within Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800680">It is also important to note that given our government's focus on jobs, we have also taken a clear stance that unethical business practices should have no place in the Government of Canada's business dealings. We do not and we will not stand for it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800681">The fact is that corporate wrongdoing imposes significant economic and social costs. It also places barriers on our economic growth and significantly increases the cost and risk of doing business. Additionally, it undermines public and investor confidence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800682">I want to assure Canadians that protecting the integrity of our public programs and services is one of our highest priorities. We have a robust and effective integrity regime that is run by Public Services and Procurement Canada. It helps foster ethical business practices, ensures due process for suppliers and upholds public trust in our dealings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800683">By ensuring that Canadian businesses continue to compete and succeed, we are building on our proven plan to grow the economy by investing in jobs for the middle class.</ParaText>

When I arrived here in 2015, I attended the session for new members of Parliament. There were 200 of us who were new, and I was so excited, because everyone I talked to from every party said the same thing, that we were all here to work together collaboratively to make a better Canada. A better Canada is things like affordable housing, public pharmacare, affordable daycare and helping students with tuition fees. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800691">I would say to the government that if the thinking is that it is all about jobs, it is a moral hazard, because eventually, we are going to say which jobs. What signal is that sending to corporate Canada? It is saying that if they are big enough, they can do things that are wrong that contravene our international conventions, such as bribery of foreign officials and sex trafficking within this country. There is so much wrong with that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800697">We are sitting until midnight this evening for an emergency debate because Canada is caught in a very serious constitutional crisis. Never before in recent history has a barely three-week-old scandal caused such turmoil in federal politics.</ParaText>

Unfortunately, the Prime Minister of Canada, the Prime Minister of all Canadians, literally jumped with both hands and feet into partisan political interference in a legal proceeding on a criminal matter. We are here this evening to speak out against these actions that are sure to offend anyone who believes in Canadian democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800699">What Canadians heard yesterday was not just a powerful testimony but a real political and judicial atomic bomb. The former attorney general of Canada lost her job barely a month and a half ago after being subject to four months of relentless, sustained and inappropriate pressure from the highest officials in the Canadian government, namely, the Prime Minister, the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, Canada's top civil servant and others. What happened is completely unacceptable. The former attorney general gave solid, straightforward, detailed and powerful testimony. I wish the best of luck to anyone who tries to contradict the specific details of her statements. Anyone who knows their history will remember John Dean. That is what this situation reminds me of. I will talk about him a little later.</ParaText>

She said that she was the victim of inappropriate attempts to obtain a remediation agreement and the victim of thinly veiled threats.</ParaText>

In a democracy like ours, words like those have serious consequences, all the more so because they were said by people who inappropriately and constantly pressured her for four months.</ParaText>

The Prime Minister's senior adviser, Mr. Bouchard, told the former attorney general that they had to get re-elected. That is the horrible Liberal ugliness in all its wretched glory. All those people want is to be re-elected. They should be ashamed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800711">There was not just one meeting. A few days ago, I proudly stated how outrageous it was that the former attorney general had been pressured on three occasions. Now we learn that it was 10 times and that there were dozens of emails. There were 10 meetings and 10 telephone conversations where she was pressured. She also received dozens of emails from some very competent people. She nevertheless continued to uphold the law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800712">What happened? She was pressured hundreds of times by 11 people including the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister of Canada</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, the top public servant in Canada, the chiefs of staff of all these fine people and their political advisers. These are all pretty smart people. If getting pounced on by the Prime Minister of Canada, the country's top public servant and the finance minister does not amount to inappropriate pressure, I do not know what does.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800713">What is outrageous is that this happened so often in the Prime Minister's Office. If we had a real head of state as prime minister, and not a partisan leader, he would have put an end to those conversations immediately, indicating that they were in the Prime Minister's Office and not in the office of the leader of the Liberal Party, and that everyone must act correctly. However, that is not what the Prime Minister said. On the contrary, he added a partisan layer. He went on to say that he is the member for Papineau and that a provincial election was coming up in Quebec. The Prime Minister interfered, in a partisan manner, directly in the judicial process and in a criminal case. That is why we are calling for him to resign. What he did was unacceptable. He has disgraced the highest public office in this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800714">I hear the Liberals saying they want to protect jobs, but there is a procedure for doing so, and they did not follow it. There are steps to follow and consultations and conversations to be had at the right time. Once the decision is taken, it is too late. Still, they continued to apply political pressure after the decision was taken. That is even worse. The decision was taken on September 4, and that is when the pressure began and it lasted until December.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800715">I often hear people say that we have to think about the jobs. No one here wants people to lose their job. However, neither does anyone, not in Quebec or Canada, want these jobs to be protected illegally. There is a way of doing things, but the Liberal Party did their own thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800716">When we talk about jobs I, am reminded of my time at the National Assembly of Quebec nine years ago. I was leader of the Action démocratique at the time. Along with colleagues like the late Sylvie Roy, current Minister Bonnardel, current Minister Caire, Marc Picard, Janvier Grondin, and others, we were the first to call for an inquiry into the construction industry. Some very high-ranking people called me to tell me to be careful because there were jobs at play and companies could go bankrupt over what I was calling for. However, we stood our ground because it is more important to do the right thing than to engage in partisan politics. Sadly, this government chose the latter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800717">That is why this evening we are strongly condemning the Prime Minister's partisan actions as he interfered in the judicial process and in a criminal case just to get re-elected.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5800742">Mr. Speaker, on February 12, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said he was “surprised and disappointed” in the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> for resigning from cabinet. He also said, “The government of Canada did its job and to the clear public standards expected of it. If anybody felt differently, they had an obligation to raise that with me. No one, including [the former attorney general, whom he called by her first name], did that.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800743">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> also publicly said, “At no time did I or my office direct the current or previous attorney general to make any particular decision in this matter.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800744"> However, that stands in stark contrast to the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation>'s testimony at the justice committee yesterday. She said, “For a period of approximately four months, between September and December of 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the Attorney General of Canada”. She said, “These events involved 11 people...from the Prime Minister's Office, the Privy Council Office and the office of the Minister of Finance.” She said there were “in-person conversations, telephone calls, emails and text messages”, and “approximately 10 phone calls and 10 meetings specifically about SNC” that she and her staff were a part of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800745">The timing is important. On September 4, the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> was informed by the head of the arm's-length director of public prosecutions that the public prosecutor had decided to proceed with criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800746">On September 17, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> brought up SNC Lavalin with the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation>. He admits this. She says she stated directly to him, “I had done my due diligence and had made up my mind on SNC and...I was not going to interfere with the decision of the director.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800747">She said that in response, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> outlined concerns about the potential of SNC-Lavalin moving out of Canada if a prosecution proceeded, and that she was surprised when the Clerk of the Privy Council then started to make the case for a deferred prosecution agreement instead, which would require her to change her mind and interfere.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800748">Here is where the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> exposed the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s real motivation. She said the clerk pointed out, “There is a board meeting on Thursday, September 20th, with stockholders,” and that “there is an election in Quebec soon”. She said, “At that point the Prime Minister jumped in, stressing that there is an election in Quebec and that 'I am an MP in Quebec, the member for Papineau.'”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800749"> The Liberals keep claiming that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s concerted pressure was a concern for jobs, but let us be real about what this is actually all about. It is that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> will always put his political power and Liberal partisan interests ahead of principle, ahead of doing what is right and even, as we now all know, ahead of upholding the rule of law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800750">While hundreds of thousands of oil and gas workers across Canada, Albertans, auto workers in Oshawa and others, can be forgiven for asking why the heck he does not care about their jobs, his pressure on the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> was not really about jobs in Quebec either. It was about his job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800751">Clearly, talking about the Quebec election and connecting his rationale to his riding, shows it is all about politics and power. I am pretty sure Quebeckers do not really want the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to use them and their jobs and their livelihoods as an excuse for his inappropriate behaviour and his lack of a moral compass, or as a spin tool for the crisis he has created either.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800752">However, his political considerations were repeatedly put to the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation>. The desk-book of the director of public prosecutions specifically excludes “possible political advantage or disadvantage to the government or any political group or party” as a deciding factor.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800753">The former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> said that when she asked the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> directly whether he was politically interfering with her, he said, “No, no, no, we just need to find a solution.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800754">Two weeks after the decision was made by the arm's-length public prosecutor, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> told the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> that she needed to “find a solution”. What exactly is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s definition of direction if it is not telling his former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation>, after she explicitly told him she was not going to interfere, that she still needed to “find a solution”?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800755">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and all the Liberals acknowledge the pressure. They call it that themselves, and they do not dispute her accounts of these multiple meetings and calls and messages from multiple people. In fact, they all say it is normal, but the problem is that all those attempts are the violation. That is why all Canadians should be seized with the gravity of this unacceptable situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800756">The Criminal Code says that everyone who wilfully attempts in any manner “to obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice is guilty”. It goes on to say that it is a crime to engage in any conduct with the intent to provoke “a state of fear” in “a justice system participant in order to impede him or her in the performance of his or her duties”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800757">While the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> is clearly made of extraordinary mettle, she referenced her understandably high level of anxiety in the escalating barrage and veiled threats from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and powerful staff and the Clerk of the Privy Council, who all refused to take her no for an answer and repeatedly pushed her to reverse her own decision and to interfere with the public prosecutor.</ParaText>

Over weeks, they suggested there were multiple versions of the truth. They blamed her, saying it was her perception, and she should have acted or said something differently.

              <ParaText id="5800759">Even today, a Liberal MP said the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation>'s concerns were from “a lack of experience”.

              <ParaText id="5800763">This whole awful spectacle is a pattern of saying one thing and doing another, of putting rich powerful cronies ahead of everyone else, of refusing to take personal responsibility and blaming others, of patronizing and attacking anyone who dares to question or disagree with them, of one standard for them and their fellow elites, and another for everyone else.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800764">It is a culture set by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and it is pervasive.

              <ParaText id="5800768">The <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> says the Clerk of the Privy Council told her, “I think he [the Prime Minister] is going to find a way to get it done, one way or another.

You're bound by cabinet secrecy and cabinet solidarity, but as Attorney General you have to speak, to use her words, 'truth to power', and it may contradict with what some of the other ministers might feel. They then speak to you out of their political hats, but they don't always realize when they speak to you that you are wearing not only a political hat but that you are wearing also a legal hat. When it comes, as in the matter of prosecutions, there is another dimension of independence and the rule of law all bound up, so there are these psychological dynamics and you can have a situation where the people whom she spoke with, each of them may have felt that when they were speaking to her they were giving her information that they felt was important for her to know or to help her make up her mind. Yet when she experienced it coming from 10 different people, then she experienced it as being a concerted and sustained pressure, which she deemed to be inappropriate. So they may have felt they were acting in a proper manner from the point of view of intention, but the consequence ended up being felt by her as being inappropriate.” </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800790">Under the Department of Justice Act, the Minister of Justice is also the Attorney General of Canada. The two positions are distinct, even though they are held by the same person. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800791">As the holder of both positions, the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada has four main roles. First, the minister is the official legal adviser to the Government of Canada. Second, the minister is responsible for laws and policies relating to the justice portfolio. Third, the minister represents the Crown in all civil litigation. Fourth, the minister is the attorney general for all federal prosecutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800792">The Minister of Justice is the official legal adviser to the Governor General and the legal expert in cabinet. As such, the minister of justice is responsible for ensuring that the administration of justice under federal jurisdiction is in accordance with the law. As Attorney General, that same minister is responsible for advising the heads of the several departments of the government on all matters of law connected with the departments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800793">Legal advice is always given independently. The legal advice of the Minister of Justice and Attorney General is based solely on the law, doctrine and applicable jurisprudence. The principles of law are the only relevant considerations when providing legal advice. That is part of the unique experience of the minister's mandate and of the department supporting him or her. Although the constitution of the client departments, agencies and sometimes other departments may be required to establish the facts, the context and underlying political objectives of the request for advice and the legal advice itself must be provided without partisan or political influence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800794">The Minister of Justice is also responsible for laws and policies relating to the justice portfolio. Like other ministers, when the justice minister creates a policy, he or she works closely with certain cabinet colleagues or the Privy Council Office to ensure that these initiatives are aligned with the government's legislative agenda. In accordance with the Department of Justice Act, the Attorney General of Canada is responsible for any litigation involving the Crown or the departments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800795">In the conduct of civil litigation, the Attorney General does not have exclusive decision-making power over litigation positions. In civil litigation, sifting through the available and viable legal arguments to determine the position to take in a given case often involves a high level of policy. In that sense, civil litigation is markedly different from criminal litigation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800796">The entire government is elected to determine what is in the public interest. The Attorney General is responsible for defending cabinet's public policy decisions before the civil courts, thereby helping the government to meet the objectives it was elected on. Provided these decisions seek to adopt a valid legal position, it is appropriate for the Attorney General to adopt such a position. If not, this could be perceived as a lack of solidarity with cabinet, an important aspect of the constitutional convention of collective ministerial responsibility to Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800797">However, as far as his role in prosecutions is concerned, the Attorney General must act independently, not taking any orders from anyone, as an attorney general in England declared in 1925. More precisely, the Attorney General must act independently of partisan considerations. The Supreme Court determined that this was a fundamental constitutional principle of our democratic government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800798"> Identifying those who need to be prosecuted for crimes and determining sentences should be based on evidence alone and on the proper administration of criminal law. However, it is advisable for the Attorney General to be informed of the relevant context. Let me repeat that because it is important: it is advisable for the Attorney General to be informed of the relevant context, including the potential consequences of a given prosecution. This may give rise to a need to discuss matters with colleagues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800799">In 2006, the Director of Public Prosecutions Act created an independent entity known as the Public Prosecution Service of Canada. The act enshrined the role of the Attorney General in federal prosecutions by giving the director of public prosecutions the power to initiate and conduct prosecutions. The director acts as the deputy attorney general of Canada when initiating and conducting federal prosecutions on behalf of the Attorney General.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="00">(2300)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5800800">In most cases, the Attorney General will not be involved in the decision-making process with respect to prosecution. However, the Director of Public Prosecutions Act requires the director to inform the Attorney General of any prosecution that raises important questions of general interest. The act therefore guarantees that the Attorney General will be informed of any important criminal matters, and nothing prevents the Attorney General from discussing them with his or her cabinet colleagues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800801"> The Attorney General can issue directives to the director of public prosecutions that may be general or pertain to specific prosecutions. When a directive is issued, it is issued through a totally transparent process. It is published in the Canada Gazette and accessible to all Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800802">As an aside, I would like to thank the public servants who work for the Canada Gazette. It is an important institution that has existed for 178 years. During my many years as a federal public servant, I had the good fortune of heading up the Canada Gazette for a few years. I am particularly proud of all the public servants who work there and who ensure that that institution remains vibrant and crucial to our democratic system.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800805">A general directive must be preceded by a consultation with the director of public prosecutions. The Attorney General may, after consulting the director of public prosecutions, assume conduct of the prosecution. This is also done through a transparent process in which the Attorney General must publish a notice of intent to assume conduct of a prosecution in the Canada Gazette.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800806">As far as obtaining comments from other individuals in the exercise of his or her power to issue directives or assume conduct of a prosecution under the Director of Public Prosecutions Act, it is appropriate for the Attorney General to consult his or her cabinet colleagues before exercising these powers. These consultations are often important, because they help the Attorney General understand points of view that are not limited to a specific case. However, the final decision to issue directives or assume conduct of a prosecution is up to the Attorney General. In any case, it is important that the Attorney General be able to consult his or her cabinet colleagues on matters related to prosecution, but that he or she not receive instructions on criminal matters from cabinet colleagues or anyone else.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800807">The Supreme Court found that, in the course of his or her duties, the Attorney General acts in the public interest and is protected from the influence of political and other undue aggravating factors by the principle of independence. From the beginning, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has clearly stated that he and his staff always acted appropriately and professionally.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5800826">Mr. Speaker, I want to start by paying my respect to the member for <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">Vancouver Granville</Affiliation>. She is a colleague, a friend and someone whose principles I admire and whose determination to do the right thing we all can respect. We saw that on display yesterday. We have certainly seen it inside caucus for the time we have been in government and worked together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800827"> It is important that in this process she be respected. She has fulfilled her duties and done them well. While the member for <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">Vancouver Granville</Affiliation> may have some new converts on the other side, those of us who have worked with her have known she has these principles and she has acted on principle throughout this entire situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800828">I also want to note that we are discussing a matter which is in front of the courts still. SNC-Lavalin has been brought to court, as the public record shows, on some very serious charges. It is proper that those charges be adjudicated through the process in which it currently finds itself. It is important to note that those criminal proceedings are still happening. We often hear from the other side that somehow something has been suspended or something untoward has happened, but the reality is that the company is being held to account for practices for which it will have to answer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800829">When it comes to deferred prosecution agreements, the law that governs the use of these agreements is very clear. They are there to ensure that for people unassociated with the charges, damage is not done to them accidentally through a verdict and sentencing and that people are protected. It is important to protect people in the justice system, especially innocent people. The lives of thousands of people could be impacted by whatever decision is rendered in that court.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800830">As part of the legal framework that governs the way in which courts have to respond to these charges, there is provision for the minister to intervene, once the public prosecution office has rendered a path forward. That is permissible under our laws, and we have had many members here stand today and talk about when and how that aspect of the law should be applied.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800831">It is there because there other considerations. Responsible governments have to balance impacts at times. It is not that the Constitution and jobs are at conflict. It is that both have to be held with equal weight and in their proper place as the government moves forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800832"> Therefore, when we look at these cases, the other thing we know is that as the evidence is put on the record, as discovery is pursued, as lawyers talk, it is a fluid process. As we heard yesterday in the testimony from the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation>, even the lead prosecutor and the chief prosecutor all the way through this process were talking about what was the right course of action, based on evidence and offers from the other side. It is not a simple sequential thing where, once the chief prosecutor makes a decision, everything just falls into order. There are negotiations. There are conversations. There are moments in court. These things happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800833">At the same time, the impact of a decision can also be measured differently as circumstances change around the case, as shareholder meetings are held, as economic conditions and other court cases are rendered, as the health and strength of economies ebb and flow, as contracts are let and, in this case, as new infrastructure programs move forward. Therefore, it is not unusual for lawyers to talk back and forth. Nor is it unusual for government officials to talk back and forth about what the implications and the circumstances are and what the possible outcomes might be and the impact that they might have on Canadians. We have a responsibility to the Constitution and we have a responsibility to the law, but we also have a responsibility to ensure that the lives of Canadians are kept safe, especially the lives of innocent Canadian hat could be impacted by a court decision like this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800834">Therefore, there is no final decision in this process. There is a series of evaluations that have to happen and those evaluations are right and proper, provided they are done within the framework of the law that governs deferred prosecution agreements.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="15">(2315)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5800835">It is not wrong for a government to be concerned about people's lives, about pensioners and the impact a decision might have on the viability of their pensions, and about municipalities that have contracted with the company involved and whether the projects they are involved in may stall, such as a water plant or, as we have in the case of Ottawa, an LRT that is being built. The people on those job sites also have a right to make sure that their innocence is protected through the decisions and impacts this government has carriage of, and the government does have carriage of it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800836">When we look at that, and we heard from some members from Quebec who were very eloquent about this, we have a responsibility to measure outcomes, to predict possibilities, to explore various outcomes and to make sure that the proceedings are kept within the boundaries of the law but at the same time are measured and thoughtful. That requires, from time to time, checking in with the Minister of Justice. It also requires the Minister of Justice checking in from time to time with cabinet colleagues, caucus colleagues and I would say members of Parliament. I do not think that is unexpected, unwarranted or wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800837">The issue then becomes how we balance this within the law. I think some of the members opposite have contributed to the debate and have deepened our understanding. I look to the member for <Affiliation DbId="213919" Type="2">Wellington—Halton Hills</Affiliation>, who has had very reasonable and well-articulated arguments presented on the floor. The member for <Affiliation DbId="214382" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation> has done the same, as has our esteemed colleague from <Affiliation DbId="214384" Type="2">Victoria</Affiliation>. We are being tested to make sure that we are doing the right thing in the right way, in the same way that the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former justice minister</Affiliation> assured us that she was trying to do the right thing in the right way. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800838">Through all of this, the issue that now has been presented to us by the opposition is whether the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> should resign. Of course, he should not, because he too is doing his job. He is making sure that every outcome, every possibility and every impact is understood and that all decisions are being made in a fluid situation, in a very dynamic situation. That is what I expect of a prime minister in a country like Canada. I also expect those decisions to be tested by the opposition. They have been tonight and probably will be for days to come. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800839">However, in the end, the issue that I think defines this is the fact that the court case continues. Even if a deferred prosecution agreement is offered or materializes, if that is the decision of an independent prosecution office not directed by our government, because that is still an option for an independent prosecution office to make if that is the best way forward in its independent judgment, it is not a get-out-of-jail card for SNC-Lavalin. For an agreement to be entered into, there is still an acknowledgement of guilt. Otherwise, it cannot move forward. There are still punishments afforded that acknowledgement that must be lived up to. Otherwise, the deferred prosecution is no longer deferred and it is re-engaged. In other words, the criminal charge hangs over the accused company until such time as proper penalties have been paid, penalties that do not impact innocent Canadians, do not rob them of their jobs, take away pensions, collapse critical infrastructure, hurt communities or disrupt good, strong investments that have been made right across this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800840">The issue that stands at the heart of this conversation is how we respect the law, how we balance the interests of innocent Canadians and protect them and how we are held to account by Parliament while we do that. I am confident that the government has done the right thing, that the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> has done the right thing and that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has done the right thing. I agree that the opposition is doing its job holding us to account and making us explain the circumstances we find ourselves in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800841">The final point I will make is this. The former attorney general has done what she was asked to do, which was to make the decision she had to make and come to committee to be held accountable for it and explain it. This Parliament and this government are now in a position to figure out what the next steps are. I am prepared to be held to account as a member of this government, but I am also prepared to stand in support of my <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800842">Mr. Speaker, I have two points I would like to make. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800843">The first is that while the pressure that was applied to the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> this past autumn may have not crossed the line of the Criminal Code as she has indicated, it certainly is clear that it crossed a line of a much higher order and that is the line as it is embodied in our constitutional law, both written in the Constitution Acts of this country and the constitutional law as it is outlined in the unwritten conventions that govern the division of powers and the rule of law in this country. It is clear that this higher law was contravened over the course of the autumn as this relentless, sustained and prolonged pressure was put on the former attorney general.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800844">The second quick point I want to make is that we in the House, on all sides, care about Canadian companies and care about Canadian jobs whether they are in Quebec or in Alberta. That is not the issue here at hand. The issue here at hand concerns the fundamental constitutional principles that govern this country. If we diminish those principles like the rule of law, we also diminish the other principles and conventions in the Constitution, principles that protect minorities in this country, principles that protect the French fact in this country, principles that protect French language minority rights in the rest of Canada and the rights of Francophones in the province of Quebec. That is why the issue in front of us is so serious and so great.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800845">Mr. Speaker, I respect the argument that the member opposite is presenting but I disagree with two parts of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800846">The first is the characterization of the conversations and the exchanges between members of this government and the <Affiliation DbId="214323" Type="21">former attorney general</Affiliation>. Those characterizations, not necessarily in his speech but across the night tonight, have been exaggerated to extraordinary lengths. They are not the way she described them. They are the way the member's party has described them and they are different. Because they are different, I do not share them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800847">The second one is that the member opposite has offered an opinion and it is an important subject that he is offering an opinion on, but it is his opinion of the legal circumstances in this situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800848">A member was speaking to me once about our caucus and the fact that we have 45 lawyers in our caucus who suddenly upon getting elected as MPs all became constitutional lawyers and experts in the Constitution. I appreciate that most lawyers are given that course in law school but the reality is that a legal opinion is a legal opinion. It is not a finding of fact. You may have come to a conclusion but that does not mean it is the right conclusion.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5800851">Mr. Speaker, I did listen attentively to the hon. member's speech. The main crux of his argument I think it would be fair to say is that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has a responsibility to look out for Canadian jobs. That is fair enough. I do not think anybody would dispute that the Prime Minister of Canada should be concerned about Canadian jobs but there are also other important principles at play, even in the legislation that lays out the possibility of establishing deferred prosecution agreements of the type that someone suggested SNC-Lavalin should get.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800852">The legislation has a section “Factors not to consider” and that section reads:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800853">
                <Quote>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800854">Beyond that, it is up to the independent prosecutor to make that decision. The prosecutor made that determination. The <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> was clear that she had made a decision not to interfere with that, and the Prime Minister and his officials continued to pressure her to reverse that decision. That is the problem here and it goes beyond the Prime Minister's responsibility to be a defender of Canadian jobs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800855">Mr. Speaker, I was very clear that the considerations were innocent people and the consideration of those innocent people is a primary responsibility of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800856">I also was, I hope, clear in saying that while there was a constant conversation, a series of conversations, 10 in person and 10 by email, about reconsidering, rethinking, getting different legal opinions and making sure that all of the information that was possibly there was there to be considered.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5800858">Mr. Speaker, we are here tonight to talk about a serious charge made by the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general </Affiliation>at committee yesterday. At committee she said, “For a period of approximately four months, between September and December of 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the Attorney General of Canada in an inappropriate effort to secure a deferred prosecution agreement with SNC-Lavalin.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800859">It is a pretty serious charge. At the heart of the charge is a company that employs many people—and we are grateful for good jobs in Canada—but that is not a free pass to do whatever the company would like. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800860">This is a company whose boardroom has a checkered past. For instance, SNC-Lavalin has been banned by the World Bank from bidding on contracts for 10 years, after investigations revealed that it undertook bribery schemes in Bangladesh and Cambodia. As well, a former SNC-Lavalin executive recently pleaded guilty to breaking election laws to funnel tens of thousands of dollars into the coffers of both the Liberal and Conservative parties. It is a company that in 2011 was able to buy Atomic Energy of Canada's commercial operations for only $15 million, including the plans to the CANDU reactor, and at the same time got a guarantee of $75 million worth of contracts for the work, which more than pays for the price it paid for an important Canadian asset, the plans for the CANDU reactor. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800861">Currently, SNC is part of a consortium that stands to benefit from a multi-billion-dollar capital project right here in downtown Ottawa, with the privatization of the operations of the heating and cooling plant that serves many buildings downtown, including the very building we are in right now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800862">Now we hear of political interference by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> on that company's behalf—not for the workers, but to help SNC-Lavalin executives escape these criminal charges. I will have more to say on that further on in my remarks. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800863">In response to the testimony we heard from the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> that there was a sustained effort to pressure her inappropriately into changing her position, the NDP has called for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to waive cabinet confidence for the period after she was fired from the position of Attorney General but was still in cabinet, because that was not waived and she was very clear at committee that there are elements to the story that bear on her ultimate decision to resign from cabinet that she is not able to tell because they continue to be covered under those confidences. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800864">We have also asked that the justice committee hear from the 11 people the MP for <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">Vancouver Granville</Affiliation> named as part of the pressure campaign, who include the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. Certainly he has details about what went on that Canadians would like to know and that are essential to being able to understand the nature of what transpired, so he ought to appear before committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800865">We also called for a full public inquiry when the story broke some time ago, and we renewed our call because there are a lot of moving parts to this story. I do not think that comes as a surprise to anyone here. It seems there are new revelations almost every day. The scope of the current investigations is simply not adequate for the task of understanding the entirety of what is going on. Each investigation may bear important fruit in terms of figuring out a piece of the puzzle, but by no means can any one of the existing investigations tell the whole story. That is why it is important that we have a public inquiry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800866">Why is it important to get to the bottom of this? Anyone who has ever been pressured or bullied into doing something they thought was a bad idea probably has a sense of what is wrong with this picture, and anyone who has been pressured or bullied by someone in a position of authority over them will have an even better idea. Perhaps it is a supervisor at work who can terminate someone's position and take away their salary or a landlord who governs whether or not one someone can stay in an apartment unit. It could be a parole officer or a team coach. These are people someone in positions of authority. By and large, people who occupy those positions do a good job and are leaders in our community, but when people in those kinds of positions decide to abuse that power and authority, it is an awful feeling to be subject to it. It is ugly and it is wrong. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="30">(2330)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5800867">The allegation is that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, his principal secretary, his chief of staff and the Clerk of the Privy Council, who all have a lot of authority and power, did just such a thing. According to the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation>, as I said, they used that power to inappropriately pressure her to reverse a decision of the director of public prosecutions in order to get a corporation charged with bribery of public officials out of facing criminal charges. The Prime Minister wants to chalk that up to a difference in perspectives and he wants to put his word up against hers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800868">However, I think anyone who watched the testimony yesterday would have seen that the member for <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">Vancouver Granville</Affiliation> offered a calm, consistent, well-documented testimony and she embodied everything one would expect in a credible witness. I believe her testimony, and I encourage any Canadians listening at home to watch it for themselves if they have any doubt. While she and I disagree on a number of policy matters, and we have had disagreements in the House, I do respect her integrity. She has set an example for us all in the way she has conducted herself in a very difficult situation, and that example stands for all of us, whatever our political stripe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800869">The former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> was taking decisions that were hers to take. It was a decision not of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> but of the former attorney general whether to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement. When she said that she had made up her mind, the decision was taken. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800870">It was not inappropriate initially for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to have some conversation with her about the economic impact of these things. That is part of good policy-making and good decision-making, frankly. However, when she said that she had considered those things and had made up her mind, that ought to have been the end of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800871"> However, we did not hear in her testimony that when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and various officials at the top levels of government kept coming back at her and her staff to try to convince them to change this decision, that they were presenting any new information. Perhaps if the Prime Minister would like to come to committee and testify, then he could tell us what new information he was offering her, but that is not what we have heard. We have heard that they were coming with similar arguments and veiled threats to get her to change her mind. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800872">She stood up to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his team for the sake of an important principle, which is the rule of law. Why is that important? The rule of law gives us rights. It is what protects us from egomaniacs and bullies that sometimes make it into positions of power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800873"> As Canadians, we are entitled to a fair hearing and equal treatment before the law. We can contrast that with other places in the world today or in times past where people live or lived in fear of the whims of people at the top. We passed laws over time to build a system that protected Canadians from that kind of arbitrary treatment, but there is no law we can pass that can guarantee that forever. Protecting our rights, just like protecting our democracy, is a job that is never done and it is why moments like this are so important. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800874">The rule of law and democracy also have an important cultural component. We have to build a culture of respect for rules and due process in our institutions if we want to safeguard democracy and the rule of law. The higher up the food chain one goes, the more power one has, the more important it is for democracy and the rule of law that one conducts oneself according to the highest ethical standard and in respect of those rules. The member for <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">Vancouver Granville</Affiliation> lived up to her duty in that regard, but based on her testimony yesterday, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his team fell far short of that mark.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800875">On December 5, in a meeting with the former PMO principal secretary, Gerry Butts, he is alleged by the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> to have talked to her chief of staff about how the statute was set up by Harper and that he did not like the law, as if that were relevant. In a December 18 meeting, Gerry Butts and the PMO chief of staff, Katie Telford, told Jessica Prince in the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation>'s office that a resolution to the DPA situation was necessary. He stated, “Jess, there is no solution here that does not involve some interference.” Telford stated, “We don't want to debate legalities anymore.” That is from the member for <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">Vancouver Granville</Affiliation>'s testimony yesterday. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800876">In a December 19 phone call between the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> and the Clerk of the Privy Council, the Clerk stated that “I think he”, the Prime Minister, “is going to find a way to get it done, one way or another. He is in that kind of mood, and I wanted you to be aware of it.” He also told the former attorney general that she did not want to be on a collision course with the Prime Minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800877">For some reason, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> felt that he could override the independence of the attorney general. Perhaps that should not come as a surprise. He was, after all, the first Canadian prime minister to be found guilty of ethics violations by the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800878">What about when KPMG ran into trouble? The Liberals were willing to cut a secret deal when KPMG was found to have devised a tax-dodging scheme. All KPMG had to was pay the taxes it owed, without penalties. It got amnesty, and there was secrecy around most of the terms of its settlement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800879">This is the government that made a science out of cash-for-access fundraising, which has a whole world of ethical problems in and of itself, and it is something we have to watch out for, because a culture of entitlement like this can easily slip into habits of corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800880">That is why it is important to be vigilant. It is also why it is important to get to the bottom of what happened. It is why it is so important that the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation> be able to tell her full story. It is why it is important that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> waive the rules of cabinet confidence not only for the period when she was the Attorney General, which has been done, but also for the period when she was the veterans affairs minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800881">She made it clear in her testimony that there are things she cannot say about her ultimate decision to resign from cabinet because of something, presumably, like a conversation or something else, that happened between the time she took the job as veterans affairs minister and the time she resigned from cabinet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800882">It is also why it is so important that we have a full public inquiry and get to the bottom of what happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800883">Having established the importance of the issue, I want to take some time to address some of the arguments I have heard from Liberal members in the chamber today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800884">They have said that the opposition should not be concerned about this because an investigation is happening at the justice committee. I respect that the justice committee has a job to do. However, I believe the scope of the study it has selected is already too narrow to capture everything that is going on. Within the scope of the study the committee selected, we will not get to the bottom of all the allegations that have come out from the testimony.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800885">As well, it needs to be said that there is a fundamental political conflict of interest in leaving that investigation to a committee that is dominated by Liberals, who have a clear political interest in ensuring that the problem goes away so that it does not ultimately hurt the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. The fact that so many Liberals seem to be blind to that fact or do not really see a problem with that or understand why people would have legitimate concerns about the justice committee being the principal forum for getting to the bottom of this is very telling in terms of how the government got into this kind of trouble in the first place. Liberals do not seem able to identify these kinds of obvious, or at the very least apparent, conflicts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800886">When we pursue the highest ethical standards, as the Prime Minister told his ministers in his mandate letters he wanted to do and as he told Canadians he wanted to do in the 2015 election, apparent conflicts of interest are just as important as actual conflicts of interest. There is certainly an apparent conflict of interest when six Liberal members of Parliament are going to be the final adjudicators on what has happened in this case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800887">The Liberals have also said that since the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner is running an investigation, we should not be concerned. They say we should not have any extra questions, as he is going to decide everything. We are quite aware of that. In fact, it was the NDP Party that requested that investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800888">It is not that we do not have confidence in the commissioner and therefore want a public inquiry and it is not that we do not think there is some value to the investigation that is going on; it is that the commissioner's investigation is also limited in scope. It is limited by the very rules that set up the office of the commissioner and gave him his powers and responsibilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800889">As such, there is no way his report is going to get to the bottom of all of what we have heard. These allegations of political interference fall outside the narrow scope given to the Conflict of Interest Commissioner, who only looks into conflicts of interest as they pertain to the direct financial interests of a member of the House. We will be interested to hear the conclusion of his investigation, but there is certainly a lot more going on here than that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800890">The Liberals also say that another reason we should not worry is that the director of public prosecutions has said that she made an independent decision. No one has ever doubted that she made an independent decision. The problem was not that somehow her decision was not independent; the problem was that after that decision was made, political actors, including the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and those in his office, sought to reverse that decision. Furthermore, they did not just do it with a one-off conversation with the <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">former attorney general</Affiliation>. They coordinated a pressure campaign in order to try to reverse that decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800891">That is the problem. Let us not see anyone get up to say that the director of public prosecutions made her decision independently. Of course she did. The question is whether someone else sought to overturn that decision for political reasons.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="40">(2340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5800892">I have heard the Liberals stand up today and say that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> told the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> that it was her decision at the time, so there is nothing to see here and not to worry. I do not doubt that he did. That is a pretty good way to cover his behind. I can believe that she even took him at his word at the time, which is what she said in testimony. When she was fired from the position, that probably changed her point of view about the conversation they had when she was told that it was really her decision and hers alone. When she made the decision the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> clearly did not want, she lost the job. That cast a whole new light on the conversations they had had up to then, which she reasonably may have thought were sincere.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800893">We have also been told that we should be quiet, because the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> gave her a waiver on solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidentiality. The thing that leaves out is the fact that the waiver on cabinet confidentiality does not cover the period when she was in cabinet between the time she was fired from her job as attorney general and took the job as the veterans affairs minister and when she chose to resign. She was very clear at committee that there are aspects of the story she is unable to tell. Presumably something happened in that period that made her change her mind. If we are going to get to the bottom of this, we need to know exactly what that was.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800894">My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="214384" Type="2">Victoria</Affiliation> presented a motion yesterday at committee simply asking that the justice committee request of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> that cabinet confidentiality be waived. It does not have any power to compel the Prime Minister to waive it. I watched as each Liberal member of that committee voted the motion down and refused to at least ask the Prime Minister to take it upon himself to liberate the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> to tell her full story.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800895">I know I only have a few minutes left. I want to talk about the principal argument we have heard in this place in terms of the Liberals' defence, which is jobs, jobs, jobs and that they want to save the jobs. Everyone here has an interest in seeing Canadian employed, but that does not mean anything goes. It cannot be a get-out-of-jail-free card. It cannot be that if a company is big enough and employs enough people, it can bribe public officials and get off the hook. That is completely inappropriate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800896">Was it about the workers? Was it about the jobs? When we heard from the former <Affiliation DbId="214558" Type="2">attorney general</Affiliation> that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was raising political concerns about the fact that he was the MP for <Affiliation DbId="214115" Type="2">Papineau</Affiliation> and there was a Quebec election and something had to be done about this, it was not about the workers or their jobs. It was about the political interests of the Prime Minister and the Liberal Party. That is what it was about, and it had very little to do with the workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800897">What could have been an option, which is something the Liberals are also pursuing, was reforming the integrity regime with the 10-year ban on contracts. In fact, it is an option they are pursuing. I dare say that this is the appropriate option, not looking at inappropriate pressure to abandon criminal charges but looking at the sanctions regime and maybe changing it. That is where the conversation should have happened. They have prejudiced and sullied that conversation, because no matter what they do now, it is going to look like they are exercising all the options and pulling out all the stops to help get SNC-Lavalin off the hook.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800898">The <Affiliation DbId="233810" Type="4">Minister of Public Services and Procurement</Affiliation> was at committee yesterday. I asked her a simple question many times. I asked if she would say that the bribery of public officials is a serious offence and would be treated as a serious offence in the new integrity policy. She told me that the government does not have a position on the hierarchy of offences. That is what she said. As the minister who oversees the largest capital budget in government, she refused to say that she thought the bribery of public officials was a serious offence. I could not believe it. It is a testament to how deep the desire to help out this company goes in the government and how fearful people on the other benches are of doing anything that could undermine the interests of that company. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800899">I hope I get a chance in questions and answers to talk a bit more about workers and the record of the government when it comes to workers. One of the first bills I saw passed in this place was Bill <Document DbId="8139986" Type="3">C-10</Document>, which was under time allocation and everything else. That was a bill to change the law to allow Air Canada to outsource its maintenance work for the aerospace industry out of the country. I have a few more examples, so hopefully I will have a chance to address them in questions and answers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800901">I also categorically reject this phrase “get out of jail free”. A deferred prosecution agreement does not suspend a criminal charge.

It is tantamount to a plea bargaining situation in a court, except that the difference here is that the charges are not discharged. They stay on the record. Every single one of the punishments that the party must submit to and admit to because of its guilt is part of the process.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800904">That is why the integrity regime was brought in.

It was a decision to try to get serious about this kind of stuff, which we have to do if we want Canadian corporations to go out in the world and conduct business in the way that I think all Canadians expect and in a way that does not put the jobs and lives of the workers on the line.</ParaText>

I went down to the justice committee room because I was interested, and in part because I wanted to get a feel for the credibility of the witness. I have to say I was impressed, not just with her delivery but this is a person who is citing text messages and other documentation, who took copious notes, who is not flying by the seat of her pants on this, at all, but acting as we would expect of a professional of her calibre.

There was no effort at all to try to give Canadians any idea as to what was different about those events, such that we would prefer his account. In fact, we really do not have an account of those events from him, which is part of the problem, and why we want to see him appear at the justice committee and give his account of events so that they can be compared.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5800915">Mr. Speaker, I think the answer is pretty obvious. It is to have a full public inquiry. We need someone who is independent to investigate these matters. We have the Ethics Commissioner who is doing some of that, but under a very limited scope. We need an independent investigator who has a broad mandate to chase down all the different leads, corners and twists and turns that this story has taken. Only if we have that are people going to be satisfied that we are getting to the bottom of what is going on and that we are getting the truth. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800916">Trying to distract from the need for a public inquiry to get to that truth, using jobs as an excuse not to get to the bottom of what happened is a mistake and it is a little hard to take from a party that I watched ram through a bill to help outsource the maintenance work of Air Canada workers. It is a party that railroaded workers with back-to-work legislation. They were on a simple rotating strike, going out just a few days a month. The Liberals said that it was a crisis and they had to legislate them back to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800917">This is a government that has done damage to workers not just by commission, but by omission, by rolling over when GM said it was going to shut down an award-winning productive plant and move that work out of the country. It is a government that stood silent while a Crown corporation ordered a whole bunch of railcars from a German company to be produced in the United States instead of requiring any percentage of Canadian content.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800918">It is a government that still, after years of promising, has refused to change the legislative regime to protect the pensions of workers when their company has gone bankrupt. I am thinking of Sears, of Stelco workers and others who have watched their pensions disappear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5800919">If we want to talk about jobs, I would be happy to have a whole other debate about jobs and what the government could do to save a lot of jobs and save the pensions of a lot of Canadians. The fact is that it is not happening and these jobs came up to cover what Liberals were doing for their corporate buddies in a board room.</ParaText>
