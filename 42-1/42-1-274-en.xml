              <ParaText id="5315039">He said: Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="214552" Type="2">Foothills</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315040">I rise in the House today to speak to an important issue, although one that is also sad and shameful. Yes, I want to talk about the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s recent disastrous trip to India, as well as our immense need to get to the bottom of the unfounded accusations made against the Indian government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315041">Our Prime Minister has been arrogant and disrespectful to the House and elected members from all parties. He is in the habit of sharing information with journalists ahead of Parliament and that is shameful. His arrogance, his lack of judgment, and his impetuous behaviour has spoiled our diplomatic relations with India. The relationship between our two countries is in shambles. That relationship was built over years with a great deal of effort. It is sad, but true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315042">We have a Prime Minister who is not very keen on coming to the House to answer questions. I guess that when he was young and dreaming of becoming Prime Minister, it never occurred to him that as leader of the country he would have to be accountable to Canadians. I guess that he thought it would be just like in the movies, where decisions and problems are neatly wrapped up in the end. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315043">I honestly believe that the Prime Minister has woken up to the reality of his responsibilities and role and is in a state of shock. He rarely comes to the House, and when he does honour us with his presence, he does not answer the questions. He is all talk and no substance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315044">Let us review the facts. During the Prime Minister's family vacation to India, the media reported that a criminal convicted of attempted murder had been invited to one of the Canadian Prime Minister's events. To save face, the Prime Minister's first instinct was to do what he usually does and blame someone else for his own mistakes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315045">Usually, he blames our former prime minister, Stephen Harper, for all the mistakes that he and his ministers are making here in Canada. However, since he was in India, on the other side of the world, he could not find a Stephen Harper or a Conservative government, so he had to improvise. Since he is not overly skilled in the art of telling the truth, he made another mistake in an attempt to hide his first mistake. If you can imagine, our Prime Minister actually accused the Indian government of plotting to embarrass and undermine Canada by placing Mr. Atwal's name on the Prime Minister's guest list. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315046">To lend some credence to his made-up story, the Prime Minister sent a senior official to a media-only briefing, to try to sell them this story.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315047">Later, the Prime Minister said that he stood by the claims and accusations his official made against the Indian government. They did not hesitate to make allegations against India to Canadians, but they never provided any evidence or other information to justify their position. The Prime Minister ended up being the only one who believed the story he had made up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315048">That same day, both the <Affiliation DbId="229209" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> and the Liberal member for <Affiliation DbId="214497" Type="2">Surrey Centre</Affiliation> readily, though clumsily, denied the Prime Minister's claims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315049">From the very beginning, the Indian government rejected the accusations. Even Mr. Atwal confirmed, with deep dismay, that India had not been involved. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315050">Who are we to believe? We have two versions to choose from, the one from the Prime Minister and his national security adviser, and the one from the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Atwal, the Indian government itself, and the member for Surrey Centre. This latter group all denied that the Indian government had played a role in extending this invitation to Mr. Atwal. They all affirmed that there had been no plot, and the minister even apologized to the Indian government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315051">On the opposite side, there is the isolated and unrepentant Prime Minister, who continues to level serious accusations at India. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315052">This Prime Minister often uses big words to say nothing at all. This Prime Minister loves to hear the sound of his own voice. For all of these reasons, we need to shine a light on this affair. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315053">Every major nation knows that it is important to maintain good relations with other countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315054"> Year after year, we, as elected representatives, work hard in partnership with our staff in diplomatic affairs and other services to sign free trade agreements and increase our exports to new markets. This work is crucial because it is the main driver of job creation in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315055">In a fit of impulsiveness and wanton recklessness, our Prime Minister destroyed our business community's chances of securing business opportunities in the Indian market. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5315056">For all of these reasons, we need to hear the testimony of the public servant who could tell the House the whole truth about this infamous affair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315057">First, why did the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> force Daniel Jean to tell the media an unbelievable story? Now, that same Prime Minister is hindering the work of the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security by preventing Mr. Jean from answering the questions of elected officials. Why? Does he have something to hide? The Prime Minister likes to brag about being transparent and about having cleaner hands than any other leader in Canadian history. He claims to be the Obama of the north.</ParaText>

I sit with him on the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security, and I am pleased to support his efforts to have Mr. Jean appear before the committee, especially in this difficult situation. The Liberals do not want us to have the same briefing as the media. That is the difference. No matter one's views or party allegiance, the fact remains that the Liberals' conduct on this trip raised questions. I believe that at a bare minimum we should have the opportunity to hear from an expert who will explain how he arrived at his conclusions. I realize that we must always be prudent and careful when hearing from people who work on national security in a public forum. However, I believe that information has already been provided to the public by the media. There is nothing more public than that.<I /></ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5315078">Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to this issue. I will be taking a different tack on what we are discussing today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315079">Our motion is asking the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to come clean with the conspiracy theories he has been putting forward. This is an issue of concern for Canadians across the country who want to ensure that their Prime Minister is being honest, especially in his dealings with countries around the world like India, a trusted ally and one of the largest democracies in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315080"> I want to touch on the very real consequences of the lack of judgment of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, as a result of his actions in India, and the ramifications that we are feeling here at home. What should have been one of the top priorities for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> when he went to India was the significant trading issue we have with one of our most significant trading partners when it comes to Canadian agriculture, certainly with respect to our pulses, lentils, peas, and chickpeas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315081">The Conservative government grew Canada's pulse industry to a more than $4.5 billion industry. Farmers in my constituency of Foothills in southern Alberta and throughout the province are now growing crops like soybeans, chickpeas, and lentils, which were never grown there 10 years ago. As a result of new innovation and new technology they are able to grow these very lucrative crops. One of the reasons that they want to seed these crops is the opportunity to access lucrative new markets like India. However, over the last few months and as a result of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s actions in India, we have seen what was once a great opportunity for Canadian agriculture drop to not nearly that scope.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315082">For example, in the days after the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister </Affiliation> returned from India, the Indian government raised the tariff on Canadian chickpea exports from 40% to 60%. The Liberal government does not seem to understand the very real consequences for Canadians and Canadian entrepreneurs in agriculture as a result of its actions in India . Not only is this a question of the Prime Minister's embarrassing performance in India, but it is also having an impact here at home. I want to give the House some statistics with respect to just how profound this impact is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315083">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister </Affiliation> went to India to hopefully address some of these issues. When he came back, we found that not only had the issue not been addressed but it was substantially worse. To put that in perspective, the price Canadians were getting for a bushel of lentils prior to the fall was about $9 a bushel. Now we are getting just over $6.90 a bushel. That is a substantial decrease in the price that Canadians were getting for their product on the market. A great deal of that can be directly attributed to the Prime Minister's performance in India.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315084">The fumigation issue was one that we were hoping the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister </Affiliation> would be able to address on that trip. He said over there that they were able to bring that issue to the table, and I appreciate that, but they did not come home with any agreement, nothing was signed indicating that the fumigation issue was going to be addressed. In fact, there is no agreement. It is just maybe something that will be discussed further as we go through 2018. We have to understand the financial consequences of that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315085">When we talk about a shipment of these products that are going from Canada to India, we do not have the exemption on the fumigation, which we used to have. It sunsetted last December and the Indian government did not extend that exemption. It is now costing Canadian producers $700,000 per shipment on these products going to India. India is not asking us to necessarily fumigate our shipments, but it is charging us a fee when we send our products over there. India has also increased the tariffs on peas to 50% and on lentils to 30%. There is now a fear within the pulse industry in Canada that India could increase the tariffs on lentils to 100%, which is still within WTO rules.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5315086">My concern, and I think the concern that is shared by producers across the country, is that increasing these tariffs, including the latest one increasing the tariffs on chickpeas from 40% to 60%, is just a shot across the bow, just a warning shot that is saying to Canada that it must come clean with its actions when it comes to Jaspal Atwal and the claim that this was a conspiracy put forth by the Indian government. Until there is responsibility taken for the consequences, they are going to continue to take this out on Canadian farmers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315087"> I certainly do not believe that is fair in any way, shape, or form, when our farmers or Canadian producers are the ones who are paying the very real consequences for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his antics in India. Every single day here in question period, he continues to send mixed messages. Even in one single answer he is giving two different responses that simply do not mix. One cannot happen without the other. Either it was a conspiracy by the Indian government or it was an honest mistake, as the <Affiliation DbId="229209" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> has said. It has to be one or the other, and it cannot be both. Until the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> steps forward, takes responsibility, and shows some accountability for his actions, we are going to continue to face some of these consequences, and it could get worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315088">For example, there is a company in Saskatchewan that just recently signed a fertilizer agreement with India to supply India with potash. What makes this agreement so unprecedented is that it is the first potash mine in Canada that is being done in strong partnership with a first nation in Saskatchewan. The potash mine is actually on a first nation's land. This is something that the first nation community in northern Saskatchewan will benefit from. It is a memorandum of understanding between the first nation, the mining company, and India to supply potash. However, who is to say that they are not the next target? Will the next step for the Indian government be to say that they are not going to move forward with this agreement to supply potash from Canada to India? Is this another company or sector of industry that is going to be impacted by this?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315089">I want to give my colleagues a quote from Gord Bacon who is the CEO of Pulse Canada, and was on that trip with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to India. Earlier on, when it came to the fumigation issue, Gord Bacon said, “There was never a science-based reason [for fumigation]. We were having to mix biological science with political science and the two never mixed well.” Thus, even with Pulse Canada and our producers across the country, they are raising alarms on the consequences of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s actions in India and the very real implications that this is having on the ground.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315090">We are asking the Liberal government to quickly take action on this. I have to be honest. I am not expecting them to take quick action because we have certainly seen over the last several months that when it comes to Canadian agriculture and rural economic development, these are certainly not priorities for the Liberal government. In fact, when a lot of these issues were going on, our <Affiliation DbId="214302" Type="4">agriculture minister</Affiliation> was nowhere to be found.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315091">When the pulse and lentil tariffs were raised last fall, the Liberals sent a trade mission to India. The fumigation and trade issues with our pulse products were not even raised, not to mention that the <Affiliation DbId="214302" Type="4">agriculture minister</Affiliation> was not even part of that delegation that went to India to discuss possible free trade agreements with that trading partner. Then again, in January, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> went back to India. He took almost 20 MPs and ministers to go on his taxpayer family vacation and photo op extravaganza. This is one of the top issues that we are dealing with here, yet the agriculture minister was not among that massive entourage that went with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> on that trip.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315092">Then we talk about the grain backlog, which is another huge issue for our agriculture sector. The <Affiliation DbId="214302" Type="4">agriculture minister</Affiliation> said it is not really a very serious issue when our producers cannot get their products to market. The <Affiliation DbId="214333" Type="4">transportation minister</Affiliation> said that he is “satisfied” with what CN and CP are doing. Is he serious? At one point, sometimes only 6% of the railcars, the grain cars, that were ordered were actually being delivered. This tells me that when it comes to agriculture and rural economy, the Liberal government is more than happy to sacrifice our rural Canadians for their antics. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315093">We need a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who is going to take our global relations and our trading partnerships seriously. Canadian agriculture depends on it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5315109">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s objective was clear: to reaffirm that Canada stands with a united India.

Canada's Prime Minister took the pulse of the change afoot in India in order to guide Canadian stakeholders through this transformation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315113">The relationship between Canada and India is strong and mutually beneficial. Two-way trade between Canada and India is estimated to have reached $8.34 billion in calendar year 2017. This represents an increase of 3.9% over 2016, and an increase of over 30% just in the last three years. There is an estimated 1,000 Canadian companies active in the India market, of which 400 have a physical presence in the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315114">Despite these impressive figures, there is a palpable sense that Canada-India trade should be higher than it is right now, that there is enormous potential in India. The fact that our trade and investment numbers are low relative to the size of our GDP is just one example. On the same note, our negotiations on a comprehensive economic partnership agreement, known as CEPA, and a foreign investment protection and promotion agreement, known as FIPA, are important priorities for both countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315115">Closing these bilateral agreements has proven to be long and arduous, and we are not quite there yet.

              <ParaText id="5315116">To this end, in the joint statement issued by the leaders on February 23, Canada and India agreed to intensify negotiations to finalize both CEPA and FIPA.

              <ParaText id="5315123">By contrast, the Liberal government has been providing them with integrity funding as we undertake reviews to ensure they have the resources to match their mandates and the difficult tasks we ask them to do every day on behalf of Canadians. More than that, we are restoring the public trust and confidence in our security and intelligence agencies that eroded over the 10 years of the previous Harper government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315124">Last year, Parliament passed Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document>, which created the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians. For well over a decade, experts, academics, and parliamentary committees, including ones that I was on, have called for a committee of parliamentarians that would be mandated to review the work of our security and intelligence agencies and who would have the appropriate clearance to review all classified material. That committee is now up and running. It is currently reviewing and taking a look at our national security and intelligence apparatus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315125">We are also enhancing and making major changes to the existing review bodies by combining all entities with a mandate to review an individual department or agency into one body. Some academics have referred to this for years as a super SIRC. This too was called for in Justice Iacobucci's report and Justice O'Connor's report. Certainly in my time as the critic for public safety when I was in opposition, it was something that we called for and something that the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security called for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315126">We are calling it NSIRA, the national security intelligence review agency. There are benefits of having one review body that can actually follow the evidence as it moves from one agency to another. As an example, if SIRC were currently reviewing a CSIS operation and found that at one point CSIS had turned it over to the RCMP for an investigation, SIRC would not be able to follow the trail to see what the RCMP had done with that information. In other words, the security and intelligence review of matters would be siloed and there would not be the ability to follow them from one agency to the other. This would make knowing exactly what went on or what went wrong nearly impossible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315127">The Civilian Review and Complaints Commission, CRCC, could review what the RCMP has done with that information in the example that I gave earlier, but it would not be able to know what CSIS did in order to obtain it. Should Bill <Document DbId="9057418" Type="3">C-59</Document> be passed by Parliament, the new NSIRA would have a mandate to look at every department or agency within the national security and intelligence function.</ParaText>

New investments by the IDRC in 2018 will improve the working conditions of homeworkers and improve business practices in global supply chains. Canada announced $7.9 million for 40 Grand Challenges Canada projects in India, supporting women's empowerment, sexual and reproductive health rights, water and sanitation, and mental health. Finally, Canada and India launched the Nutrition International's Asia campaign called “She'll Grow Into It”. The campaign, supported by $11.5 million of funding through the right start initiative, works to empower the world's poorest women, adolescent girls, and children. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315131">On the last day of the visit, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> delivered a keynote speech before 5,000 youth at the 2018 Young Changemakers Conclave annual conference. At this event, captured live on Facebook, the Prime Minister emphasized the importance of gender equality, youth engagement, and diversity, and discussed the role of technology and innovation in empowering young leaders. Canada's Prime Minister heard directly from India's young leaders on how they are making their country and their world a better place in which to live. India has the largest youth population in the world, with more than 780 million under the age of 35. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315132">Speaking about youth, I want to turn to the topic of education. India has one of the largest higher education systems in the world. With over 30 million students enrolled in higher education every year, the demand far exceeds the supply. As a result, more than 550,000 Indian students opted to study abroad in 2017, and Canada is increasingly a destination of choice. Canadian institutions currently have over 400 arrangements with Indian institutions, and approximately 50 universities and colleges have a presence in India. In addition, the government has been proactively targeting students from abroad with the result that a record number of Indian students, an estimated 124,000, held a permit to study in Canada for six months or more in 2017. Canada now trails only the United States as a destination for Indian students going abroad for higher education.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315133">Academic collaboration is also moving forward at an accelerated pace. In 2016, Mitacs, a Canadian not-for-profit organization, brought 184 Indian researchers to Canada with funding of over $2 million through the Mitacs Globalink program and $736,000 in support from the Government of India. Since its launch in 2013, the India-Canada Centre for Innovative Multidisciplinary Partnerships to Accelerate Community Transformation and Sustainability, known as IC-IMPACTS, has delivered 38 projects that have resulted in 16 technology deployments in Canada and India in a variety of fields. Recognizing the importance of innovation, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and Prime Minister Modi welcomed a call for research proposals amounting to $4 million toward cleaning polluted bodies of water and mitigating fire hazards in buildings. Key partners in this initiative are IC-IMPACTS and India's departments of biotechnology and science and technology.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315134">During the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s trip, a memorandum of understanding on higher education was renewed, and Canada announced it will host the 2018 meeting of the joint working group that oversees implementation of that memorandum of understanding. As well, the Prime Minister recognized the 50th anniversary of the Shastri lndo-Canadian Institute in promoting understanding between India and Canada through academic activities and exchanges, with the support of both governments to the institute.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315135">To pursue this line further, if we continue to link youth and entrepreneurs in India and Canada and if we continue to encourage innovation and collaboration between academics, the private sector, and civil society, then government can back away and let these dynamics take over.

On regional and global issues, the leaders discussed the prevailing security situation in Afghanistan, calling for an immediate cessation of violence, renunciation of links with international terrorism, and the dismantling of infrastructure of support for terrorism. The leaders reaffirmed support to the government and the people of Afghanistan to achieve an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled national peace and reconciliation process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315137">The leaders called upon the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the DPRK, to abide strictly by its international obligations and commitments.

              <ParaText id="5315141">To promote and sustain collaboration, Canada's national interests call for a stronger relationship with India. To this end, the prime ministers of Canada and India reinforced the architecture of our security partnership. A dialogue of national security advisers was institutionalized. Canada's national security and intelligence adviser met with his Indian counterpart in New Delhi just prior to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s visit, and concluded a framework agreement on countering terrorism and violent extremism. This framework agreement reaffirms the shared resolve of India and Canada to combat terrorism and violent extremism in all their forms and manifestations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315142"> Canada and India agreed to step up bilateral collaboration under a newly-formed national security advisers' dialogue, the joint working group on counterterrorism and its experts' sub-group. Both leaders agreed to work collaboratively to address the threat posed by cross-border and state-sponsored terrorism, stop sources of terrorist financing, dismantle terrorist infrastructure, prevent the supply of arms to terrorists, and to counter violent extremism and radicalization to violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315143">On broader defence and security issues, the leaders committed to develop bilateral defence co-operation by exploring possibilities in diverse fields, including cold climate training. They agreed that Canada and India would coordinate on cybersecurity and address cybercrimes at bilateral and multilateral fora going forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315144"> India sent a high-level delegation to the Vancouver peacekeeping defence ministerial meeting in November 2017. It is the world's third largest contributor to international peacekeeping operations. The two leaders decided in India to enhance co-operation on peacekeeping to provide an effective response to global challenges. They stressed the importance of integrating gender perspectives into peace and security activities, and interventions in line with the women, peace and security agenda, including prevention of conflict-related sexual violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315145">Taken as a whole, this visit reflects an important step forward in the Canada-India relationship. There is much our two countries can offer each other, in commercial and security terms and in the fruits of collaboration in international fora. To recognize the future of this commercial partnership, Canada and India announced a new dialogue on innovation, growth, and prosperity. This is a collaboration between Canada's Centre for International Governance Innovation and India's Gateway House. It will convene subject experts, government officials, and business leaders to promote economic growth and innovation in today's digital economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315146"> It is unfortunate that, rather than celebrating all of the accomplishments, the opposition is using today to attack public servants and question their non-partisanship. I will say one more time that Canada's national security agencies are non-partisan, highly competent, and effective. We trust them to promote and protect the security of Canadians. That is why I will be voting against the motion. </ParaText>

When we look at the size of our two GDPs and our two economies, this is what we hear from global experts.

That they would actually politicize the collective work of our workers at their expense I think will make this a watershed moment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315172">What has happened is that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s trip to India went off the rails. They admitted that 14 members and six cabinet ministers went along. They had 20 members go over there, and all kinds of things happened. These are things they are concerned about, whether it was flying chefs across the country and eventually to India, hiring for fashion design and photography, or the parties, where they ran out of booze. It became embarrassing. All those things happened, and their members were part of that and were there for that. It was supposed to be a positive public relations exercise and it has turned wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315173">The serious nature of this is the defence of the Atwal situation. We have a person convicted of a very serious crime in Canada, who went through our court system, who was put on one of these party lists. There has been controversy, blaming, and finger pointing about how he got on that list. What was serious was the blame that went to the Indian government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315174">They can write all they want about the positive things, such as trade with India and the cultural connections, all those things many of us experience in our ridings on a daily basis, but at the end of the day, with the finger pointing by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> across the ocean to a foreign country, it became a very serious matter. It is one of the reasons they became an international laughingstock.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5315175">All one has to do is google this trip. For CNN, <I>The Washington Post</I>, and overseas media it not only became a story for the day but became a continuing story. Here we had the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of one of the most important democracies in the world pointing the finger at another democracy, because he was politically embarrassed. That is not going to be un-watched, forgotten, or brushed under the covers. This is a pattern of behaviour. This is about a problem the government has.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315176">Unfortunately, the government would like that to go away, but this was all done with public money. This was all done under the rules and regulations of the democracy we have, and part of that is accountability. That is what the official opposition and our party are supposed to be doing. That is part of our democracy. It is a principle element to make sure that we are going to stay true to being open and transparent. Maybe we could debate the level of that, but there are certain laws.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315177">What happened is that we and the official opposition asked that this individual, in a key moment in diplomatic relations, which will not go away, come before committee. That is important, because he will have to give testimony, and it will have to be truthful or he will perjure himself. When people come before parliamentary committees, they have to provide the truth, or they will be subject to further punishment under the law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315178">The concern of the Liberals is that the person would then lose his cover, and most importantly, the Liberals would lose their cover on something very embarrassing and very serious.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315179">Today's motion is very reasonable. The process would be televised. Canadians will be able to judge for themselves the politics of this. More importantly, the accountability of this House will be enshrined, and it will be determined whether appropriate things did or did not take place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315180">We have had these watershed moments in the past. I have been around here long enough to have seen everything from the sponsorship scandal to the Schreiber-Mulroney issue and any number of different things. I am working right now on the issues related to Facebook and data privacy breaches. It actually goes back to the Liberal Party, as it is one of their creatures who was involved in this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315181">The reality is that at least through that process at committee, there would be an accountable lens applied to our governing practices. The Liberals may not like that, but they have been on this end and they have been on that end. The reality is that this is what happens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315182">That is why I take great offence to the Liberals saying that this is an attack on our public service. Under the previous administration, the Conservatives had practices that I did not like and did not support. There needed to be some serious talk about what was happening to scientists and a series of other things. We have seen some of that change, but very little.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315183">For the Liberals to suggest that the Conservatives are doing this as a broader attack on the people who get up every single day to provide services for Canadians is shameful, disrespectful, and harmful, and it further erodes the reasons people should be involved in the public service to begin with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315184">We are talking about a senior position. It is someone who reports to the ministers and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and is expected to provide information and intelligence. The Prime Minister and ministers decide what to do with that. That is now being repeated by government members with respect to the Atwal situation and whether he gets an invite or does not get an invite, and who is at fault and who is not at fault.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315185"> That has led to an international incident in the sense that we are now forever branded, under the current administration of the Indian government and our current Liberal government, as the government that is willing to point the finger and say that it does not really want to find out what took place on our soil with our own people. The Liberals will just say that it is that country's fault. That is not the way to go about work.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5315187">First of all, we need to remember Mr. Atwal's background. He is actually a long-time friend of the Liberal Party. He has known the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in the past. For the Liberals to pretend that they do not know anything about him is just at attempt to mislead Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315188">The parliamentary secretary said that there is only one version of this. Well, there are actually four versions. There is Daniel Jean's version, there is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister's</Affiliation> version, there is the <Affiliation DbId="229209" Type="4">foreign affairs minister's</Affiliation> version, and there is Mr. Atwal's version. It is reasonable for the opposition to be asking questions about which one of those is true. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315189">When the government says that it believes that there is a non-partisan public service and that it trusts our public service, what I think it is actually saying is that it trusts that Daniel Jean is not going to tell what really happened. That is one of the reasons I suspect the government is going to try to keep him from going to committee. I think when we hear from him, we will hear that the Liberals are using the non-partisan public service to try to achieve their goals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315190">Why do you think Canadian MPs are being asked to settle for less information and less access to Mr. Jean than the media has already had?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5315201">Madam Speaker, today we are discussing a motion to instruct one of our public officers to appear before a committee to try to shed some light on a situation about which we have heard far too many stories.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315202">This situation occurred during the trip to India. I think is important to present some of the key aspects of the trip. First of all, most Canadians have absolutely no idea what the strategy was behind this trip and this is true of various aspects. For example, when it comes to the criteria the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> used for determining who would join him on the trip, there is no way of getting a guest list or understanding exactly the purpose of the trip. I think that there were a number of ministers who could have made a valuable contribution to the debate in India and that it would have been important to include them, but they were not there. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315203">Why was the <Affiliation DbId="229217" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation> not there? That is an important question. I would think that in planning a trip to India, the Minister of International Trade would have a stake. What is more, if he had been there, then there would have been at least one person there who can speak French. I think we have every right to ask that question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315204">One of the people whose name came up the most often was the <Affiliation DbId="214302" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food</Affiliation>. I think that he should have been there, given the trade issues regarding chickpeas and lentils. India has increased import tariffs on chickpeas from 30% to 40%. That has a direct impact on our farmers and yet neither the <Affiliation DbId="229217" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation> nor the <Affiliation DbId="214302" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food</Affiliation> were there to talk about it. That alone raises a number of questions, but the list goes on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315205">Right now, there is an unprecedented labour shortage in our rural regions. Why did the <Affiliation DbId="229219" Type="4">Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship</Affiliation> not go on that trip to discuss the possibility of establishing partnerships to recruit workers who would be interested in coming to Canada to work? That would have been a very relevant and worthwhile discussion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315206">Recently, we learned that companies are now subcontracting the reading of X-rays to India. Hospitals are sending X-rays and other scans to specialized medical clinics in India to be read. Had the <Affiliation DbId="233811" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> been invited, she could have raised the legitimate concern of the reliability of those readings. She also could have raised the question that many Canadians are asking about this practice, and that is whether their personal medical data is adequately protected when the analysis of X-ray results are subcontracted to India. That would have been a very relevant question, and in my opinion, the <Affiliation DbId="233811" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> could have contributed to that debate. However, she was not there either.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315207">They also chose not to take the <Affiliation DbId="229211" Type="4">Minister of Status of Women</Affiliation> even though India is among the countries where women have the most difficult living conditions. Absolutely horrible cases of gang rapes of women of the lowest castes have been reported by the media. I believe that the Minister of Status of Women could have had fruitful discussions with the Indian government about what is happening and assessed how to collaborate and provide India with tools to improve the quality of life of these women. However, she was not there either. What was the strategy and the purpose of this trip? What were they trying to accomplish?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315208">I am going to talk a little about the schedule because MPs, when they are available, are asked to travel abroad to discuss issues. When I travel abroad, I always have an extremely busy schedule. Honestly, between my work day and a working dinner in the evening, I often have barely enough time to change. I change in five minutes and go from one event to the next. I do not understand how the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had so much time to go sightseeing everywhere. It seemed much more like a sightseeing tour than a prime minister's state visit.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5315209"> For such a trip, I expect the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to attend a series of meetings on a tight schedule and have very little opportunity to go sightseeing, or at least keep it very brief. When a Prime Minister travels abroad, he is expected to meet with people, visit companies, and do a very serious job with specific objectives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315210"> Unfortunately, there were not very many photos of the Prime Minister having meetings. Instead, we saw a lot of pictures of the Prime Minister visiting tourist attractions with his wife and children. That raises questions, particularly given his headline-making trip to the Aga Khan’s island. The Prime Minister should have shown restraint, and he should request that his trips be strictly professional from now on, so there is no longer any doubt as to what they are for. It is too bad that there were no specific visits or a structured, goal-oriented agenda for his India trip.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315211">The disaster in question is the invitation sent to Mr. Atwal, who attended an event, by the way. It was only after the second event that this invitation was withdrawn, when it was realized that he was there. We heard different versions from a lot of people: from the Prime Minister, from the <Affiliation DbId="229217" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation>, from Mr. Atwal himself, from the member who decided to take the blame, and even from the Indian government. Nothing in this story holds water. Indeed, one of our public servants, who is non-partisan, is not permitted to appear before a committee. This makes absolutely no sense. If someone is able to provide the most impartial and accurate information, it would be precisely this person. It therefore makes absolutely no sense to refuse to hear from this individual in committee. We need some light shed on this, especially given the situation this has thrown us into. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315212"> Our diplomatic relations with India are a disaster, since the Prime Minister accused it of being behind this invitation. This is totally ludicrous. What is more, he did it without providing hard evidence, which makes it even worse. If solid evidence had been provided, I would have found it a little strange, but at least there would have been some proof. Not only did the Prime Minister suggest this, but he did so without providing any evidence to either the House or the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security. It is all very disturbing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315213">This is a member of the Commonwealth, a country that swears allegiance to the same Crown as we do. I have had the chance to meet with several of its members of parliament. It is a country that we have a relationship with, and yet, this has been allowed to happen and nothing is being done to remedy the situation. The incident occurred almost a month ago and they are still sticking to the same story, despite its many holes and the fact that it is undermining our relationship, rather than putting a stop to all of this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315214">The trip was an unmitigated disaster, but now it is high time to end this farce. We need to know what really happened, and those who provided inaccurate information need to apologize so we can move forward and rebuild our relationship with India. Unfortunately, because both parties are determined to stick to their contradictory versions of events and refusing to shed light on what happened, our relations with India remain strained.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315215"> This situation could have consequences for months, if not years to come. This could even have repercussions on the relationships that subsequent governments will have with India. This is particularly worrisome. The least they could do is to allow Daniel Jean to appear before a committee, given the mess that the Prime Minister has put us in.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="213959" Type="2">Mr. Gérard Deltell (Louis-Saint-Laurent, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5315230">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to announce that I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="213951" Type="2">Edmonton—Wetaskiwin</Affiliation>. I would like to read from page 24 of a document that was published almost three years ago. It says, “It is time to shine more light on government...” It is the Liberal Party of Canada who said that, and it is true. The time has come for the Liberal government to shine some light on the pathetic scandal concerning Mr. Atwal and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315231">As the saying goes, one lie begets another, and that is exactly what happened with the scandal involving Mr. Atwal and the Liberal Prime Minister of Canada. Unfortunately for us all, our Prime Minister disgraced Canada and Canadians around the world during his infamous mission to India. There was a dramatic and appalling incident the likes of which have never been seen in the history of Canada: a criminal attended a diplomatic event that the Prime Minister was also expected to attend. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315232"> I will not discuss in detail the trip during which we saw the Prime Minister spend eight days with six ministers and 14 other members, take pictures of everything, change his clothes five times a day every day of the week and show up at events dressed up in native costumes while everyone else was wearing Western garb. I will not discuss that. Nor will I discuss the fact that the <Affiliation DbId="214302" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture</Affiliation>, and God knows that that was important, did not participate in the mission. However, I will discuss the biggest blunder, the presence of criminal Jaspal Atwal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315233"> Who is this man? In 1986, Jaspal Atwal was found guilty of the attempted murder of an Indian minister in Vancouver. The House will probably remember that, during question period, my colleague, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214458" Type="2">Yellowhead</Affiliation>, described a situation that deeply moved me. He had witnessed the police operation leading to the arrest of the criminal when he was an RCMP officer. Jaspal Atwal was found guilty of attempted murder. The same Jaspal Atwal was present at the events surrounding the Prime Minister’s visit to India.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315234">Here is the sequence of events that led to today’s motion to have Daniel Jean, the National Security Advisor to the Prime Minister of Canada, appear before a parliamentary committee. The criminal Atwal was present at an official event during a Canadian diplomatic mission to Mumbai, and that is when our suspicions were aroused. Mr. Atwal had his picture taken with all sorts of people, including our Prime Minister’s wife. I call him our Prime Minister because he is every Canadian’s prime minister. Unfortunately, he has not been up to the task, and he has not acted with the dignity befitting his position. When these events unfolded, when Mr. Atwal was found in attendance at a diplomatic event in Mumbai, the CBC began asking questions and uncovered the truth, identifying him. It then began to ask what a criminal was doing at such an event. That is when the Prime Minister had to come up with an explanation. He immediately said that it was the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214497" Type="2">Surrey Centre</Affiliation> who had invited Atwal. He said that the hon. member took full responsibility for the event.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315235"> First of all, and I will be frank, it is very cowardly on the part of a prime minister to lay the blame on someone else. When you are a leader, you must assume full responsibility for your troops. You do not find a scapegoat and say, “You're responsible. You're taking the blame, I'm out of here.” A leader assumes full responsibility for his troops. In this case, he did not, and what comes next is even worse. Since the situation began to escalate, the National Security Advisor to the Prime Minister of Canada, Daniel Jean, met with journalists to give them a technical briefing on the situation. I was a journalist for 20 years, and I have been to dozens, even hundreds of these meetings. They are always interesting, because they give us a glimpse of the details about very specific situations, numbers, data and statistics that are not necessarily interesting to the public, but that allow us to get a better grasp of the situation. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5315236"> At that technical briefing, the National Security Advisor did not talk about how many Canadians eat cereal in the morning. What he said was far more political. According to the media, at that briefing, the National Security Advisor to the Prime Minister of Canada said that the criminal Atwal’s presence was a plot orchestrated by the Indian government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315237"> I like history, but try as I might, I could not remember one situation in the history of Canadian diplomacy that was as embarrassing, as shameful or as irresponsible as this one. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315238"> Need I point out that India is a Commonwealth country, that we have very close ties with India and that we need to preserve them? This situation with the criminal Atwal at a diplomatic event completely severed the bonds of trust and friendship that we need to have with a country as important as India. That the Prime Minister asked the senior official responsible for national security to meet with journalists to tell them something like that is of serious consequence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315239"> That is where all the contradictions start. In the House on February 27, the Prime Minister agreed with the version given the journalists by his National Security Advisor to explain the presence of the criminal Atwal, in other words that it was an plot fomented by the Indian government. The next day, on February 28, India, highly offended, vigorously denied this version of the facts and squarely laid the blame on our Prime Minister. I say “our” Prime Minister because the entire country is now paying for the Liberal Prime Minister’s mistake. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315240"> So, on February 27, the Prime Minister told the House that he agreed with his National Security Advisor’s position that he was the victim of an Indian conspiracy. On March 3, we heard from the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214497" Type="2">Surrey Centre</Affiliation>, the guy the Prime Minister picked out of a hat and blamed, then tossed aside like an old slipper. The hon. member said that it was his fault, that he was the one who had invited Atwal. This contradicts what the Prime Minister said, in other words that India was behind it all. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315241">That is not all. On March 9, the criminal Atwal, not without pointing out that he knew the Prime Minister very well, not without pointing out that he had participated in dozens and dozens of Liberal Party activities in his part of the country, said that he received the invitation from the High Commission, that he honoured the invitation and that India had nothing to do with it. This contradicts the Prime Minister’s version. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315242"> Lastly, on March 11, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who is not exactly a nobody in cabinet, said, “It’s an honest mistake.” It is an honest mistake on Canada’s part. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315243"> So who is telling the truth? Is it the Prime Minister, who is relying on his senior official who is telling all the journalists that it is a conspiracy, or is it the hon. member for Surrey Centre, who is saying that he is at fault? Is it the senior official who says one thing, or is it Atwal, who says that he is responsible, that he went on his own? Or is it the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who says that it was an honest mistake?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315244"> That is what I was saying. When you do not tell the truth, you end up stuck in a web of lies. That is the issue here, and that is why it is at the heart of the motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315245"> The motion put forward by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="214522" Type="2">Charlesbourg—Haute-Saint-Charles </Affiliation> would finally allow Canadians to learn the truth. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315246"> Here is a senior official, Daniel Jean, who met with journalists to make serious accusations, to say that India was responsible for having the criminal Atwal show up at diplomatic events. That is what he said. Great. He said that to journalists, who wrote it down. Also great. Now, let him tell that directly to Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315247"> That is what we are asking, but, oh, what a surprise, these people who got elected by saying that it was time for a transparent government are refusing Canadians the most basic transparency: allowing people who said things to journalists to testify before a committee. Why such obfuscation? The best way for Canadians to finally learn the truth is for them to hear this guy testify rather than continue to cover it up.</ParaText>

That is what would have been expected of any government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315249"> However, when we look at the simple facts of that, the opposition wants to try to bring in someone from the public service, someone who has an incredible record within the public service, which represents Canadian interests and is non-partisan. Given the simple truth of the matter, why do the Conservatives, and somehow they have coerced the NDP to come on side, feel they should be able to pick and choose public servants, whoever they might be, today it is this one, on any issue whatsoever they choose to make political?</ParaText>

One of the things that we have noticed over the course of the last two and a half years is that the hallmarks of the Liberal government seem to be arrogance and attacks, constant arrogance and constant attacks. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315261">We heard it today from the parliamentary secretary to the government House leader. He used a common approach earlier today. The Liberals use this approach oftentimes whenever anybody criticizes the government. They refer to the election of 2015 as though, somehow, because 40% of the people that voted in Canada voted for them, there should be no opposition in this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315262">When we take a look at what Canadians voted for in 2015, it is kind of interesting. They voted for a promise of democratic reform, for example, a promise that was completely broken by the Liberal party. We had opposition members from all parties come together on a proposal for electoral reform. A committee put together by the government recommended to the government an avenue, but because it was not the Liberal avenue, the avenue the Liberals wanted, they rejected it wholeheartedly. Then what did they do? Of course, they blamed the opposition. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315263">The Liberals promised modest budget deficits in their platform and a balanced budget by the next year. Of course, we are nowhere near a balanced budget. We are going to be running deficits for decades to come. However, every time the opposition raises a question, a legitimate question about a promise that was made in the platform and completely ignored, all we get is attacks from the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315264"> The Liberals promised a new era of accountability and transparency. How did that go for them? We saw over the course of the last year, as we discussed in this place, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s visit to the Aga Khan's private island. There were legitimate questions that were ultimately borne out by the Ethics Commissioner in her report, a scathing report.

              <ParaText id="5315265">We were promised sunny ways in this place, a new era of sunny ways. Then, this morning when we were raising a very legitimate question about our relationship with the world's largest democracy, the hon. parliamentary secretary referred to it as character assassination. Somehow by raising these legitimate questions it is character assassination because we have the gall to suggest as parliamentarians that a senior public servant would appear before a parliamentary committee.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5315304">Mr. Speaker, the motion specifically puts into question the professionalism of some of our most senior public servants. Members of the opposition parties can say whatever they like, but let us not forget the professionalism that is brought to the table day in and day out by our civil servants. These individuals are at the top of their careers. When they make these statements, they do it with professionalism. They bring to the table a great deal of experience and expertise and reflect what is in Canada's and Canadians' best interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315305">When it comes time to vote on this resolution, I would encourage members to reflect on what the hidden agenda of Canada's official opposition party is. I would argue that we are doing a disservice by suggesting that the motion should actually pass. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315306">There are a number of things I would like to share with the House. The mover of the motion talked very quickly and off topic. He was not really talking about why civil servants should be coming forward; rather, he attacked the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and a member made reference to my question about character assassination. The member continued to compare Stephen Harper's trip in 2012 to what has taken place this year. He said Prime Minister Harper went to India and promoted trade. However, he did not share the full story about that trip to India.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315307">I was sitting in the opposition when Stephen Harper went to India. The member did not tell the House that Stephen Harper had to bring his car with him, I guess because he did not have confidence in the vehicles in India. It cost $1 million. That made some headlines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315308">Even if that had been in the headlines, I would still not underestimate the importance when a prime minister travels abroad in order to enhance relationships. When the mover of the motion talked about a comparison, members across laughed when I said I would compare the Harper administration any day to this administration. They are very proud of Stephen Harper and good for them. They can get behind him all they want, but I can tell them that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is very much in touch with Canadians. We have a prime minister who actually holds public town halls in the different regions of Canada affording Canadians the opportunity to ask the questions they feel are important. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has been in Winnipeg twice hosting those types of forums. That is one of the major differences between the two prime ministers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315309">When I look at the India trip, yes, there were some very important things taking place even back in 2012. I will acknowledge that. In 2012, not only did I criticize Stephen Harper for taking the car over, to the tune of $1 million, but I also acknowledged, whether I was speaking at gurdwaras or within my community, that having the prime minister travel to India is a good thing.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="05">(1205)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5315310">I believe that the opposition, a joint opposition nowadays, is doing a disservice to that wonderful relationship that we have with India today.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5315314">We have a growing Indo-Canadian community. It is one of the fastest-growing communities in Canada today. We can look at the city of Winnipeg and the impact that community has had on Winnipeg over the last 10, 20, 30 years. It is virtually second to no other community. In fact, in the north end, it is one of the driving forces behind the economic activity we are seeing in a very real and tangible way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315315">One of the greatest assets we have as a nation is our diversity. If we look at the Indo-Canadian community in particular with over a million people of Indo-Canadian heritage, it should be a given that any prime minister would make India a priority, as this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315316">Somewhere in the neighbourhood of 1,000 Canadian businesses in one form or another today have some sort of economic link to India. That number is growing every year. Hundreds of those businesses actually have a physical presence in India. Those individuals are helping create jobs here in Canada and in India.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315317">Do the Conservatives and their NDP friends, who want to help them a lot nowadays, recognize the many benefits that were derived out of that trip? They want to focus on an innocent mistake as opposed to talking about the opportunities. If they got in touch with their constituents, they would find that India is a country that warrants the attention this government is giving it. If we continue to develop those relationships, both countries will benefit. That is really what that trip was all about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315318">Imagine $1 billion of extra activity between two countries in good part because of that trip, at least partly as a direct result of the trip. That will generate thousands of jobs for Canadians. We do not hear opposition members recognizing that, but that is fine. They do not have to. We are not twisting their arms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315319">I would have been more encouraged by the debate if the opposition motion had been about how important it is that Canada build a stronger relationship with India, maybe even looking at ways to enhance trade between the two countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315320">I was at a Canada House event one evening where businesses, non-profits, and others were in attendance. I was part of many of the informal discussions that were taking place. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> addressed that group and talked about the importance of the relationship between India and Canada. Not only were people there appreciating what he had to say but there must have been dozens of phones recording what was being said by the Prime Minister, and I suspect it was all over social media.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315321">When the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada makes a trip of that nature, we cannot buy that kind of advertising for Canada in India. It just cannot be bought. The amount of attention that was given because our Prime Minister went to India is significant among the people of India and also back home in Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="10">(1210)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5315322">Many members of the Indo-Canadian community in particular have approached me and talked to me about the trip in a positive fashion. I can count on one hand, and maybe only use two fingers of that hand, the criticisms that have been brought to my attention personally on the issue. However, I would need a lot more than two hands to count the amount of appreciation that I have witnessed just from one community alone in regard to the benefits of the trip. I understand and appreciate just how important that trip was. It was about building relationships. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315323">The New Democrats talk about the 14 MPs and I believe it was six ministers who went. I was one of those members of Parliament who went. I paid my own way to get there, but I can tell those members that I enjoyed the experience. I had the opportunity to meet with hundreds of individuals. I was able to speak to students at elementary and secondary schools and at colleges, to share all sorts of wonderful ideas and thoughts about how important it is that we continue to build those bridges. It was a fantastic experience. Most of my time was spent in the Punjab, one of the states I truly enjoy being in. I have been there before. Many of my constituents spend the months of January and February and even longer in the Punjab region of India. These ties give Canada a strategic advantage over other countries in the world. We should be fostering and encouraging that wherever we can.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315324">Let us look at some of the benefits. I made reference to $1 billion. A billion dollars is a significant amount of money. On an annual basis, we are talking about 40,000 jobs, if we were to allocate it just to minimum wage jobs here in Canada. A billion dollars is a lot of money. More significant than that $1 billion is the amount of trade between Canada and India today. I believe it is just over $8 billion. In the last year or so, it has increased significantly. I suggest that if the opposition members were to open their eyes and get a better understanding of the potential that is there through an enhanced relationship between Canada and India, that number could increase dramatically, and I believe that it will. A good reason for it to increase is that we have a government in Canada today that has a very proactive approach on trade and is very much interested in what is taking place in India.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315325">I was amazed. As I said, I spent most of my time in the Punjab. When the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> came to the Golden Temple, there were banners and thousands of people who wanted to see him. It is truly encouraging, and we should be proud of that fact, no matter what side of the House we sit on, because we cannot buy that type of public relations and advertising within the country of India. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315326">I had no sense of what the international media were reporting here, but in India the<Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was exceptionally well received, from what I could see. At the events that I participated in, a couple of them in New Delhi but otherwise in the Punjab, there was that recognition when talking to people, “Oh, yes, the Prime Minister of Canada is here.”</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5315327">I have been to India before, and I have never seen a past prime minister receive the type of recognition this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> received in terms of having that physical presence in the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315328">When we talk about that event, I posed this in one of my questions with regard to Mr. Atwal. Unfortunately, an invite went out that should not have, and when it was discovered it was rescinded. Rescinded means that it was taken away, and that the individual in question did not show up at Canada's High Commission. At the end of the day, at times mistakes happen. The government has been straightforward with that issue. However, what we see now is a concentrated attempt from the opposition to say that it wants this civil servant to come before a standing committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315329">A couple of thoughts come to mind offhand. First and foremost, I believe we have a professional civil servant with an incredible career who acts in the best interests of Canadians, who did his job, and now, because the opposition wants to stir a pot and cause other issues, it says it wants him to come to committee. It wants to politicize it. Yes, that is what it is attempting to do. There is a standing committee for this. The Conservatives have already attempted to get the standing committee to deal with it. Standing committees operate on their own. Leave it with the standing committee, and let us see what happens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315330">I have been a parliamentarian for a good number of years, over 25 years or somewhere around there. At the end of the day, I have the deepest amount of respect for the fine work civil servants do. The Conservatives will argue today that this is an outstanding situation, and that they need to have this civil servant come before them, so they can ask him their politically charged questions. Well, they could make that argument for every public civil servant. On virtually any given day, they could be challenging civil servants to come before a committee of the House. Any opposition could generate why it believes a particular civil servant should be called before a committee of the House. Today, it just happens to be that civil servant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315331">If there was any sort of an official opposition that had confidence in the public service, as we do on this side, I do not believe we would be seeing this motion before the House today. If the Conservatives were true to their thoughts and feelings with regard to the importance of international trade, I would have suggested that today would have been a better day spent debating potential trade and other related issues with India. For example, I would like to hear what members across the way think we can do to continue to enhance those trade opportunities. We have so much in common with India, for example, a member of the Commonwealth, democracy, and a free market system. Most importantly, again from my perspective, we have an Indo-Canadian community of over a million people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315332">There are so many possibilities, and the sky is virtually unlimited in terms of how we can continue to build those bridges between Canada and India. The relationship today is far better between Canada and India than it was two years ago, and it will continue to get better. I predict now, and make it very clear, that we will continue to see more relationships being built, and more trade opportunities between both great nations.</ParaText>

We are even more in agreement that we have enormous confidence in the officers of Parliament. That is precisely why the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security wants to meet with Mr. Jean. The reason is that we no longer trust the Prime Minister.

              <ParaText id="5315356">Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand in the House of Commons in this debate with my Conservative colleagues. Just seeing the degree of animation, vitriol, and concern from the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="229526" Type="18">deputy House leader</Affiliation> kind of reminds me of something an old bomber command veteran told me. He said, “You know you're over your target when you're getting heavy fire from the ground.” The desperate machinations of the Liberal Party on this issue show us that this, I believe, is an attempt by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office to obstruct Parliament from getting to the answers on the Atwal affair or to cover up the whole situation with Mr. Jean. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315357">To illustrate that, in the time I have, I will start my remarks with a quote. My friend from Winnipeg, the deputy House leader for the Liberals, knows I love reading what people said when they were in opposition and comparing that to their positions in government. I am going to do that right now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315358">In opposition, with respect to public safety and security issues for Canada in October 2014, someone said, “being able to ask questions is essential in a democracy, even in difficult situations—especially in difficult situations.” The person who said that, when in opposition, was then the MP for Papineau, now the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada. I agree with that sentiment. I wonder what has happened to the Prime Minister. Difficult questions in difficult situations need to be asked when it comes to public safety and security. Remember, he said “especially in difficult situations”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315359">The difficult situation Canada finds itself in vis-à-vis the India Atwal scandal is perhaps the greatest diplomatic scandal Canada has ever witnessed. I do not say that with hyperbole, because India is a close friend to Canada. It is a Commonwealth partner. It is a country that bilateral trade doubled under the Conservative government of which I was a part. Many of us, and many Canadians, remember fondly. It is a Commonwealth partner with which we have enhanced relationships on security, nuclear technology, and bilateral relationships in trade. That has all been put at risk because of the careless and reckless actions of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. The trip was entirely premised on domestic politics. Virtually everyone who was on the trip, including the deputy House leader of the Liberal Party, my friend from Winnipeg, and virtually every event the trip had in its plan was based on currying favour and winning votes here in Canada, and it all backfired. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315360">The denial by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="214300" Type="4">public safety minister</Affiliation> to allow parliamentarians to ask questions has led to the Atwal India affair and the cover-up I am concerned about, and has brought us here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315361">For Canadians watching at home, let us see if we are being unreasonable here. My friend, the deputy House leader, almost foaming at the mouth, suggests we are not bringing in appropriate debate, that we are overstating the scandal with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s trip to India. Let us see what our request is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315362"> All the opposition is asking for is that Daniel Jean, the national security adviser to the Prime Minister of Canada, provide members of Parliament with the same briefing and the same ability to ask questions that Daniel Jean gave to members of the media. Canadians, through the members of Parliament, deserve the same right to hear from Mr. Jean on this wild India conspiracy theory. Suggestions by the <Affiliation DbId="214300" Type="4">public safety minister</Affiliation> that this material is somehow confidential is wrong. Why? Because the Liberals' own conduct shows that. By putting forward the national security adviser to select members of the press gallery, who write stories that thousands or millions of Canadians read, the Liberals were directly saying that anything Mr. Jean was saying was not top secret, was not confidential, because he was briefing people who tell things for a living.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5315363">That same basic right belongs with each member of Parliament. I have before you, Mr. Speaker, a privilege motion saying that my privilege and my rights, as both a member of Parliament and as the foreign affairs critic to hold the government to account for the most disastrous foreign trip in the history of our country, are being fettered as a member, or hampered, by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s unwillingness to allow the national security adviser, Mr. Jean, to appear before a committee of parliamentarians to give the same briefing and answer the same questions the Prime Minister's Office allowed him to do for the media.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315364">Why did he allow the national security adviser to speak to the media? It was to save face in the midst of the disastrous India trip, where the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was being mocked internationally for having no agenda, for having multiple elaborate costumes at events that made even Indian politicians and members of the arts community feel uncomfortable, for not taking the <Affiliation DbId="229217" Type="4">trade minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="214302" Type="4">agriculture minister</Affiliation> to India when, at the moment, the most pressing bilateral issue was a potential tariff increase to chickpeas and pulse products.</ParaText>

The member for <Affiliation DbId="213924" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> may have paid his own way, because this was a domestic, political trip. Everyone who went, the schedule, the photos, the agenda was all premised on preening the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> before his supporters, his fundraisers, and voters in a few ridings. When it backfired, it backfired on him and on all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315366">Our request, to quote Mr. Swift, is a modest proposal. Parliamentarians are entitled to the same information that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s adviser gave to members of the media. That is our basic right as parliamentarians, which is why there is a privilege motion in front of you, Mr. Speaker, but also why we have brought this important debate to the House of Commons today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315367">For those following this debate, they have followed this saga for over a month. I have never seen such negative international headlines about a Canadian prime ministerial visit. One foreign columnist said that it was a moving train wreck. Is that what those members mean by “Canada is back”? Canada has a world-class, stellar reputation around the world, and it has been put at risk because of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and because of the India scandal with Jaspal Atwal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315368">Let us get to the bottom of the scandal and the two competing stories from the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315369"> One story was that the member for <Affiliation DbId="214497" Type="2">Surrey Centre</Affiliation> invited Mr. Atwal, admitting afterwards that he should not have, but took sole responsibility and resigned for it. He fell on his sword, saying, “My bad, it was all me.” Then, a few days later, when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> allowed his national security adviser to meet with the media, the government floated this sinister and, we would submit, preposterous theory that Mr. Atwal was invited by the India government to embarrass the Prime Minister. Both of those things cannot be true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315370"> When the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="214300" Type="4">public safety minister</Affiliation> deny parliamentarians their right to ask questions about which story is true, they are impeding Parliament and are covering up which story is true from Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315371">I will show, directly in quotes by all the key figures, what I mean. Jaspal Atwal, himself, in a rather comical at times press conference he held a few weeks said this, “When I asked to consider attending the reception, I had assumed there would be no problem. No one at any point indicated there would be any issue”. He is confirming that he asked the MP for <Affiliation DbId="214497" Type="2">Surrey Centre</Affiliation> to go. He did not expect there would be an issue, because the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> calls him “Jas”. They are friends. We have seen pictures going back several years. Mr. Atwal said that the Prime Minister and him had a nice chat years ago in his Hummer on a visit to British Columbia.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5315372">At the press conference, Mr. Atwal also confirmed he had been to India several times. This was not a magical trip where he was first granted entry; he had been there several times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315373">This is what Mr. Atwal's lawyer said at the same press briefing. He stated, “He basically went to this occasion, put his name in, he assumes he was vetted appropriately, he has not hid who he was, he has not changed his name.” The lawyer for Mr. Atwal confirmed that Mr. Atwal asked an MP to go, and assumed his name would be vetted by both the MP for <Affiliation DbId="214497" Type="2">Surrey Centre</Affiliation> and by the Prime Minister's Office.

              <ParaText id="5315385">The Indian government is insulted by this, and it should be. It knows where the invitation came from, because the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s own MP has admitted to the invitation. Jaspal Atwal, who asked for the invitation, has admitted it was the Liberal government. The <Affiliation DbId="229209" Type="4">foreign affairs minister</Affiliation> has admitted it was the Liberal MP, the Liberal government is causing this scandal.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5315386">Now let us look at this smokescreen story that came out of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office through a civil servant I respect. Mr. Jean has had a great career for Canada and I am upset that officials in the Prime Minister's Office have sullied his reputation by forcing him to go to the media to concoct a story. Here is what CBC wrote after attending this briefing by the national security adviser. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315387">After speaking to Daniel Jean, it wrote, “A senior government official with knowledge of the prime minister's security protocols suggested...rogue political elements in India may have orchestrated [the] embarrassing invitation” of a would-be political assassin to a formal dinner with the Prime Minister “in an attempt to make the Canadian government appear sympathetic to Sikh extremism.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315388">That CBC story was what the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office was hoping to get by sending Mr. Jean out to speak. Let someone who advises on top national security issues go out and create an alternate story to the one the MP for <Affiliation DbId="214497" Type="2">Surrey Centre</Affiliation> was already accepting responsibility for. I would suggest that is contemptuous of Parliament. That is knowingly sending a senior official to brief the media to create a parallel story to explain the Atwal invitation at a time when their own MP was taking responsibility for it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315389">Now we have a situation where Mr. Atwal, who asked for the invitation, the MP for <Affiliation DbId="214497" Type="2">Surrey Centre</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="229209" Type="4">foreign affairs minister</Affiliation>, and the Indian government are all suggesting the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s story of the Indian conspiracy theory is a sham. That should trouble all Canadians because it has not only eroded our relationship with a close friend; it has embarrassed Canadians throughout our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315390">As parliamentarians, our role here is to hold the government to account. When we are impeded in doing that, our privileges are fettered, they are obstructed, and Canadians by extension are being kept in the dark. The <Affiliation DbId="214300" Type="4">public safety minister</Affiliation> in his famous elevator press conference suggested that it was okay for the national security adviser to brief members of the media and take questions on this conspiracy theory, but that it was also okay for the government not to allow MPs to have that information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315391">I do not agree. That is a breach of my privileges. It is unethical. It is a cover-up. We deserve to ask Mr. Jean the same questions because we have two stories. They both cannot be true and most people globally believe it was the MP for <Affiliation DbId="214497" Type="2">Surrey Centre</Affiliation>. Most Liberal caucus members believe that too. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s preposterous story and the smokescreen, and the human shield he is using his national security adviser as, need to be pierced and we do that here with a vote in the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315392">All we are asking for is the same basic right to receive information and to ask questions of Mr. Jean that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> granted media members. Is that unreasonable when there are two versions of a scandal that we have to ask questions about? As shadow minister, I have to ask questions. Our proposal is a modest one. If the Liberal government whips and votes against this motion, I think we will be spending a lot more time with you, Mr. Speaker. The good thing is that I like you a lot, because we will be here a lot.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315393">However, it is a sign that the Liberals hold Canadians and Parliament in contempt and that this is a cover-up. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has the chance of showing it is not a cover-up. Make his official available to the public safety committee. We have Canadians appear all the time. If they are willing to send that person out to the media to deflect attention away from an embarrassing trip, they had better be prepared to give the opposition the same opportunity to ask Mr. Jean those questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315394">The government was elected and still uses the phrase “open and accountable”. Today, the Conservatives are going to make the Liberals accountable.</ParaText>

It was the advisers who provided that information. Even though I did not like the fact that $1.2 million was being spent for a car to go to India and even though I had a problem with it, I did not challenge the civil servants who made that decision. Now I suspect had I done that, the very member who just spoke would have been standing in this place saying, “No way do we want that civil servant to be called.” However, because he is now in opposition, now he wants civil servants to be called.</ParaText>

I remember as a cabinet minister seeing Mr. Fadden, our national security adviser to Prime Minister Harper, being a sage counsel to the prime minister. We never saw him doing press conferences.

It is already the world's seventh largest economy, and projections are showing that it would be the third largest by 2030, barely more than a decade from now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315432">For these reasons and others, India is a priority market for Canada. It is Canada's seventh largest export market and 14th largest for imports. In 2017, two-way trade of goods between Canada and India totalled nearly $8.4 billion, almost double the amount we traded a decade ago. More than 1,000 Canadian companies and educational institutions are currently doing business in India, and 400 actually have a physical presence in the Indian market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315433">Our service exports have grown significantly over the last five years. Canada's institutional investments, especially those made by our largest pension funds, have also been growing rapidly, and are now estimated to exceed $15 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315434">There is so much more we could do. Exports to India totalling $4.2 billion represent less than 1% of Canada's total exports worldwide. In today's ever-changing connected global economy, Canada can only prosper by expanding markets for its companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315435">True success in building strong and lasting commercial relationships demands sustained effort and long-term commitment from all stakeholders, whether government, business, or civil society, using a framework of formal structures and informal networks, or a new generation of economic agreements and extensive people-to-people links. This is all the more true when it comes to developing a mutually beneficial commercial relationship with an emerging economic power such as India.</ParaText>

These included a commitment from Indian companies to invest close to $250 million in Canada, leading to the creation of more than 5,800 good, well-paying middle-class jobs for Canadians. These investments are made by global innovation leaders who have confidence in Canada and understand the long-term advantages of doing business here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315442">There was a commitment from Canadian companies to invest close to $750 million in India. As is often the case with Canadian investments in India, a significant portion of this amount will go toward large projects aimed at earning long-term, stable income for Canadian investors and pensioners. In addition to the increase in direct company investment, the overall level of investment from Canada's institutional investors and largest public pension funds has surged in recent years, further demonstrating the wealth of opportunities that exist in India. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315443">There was a commitment to provide opportunities in business for women. Reflecting one of the imperatives found in budget 2018, Canada and India will work together on initiatives that help women in both countries build thriving businesses by providing new access to funding, talent, mentorship, and potential customers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315444">There was an agreement to increase the level of creative collaboration between Canada and India. The cultural sector has huge potential. It will create good jobs in the creative sector, among other ways, and potentially help grow Canada's film industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315445"> There was an agreement to increase people-to-people ties even faster through education. India is Canada's second largest source of international students, with an estimated 124,000 holding a valid study permit for six months or more at the end of 2017. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315446"> Canadian universities and colleges are very active in India, and increased collaboration in education stimulates increased people-to-people ties, encourages joint research and development projects and spurs entrepreneurship and innovation in the decades to come. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315447">There was a renewed emphasis on fostering innovation ties between Canada and India. There is an immense demand and enormous potential for innovative solutions whether in agriculture, food processing, skills development, financial technology, transportation, health sectors, clean tech, and aerospace. Canada has a long tradition of finding these innovative solutions, and is ideally suited to filling this demand from India. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315448">In conclusion, Canada is, has been, and always will be a nation that depends on international trade and investment to prosper. Trade and investment are critical to Canada's prosperity, fuelling economic growth, supporting good jobs at home, raising living standards, and helping Canadians provide for their families with affordable goods and services. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5315449">As Canada challenges itself to retain and advance its place among the world's most progressive, innovative trading nations, the strength that comes from collaboration cannot be overstated. This government has invested billions of dollars in helping Canadian workers and innovative businesses become world leaders in their fields. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315450">We have also recently agreed to sign a trade agreement with Pacific rim countries through the comprehensive progressive agreement on the trans-Pacific partnership.

This represents over one-half of the world's output of goods and services, and demonstrates the critical importance of pursuing, with renewed vigour and negotiations, trade and investment agreements, especially with countries such as India.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315452">As reinforced by the success of our expanding economic and commercial relationship with India, Canada is quickly becoming the bridge between Asia and the rest of the world, one that will offer business unprecedented access to new market opportunities. Now is the time to increase our global investment and partnerships, and make the most of this opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315453">Trade keeps our economy open, dynamic, and competitive, and helps ensure that Canada continues to be the best place in the world to do business. We must emphasize to the world that Canada remains open for business, and is committed to expanding international trade and investment. India is and will remain a very significant part of that commitment.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5315462">Mr. Speaker, that is absolutely correct. When one is the government, there is an obligation to do what is best for the Canadian people. In this case, it is having a debate about the opportunities the Indian market affords Canadian investors and the opportunities for India to trade with Canada. Let us also not forget the fact that we have much in common. Although India is a world away, literally, both countries are democracies with vibrant, multicultural societies. We have values we share. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315463">Our government has been focused on trade, whether it is a free trade agreement in the Asia–Pacific region or with Europe, which brings real, concrete results. It would really be a hope that instead of partisan debates that will not benefit Canadians in any manner whatsoever we could focus on those things that will produce good jobs for middle-class Canadians, currently and for generations to come.</ParaText>

Even more important are those hundreds of relationships that were established. There were four ministers and 16 MPs. We had a whole team meeting with business leaders and political leaders establishing those relationships. How do they put a value on all that hard work, which was laying the foundation for economic relations going forward?

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5315471">Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315472">I want to talk about how the diplomatic corps relies on our government to protect it and to serve our best interests abroad. I am very proud to have been at Global Affairs Canada for close to a decade and a half. I served as deputy head of mission, not once but twice, in fact, so I have a bit of experience in this. I am very proud to have been the chargé d'affaires in El Salvador for two years, at our embassy in San Salvador, as well our deputy consul general in Dallas, Texas. I am very proud to have had this experience.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315473">The golden rule of diplomacy is one thing and one thing only, and that is to do what one's government asks one to do. That is what one is there to do: what one's government asks one to do. This is in fact a fundamental part of our training in foreign affairs in the diplomatic corps. Humility is a very big part of this. I will give two examples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315474">The first one is when I was receiving my accreditation in El Salvador. This was very exciting for me. A motorcade took me through the streets of San Salvador to the presidential palace. I went up the stairs of the presidential palace, and I took my place beside the ambassador to be accredited. The presidential aide came to me and put his hand on my shoulder and said, “No, always behind the ambassador.” That was a lesson in humility, the humility that diplomats face in serving their nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315475">The second example was when I was negotiating the CA4 trade agreement. This was something that was very important for its impact on Canada in terms of pork prices and sugar prices. I prepared very hard for this. I took my communication from the classified computer at the time. I prepared my notes, and I went to visit the minister of trade. I approached the minister of trade. I showed up in my navy suit. I was there prepared to represent Canada as a proud and humble diplomat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315476">Frankly, the minister of trade took my papers and looked at me like I was a school girl, and she said, “You tell your government we will get back to them in two weeks.” Again, it was a reminder of my role as a diplomat for the Government of Canada. I was simply there to serve a function. I was only there doing what my government asked me to do. Nothing more, nothing less.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315477">The peril in this as a diplomat is that, unfortunately, diplomats must wear what their masters give them. This is not always good. Sometimes it can be a trick. Diplomats can be so excited when they understand that a minister is coming to visit. They prepare the best hotel and the best restaurants. They make sure that they know the linens the minister likes. They make sure that they know their favourite foods. They do all of this, and then all of a sudden, it can be cancelled. It can be cancelled because of the changing priorities of the government. This is possible. I saw this in my diplomatic work in Argentina as well, during the Chrétien era. This is throughout government, indeed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315478">Diplomats must wear what the government gives them to wear. Sometimes it is a cancelled trip. Sometimes it is something much worse. This was the case in the Atwal mission at the event in India. This was something much worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315479">Are members aware of the mission process to compile a guest list for a mission event? It is a complicated process. It is not something that happens lightly, where diplomats just sit down and make a list of their friends and the people they like. All areas of the mission come together to compile this list. That is what they do. Once the list is compiled, it is sent to Ottawa. It is sent to Ottawa for a complete and utter vetting. The geographical desk will go through the list and see if there is anything that could potentially be a threat or an embarrassment to the Government of Canada. After the geographical desk, it will be sent to security. Security should and will vet the list to see if there is anyone or anything that could embarrass the people of Canada, the reputation of Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="30">(1330)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5315480">Is it possible that our professionals at Global Affairs Canada and in our security agencies could have possibly found out this information about Mr. Atwal prior to this event? I think it is very possible. If so, why would the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office, which certainly would have been made aware of the attendees at the event, not do anything in an effort to stop this terrorist from showing up at this event? Were they aware that this was happening, and if so, why did they not stop it? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315481">Unfortunately, this has left an absolute, horrible outcome for the Government of Canada, for the public service, and for diplomats all around the world, and this is why. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315482">First of all, there is the absolute embarrassment of knowing that a terrorist is an official guest at an event at which the Government of Canada is present. As a diplomat, I could not handle the shame. It would just be too much.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315483">Second, I would be wondering what the other guests at the event thought about a terrorist being at the event. Would any of these guests go to future events of the Government of Canada and the missions of Canada? I am not certain that they would if they would be in the company of terrorists. This is something they would definitely be hesitant to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315484">Also, this would impact the reputation of diplomats in the foreign service and among their colleagues. Diplomats would wonder if their colleagues thought they were the ones who had this terrible lapse in judgment and invited a terrorist to an event at which Canada was present. We talk in the foreign service about the actions of our colleagues and what they are doing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315485">What are the diplomatic impacts of this? Will we be able to get meetings with local ministers? What are the trade impacts this will have? What are the consular impacts because we had a terrorist at our event? It was a complete diplomatic embarrassment for our public service, for the diplomatic corps, and for Canada. How this mistake will affect mission contacts is a very important question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315486">The government has talked all week in question period about how it supports our public service and stands up for it. This incident sure made it a lot harder for diplomats to do their jobs because of the lack of credibility and oversight. Why would a government that says it supports its public service, that says it supports its diplomatic corps, allow an error like this to happen? That is not a government that supports its public service and its diplomatic corps.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315487">How will this affect Canada on the world stage? Other nations will be looking at this in regard to trade decisions, consular decisions, and interactions with Canada. This is a diplomatic tragedy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315488">I should also say that it affects how diplomats feel about their country and how they feel about the government. Great leaders will always take responsibility, and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the government did not take responsibility, and in doing so, failed their diplomatic corps. I cannot imagine the conversations in the corridors in New Delhi. I am certainly glad I am not posted there right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315489">In closing, as a former diplomat, I know that diplomats put their trust in elected officials to guide them and to protect them, and the government failed. The government did not guide its diplomats and its public service. It did not protect its diplomatic corps. It did not protect the people at the mission in New Delhi. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315490">That is all diplomats ever do. They do what a government asks them to do.</ParaText>

Tomorrow, is it going to be a different civil servant, and then two weeks from now another one, because those members have some issues with which they do not necessarily agree with the minister?

It is entirely appropriate for us to be told how this could have happened. From a security standpoint, the Prime Minister's wife was put in close proximity to a convicted terrorist. This cannot be taken lightly. It makes perfect sense to me that the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security should look into what happened. To that end, the committee members want to speak with the most non-partisan person possible, someone who can give them the answers they are looking for. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5315503">Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak to this important motion today. It is important because in my riding, like many rural ridings across Canada, trade is the lifeblood of our economy. Trade is facilitated by building strong interprovincial and business relations. When our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> creates diplomatic incidents, he undermines those relationships, and consequently, trade suffers. This point leads into my final comments, which will be about the disturbing actions of our Prime Minister, who seems content to throw the reputation of his own Liberal members, and members of our professional public service, under the bus to protect his own skin. These are not the actions of a leader. This is shameful behaviour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315504">It goes without saying that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s recent trip to India was a diplomatic disaster. This tour has undermined the confidence of the Indian government that Canada can be depended upon as both a trading partner and a trusted ally. The Prime Minister went to India with a trunk full of colourful costumes, ready to show off his dance moves, but he failed to do his number one job as Prime Minister: to advance Canada's interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315505">Pulse farmers in my riding of Sturgeon River—Parkland and across Canada are suffering because the Liberal government failed to negotiate a deal on tariffs with India. Consequently, the prices for lentils have dropped significantly, and Canadian farmers are finding themselves increasingly shut out of global markets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315506">The increased tariffs on lentils announced after the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s trip illustrates his complete inability to get the job done. Prices are down for lentils across Canada, and India, one of Canada's top export destinations, continues to slap new tariff and non-tariff barriers on our world-class products. I see the impact of this in my riding. Farmers, including members of my family, are losing out because the Liberal government has failed to deliver serious and meaningful action on this critical trade issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315507"> Furthermore, on the issue of fumigation, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> failed to gain an exemption from the Indian government that would prevent the use of an environmentally destructive chemical on our crops, a fumigant that is not required in Canada. Why was our <Affiliation DbId="214302" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture</Affiliation> not doing the hard negotiations in the backrooms while the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his taxpayer-funded entourage posed for selfies with extremists? Since the Liberals have failed to gain Canadian farmers access to the Indian market when it comes to lentils, how can they be depended upon to ensure that Canada's liquefied natural gas resources get to market? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315508">The Indian economy is undergoing rapid reforms that will require the use of cleaner fuels in order to meet its climate change and economic growth goals. Currently, many impoverished families in India spend hours every day gathering biomass fuel that wreaks devastation on forests and burns even dirtier than coal. Biomass pollution harms the health of women and children. Canada has a solution, natural gas, or as we in Alberta call it, God's gas. Canada's environmentally responsible natural gas can provide the low-carbon intensity to power India's economic expansion. It will also provide the clean, reliable fuel that will ensure poor families have healthier air in their homes. India needs Canada's natural gas, but the government has failed to secure deals necessary to ensure that Canada and India can benefit from this mutual exchange.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315509"> Let us look at the record of this trip. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took 20 members of the Liberal Party on this taxpayer-funded junket and photo-op tour. What do they have to show for it? Supposedly, there is $1 billion in investment, but when looking closely, it becomes apparent that 75% of this investment involves Canada investing in India. Only a few short weeks later, the President of France announced 16 billion dollars' worth of deals with India and was even met at the airport by the Indian prime minister, not exactly a proud moment for Canada, as we struggle to attract foreign investment while this Liberal government relentlessly raises taxes and increases red tape.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315510">What else did the Liberals achieve on this trip? Recent media reports paint a disturbing picture of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s entourage. A Liberal member of Parliament argued with security officials tasked with defending Canada's embassy so that he could cut in line and sneak a few friends into a party. They drank the bar dry of Crown Royal, and succeeded in angering Indian officials who patiently waited in line. This sort of <I>Animal House</I> behaviour belongs in a dorm room, not on international trips meant to highlight Canada's serious commitment to our relationship with India.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315511"> It appears that the priority of this vacation, I mean diplomatic visit, was for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to show off his fancy costumes and dance moves. His reckless disregard for Canada's international reputation and the security of the delegation resulted in a convicted terrorist being invited on the trip, a terrorist who was convicted of attempted murder against an Indian politician while on Canadian soil.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5315512">What kind of message does this send to our ally when we invite on our delegations those who have promoted extremism and violence against the state of India? I know Canadians would not take kindly to a foreign government inviting advocates of separation in Canada, least of all violent separation, and yet that is exactly what the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315513">To make matters worse, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> failed to take responsibility for the actions of his team. Real leaders understand that they have command accountability for the actions of those under their leadership, but this Prime Minister has once again abdicated that personal responsibility. He laid the blame on everyone, from one of his own Liberal members to the supposed actions of the Indian government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315514">I can certainly understand why the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is frustrated. I am sure he truly believes he is a far superior prime minister to Stephen Harper, yet globally the evidence continues to mount against him. That frustration does not excuse his conspiratorial accusations that somehow it is the Indian government that is responsible for this disastrous trip. Even if there is a shred of truth to the Prime Minister's outlandish claim, surely it would make the best diplomatic sense not to make this claim publicly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315515"> Now we have an important ally accusing our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of making baseless accusations. It is bad for India and it is bad for Canada, and yet the Prime Minister has recklessly gone ahead. It will take a new government to restore that trust.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315516"> It is apparent that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> places priority on his own image and not the best interests of Canada. By parading his national security adviser in front of a select media audience, he has chosen to use the non-partisan professional civil service as a shield for his own incompetence. When parliamentarians and Canadians ask for the same privileges that the media received, the Prime Minister refuses to allow his national security adviser to have these claims tested before committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315517">It is clear to me that the national security adviser has been used by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to deflect from his embarrassing failure, and that is one of the great shames of the government. Despite the Liberals' claims to support a non-partisan professional public service, they are all too ready to use and abuse public servants to advance their own partisan ends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315518">Just a few years ago, I had the opportunity to watch as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi disembarked from his plane on the tarmac in Ottawa. This important visit from the leader of the world's second most populous nation and one of the fastest-growing economies in the world highlighted the respect held by India for Canada. A few years ago, the Liberal government declared that Canada is back, but now the Prime Minister of India could not even be bothered to meet with our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> when his plane landed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315519">The contrast is illuminating. Under our serious Conservative leadership, international leaders came to Canada and respected our prime minister. Under this incompetent <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, we have become the butt of international jokes, snubbed when visiting our most important allies. The only thing that will restore the trust for Canadians and for the Indian government will be a new government.</ParaText>

Given Canada's own strong global bonds and priorities, there is clear potential benefit in collaborating with India in many areas. As many Canadians clearly appreciate, India is the largest and most influential state in south Asia. It is the key actor in its immediate neighbourhood, with complex and important relationships with neighbours like Pakistan and China. It also plays a key role in Asia as a whole in its strategic interactions, especially, but not limited to, in the Indian Ocean region.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5315554">The reality is that the water crisis runs in tandem with the climate crisis. As we operate in a state of cognitive dissonance, we all know that the climate crisis is real. Measures are being taken by the government but they are not close to enough to avoid the climate crisis.</ParaText>

Along with my colleagues behind me, what we predicted was a return of the long gun registry to Canada, not just through the back door, as in the new reference system where every non-restricted firearm will need a reference number and be tracked by the registrar, but also deliberately handing through the front door a copy of the old firearms registry data to the province of Quebec.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5315599">Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for the patients with rare disorders and their family members who came to Ottawa this week to meet parliamentarians and attend the Rare Disease Day conference held by CORD, Canada's national network for organizations representing all those with rare disorders. Their message was clear. We need to improve access to treatments for the 2.8 million Canadians affected by a rare disorder.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315600">The Canadian approval process for rare disease treatments or orphan drugs has been called a “Kafkaesque nightmare”. Fewer than 60% of orphan drugs make it into Canada, and only one in three Canadians with a rare disorder can access the treatments he or she needs. The federal government is failing to recognize that orphan drugs and rare diseases are complex issues that cannot simply be rolled under one umbrella regulatory review.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315601">Therefore, I call on the <Affiliation DbId="233811" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> to introduce the orphan drug framework that was completed by the previous Conservative health minister, Rona Ambrose. Canadians with rare disorders need this vital framework to address the current challenges and, ultimately, to help improve and save their lives.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5315808">As I rise, I would ask that this be done today in two ways. In the first part, I would like the Chair and his office to include my speech from the opposition day motion today, because the elements I expressed in my speech are germane to the privilege motion I brought saying that my privilege as a member and shadow minister has been breached or fettered by the refusal of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to allow Mr. Jean to appear before committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315809">I am supplementing additional information for your consideration, Mr. Speaker, because today the Liberal members of the public safety committee once again refused to allow Mr. Jean to appear before them to answer questions and provide evidence with respect to the India conspiracy theory that Mr. Jean previously provided to select members of the press gallery. The additional reference from this presentation is once again the denial of the right of the standing committee to have Mr. Jean before it to give all members the ability to do their job unfettered with the information required.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315810">With respect to that, I would like to add my submission of reference to the decision of Speaker Parent from November 1999, where there was a contempt suggestion by a member with respect to his privilege being breached. It is germane to this case because that case related to employees of the government who had information that a member needed to perform his duties as a member of Parliament. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5315813">In this case, Speaker Parent decided against the member. However, the situation with Mr. Jean can be distinguished, because in that case Speaker Parent said that it involved an access to information request and there was no proceeding of Parliament impacted by the inability of members to access information required, which is their privilege. In this case, the vote today by Liberal members at the public safety committee, the consistent refusal by the <Affiliation DbId="214300" Type="4">public safety minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to provide Mr. Jean to a standing committee of Parliament to provide the same information he provided to members of the press gallery, is obstructing a proceeding of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315814">Also, the other proceeding of Parliament impacted by this obstruction is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s repeated references to the conspiracy theory and the suggestions that Mr. Jean, a leading public servant, has given to provide an alternate theory about the Jaspal Atwal invitation. In my speech today, I read into the record the report from <I>CBC News</I> that stated that Mr. Jean, who was later identified but was an unnamed official at that point, said that the invitation itself was part of an Indian government conspiracy vis-à-vis the Prime Minister's trip to India. That information was provided to members of the media, and the government continues to obstruct members from having the same rights as members of the press gallery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315815">If the information is being provided to the press gallery, which reports on public affairs, there is no way the government could suggest it is confidential or in some way secret. The national security adviser could not provide sensitive information to members of the press. If it was provided to them, we are entitled to it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5315816">To distinguish the Parent decision from 1999 involving Minister Eggleton, I refer you, Mr. Speaker, to the refusal today, obstructing a parliamentary committee in its ability to call a witness, a senior official of the Canadian government. The other parliamentary proceeding which distinguishes the Parent decision is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s repeated references to Mr. Jean's conspiracy theory and discussions to the media in question period. Therefore, our inability to probe and analyze that response by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> by calling Mr. Jean to committee also violates my privileges and all of our privileges as members. </ParaText>

I was at the point of discussing the Rohingya crisis and the Canada-India relationship with respect to the plight of the Rohingya. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315827">Several local organizations in my riding, including the Islamic Society of North America and the Association of Progressive Muslims of Canada, are justifiably alarmed over the treatment of ethnic and religious minority groups in Myanmar. Canada, India, and the international community at large cannot stand idly by as this situation continues to destabilize and innocent Rohingya lives are put at risk. We do not want a repeat of what happened in Rwanda or Darfur.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315828">In addition to its regional importance, India is also a major actor globally, with a strong and influential presence in the United Nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization, the Non-Aligned Movement, the ASEAN Regional Forum, the Commonwealth, the G20, the BRICS International Forum, and other important elements of global architecture.

              <ParaText id="5315830">The two leaders agreed to strengthen bilateral and international co-operation to address climate change and secure a clean energy future, for example in commitments to promote the implementation of the Paris agreement. They urged research institutions and industry in both countries to collaborate to promote greater use of solar technology, acknowledging that renewable energy is a pathway to a low-carbon and more sustainable energy system. The two prime ministers also agreed to add renewables and energy efficiency to the agenda of the regular Canada-India ministerial energy dialogues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315831">On peacekeeping, the two leaders affirmed the benefits of co-operation to provide an effective response to global challenges. In that context, they stressed the importance of integrating gender perspectives into peace and security activities and interventions in line with the international women, peace, and security agenda, including prevention of conflict-related sexual violence. Canada has a long history in peacekeeping, while India has long been one of the top contributors to the United Nations peacekeeping operations, so there is much that we have done and can do to co-operate bilaterally, for example on training.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315832">The national security challenges facing Canada and India are different in type and in intensity, but they have many factors and many elements in common. Thus, enhanced co-operation between our two countries where interests overlap is another area of potential benefit.

An estimated 1,000 Canadian companies are active in the Indian market, of which 400 have a physical presence in our country. Despite this presence, there is a palpable sense that Canada-India trade could and should be higher than it is now, given that our mutual trade and investment numbers are low relative to the size of our respective GDPs. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5315861">Mr. Speaker, thank you for giving me the opportunity to have a say in this debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315862">The answer regarding the invitation in India is already quite clear. The invitation should have in fact never been extended and, as we have said many times, when the existence of the invitation was discovered, we withdrew it immediately. Another point: we have full confidence in Canada’s security advisors and diplomatic advisors, who consistently act impartially in the best interests of Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315863"> The opposition raises the importance of ensuring that parliamentarians are kept informed of security issues. On that, we absolutely agree. We agreed when former national security minister Anne McLellan introduced Bill <Document DbId="2131708" Type="3">C-81</Document> in 2005 establishing a national security committee of parliamentarians. This bill died on the Order Paper when Stephen Harper’s Conservatives took office in 2006. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315864">We agreed when former Liberal MP Derek Lee introduced a similar bill in 2007, when our colleague from <Affiliation DbId="213979" Type="2">Malpeque</Affiliation> did the same in 2009, and when the member for <Affiliation DbId="213894" Type="2">Vancouver Quadra</Affiliation> did so in 2014. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315865"> Each time, the Conservatives opposed the idea that parliamentarians of all parties and of both Houses should have access to secret information, and that they be kept informed of national security issues in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315866">Fortunately, as my colleagues know, Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22, An Act to establish the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians and to make consequential amendments to certain Acts</Document>, received royal assent in June 2017. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315867">Then, in November, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> made it official by saying that “[i]n our system of responsible government, there is no substitute for scrutiny by parliamentarians.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315868"> I am pleased to say that the committee is now in place. Its mandate is to review any matter relating to national security for all government departments and agencies. It will be supported by an independent secretariat headed by an executive director, who will be appointed shortly. The committee will be composed of eight MPs and three senators, all of them holding the highest security clearances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315869"> It is now the appropriate vehicle for parliamentarians to thoroughly review and report on certain national security matters. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315870"> The committee is able to analyze the work of a wide range of government departments and agencies involved in security and intelligence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315871"> Establishing this committee closed a loophole in our national security accountability framework. Before, Canada was an outlier in the Five Eyes alliance, since it was the only one not to have such a committee. However, establishing this committee has made Canada a transparency and accountability leader since our committee of parliamentarians has access to ongoing national security and intelligence operations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315872"> By contrast, our committee’s Australian equivalent may only conduct statutory reviews or consider their agencies’ spending and administration. It must obtain a minister’s order to review other matters. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315873"> In our case, if the committee believes that a national security matter warrants review, it may simply do so. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315874"> In the United Kingdom, the committee must obtain a memorandum of understanding from the Prime Minister in order to review matters that go beyond the work of the three British agencies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315875"> Our committee, with its distinctly Canadian design, has a much broader reach than those of two of our important foreign allies, who also have a Westminster-style system similar to ours.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315876"> I was pleased to witness the various debates during all the readings and to see how thorough a review it was given by the standing committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315877"> The expert consensus is that this new committee strengthens the accountability and effectiveness of Canada’s national security and intelligence system. Bill <Document DbId="9057418" Type="3">C-59</Document> will further strengthen it by establishing the national security and intelligence review agency. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315878"> Since the current government took office, Canada has made great strides in national security transparency and accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315879"> All that is to say that when I hear the opposition insist that parliamentarians should have access to security information, I cannot help but contrast the Conservative decade with the past two years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315880"> The Harper government repeatedly rejected the principles of transparency and accountability when it came to national security. The current government acted to bring in significant transparency, openness and accountability with respect to national security. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="5315896">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be joining the debate at this hour, because so far I have been listening to a whole bunch of deflection and different subjects being brought up. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315897">Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="213957" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation>, my dear colleague from Ontario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315898">As I see it, there are only three possible scenarios. I am going to go through them, and explain what they are. Mostly, I am going to explain why the public safety committee has to be allowed to meet Daniel Jean.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315899">The first scenario that is possible, and has been floated by the government, is that agents of the Indian government, from, I guess, a Tom Clancy novel, somehow managed to invite Mr. Atwal at some point. He got to the high commission to enjoy wine, food, and drink at the expense of taxpayers of Canada. This notion was actually floated by the national security adviser, and confirmed by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in the House of Commons during an exchange with our leader.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315900">The second scenario is that this was an honest mistake by the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="214497" Type="2">Surrey Centre</Affiliation>. That is a notion that has been floated by the <Affiliation DbId="214300" Type="4">public safety minister</Affiliation>, by the <Affiliation DbId="229209" Type="4">foreign affairs minister</Affiliation>, and by the member himself both outside of this House and to the media.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315901">There is a third scenario available, which is that this was a purposeful act by the Government of Canada to include Mr. Atwal, on purpose, because of poor judgment, incompetence, and oversight. Hanlon's razor says never to ascribe malice when incompetence is sufficient. Any one of those could fit within that third scenario. That is not the one the government uses often, but there are only three scenarios available.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315902"> There are only three possible variations on what happened. We have gotten the first two scenarios quite often. We want Mr. Jean to appear before the public safety committee, and tell the committee members exactly what he told the media, and then answer questions. I believe in parliamentary supremacy, that this House of Commons, through its committees and through this chamber, can exercise complete oversight over government. That is our role here. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315903">Members of the backbench are not members of the government. They are members of the government caucus. Just because they support the government on most votes, nearly all votes at times, does not mean they have to defend every single action. This is one of those cases where they should exercise their better judgment as members of Parliament, and demand that Mr. Jean appear before the public safety committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315904">We want the same information that was given to the media by the same person who gave it to them, for him to appear before the committee, and give it to members of Parliament. It has never been a question about Mr. Jean's professionalism, his ability, or his competence. Mr. Jean is a long-time public servant. That is the excuse given by the <Affiliation DbId="214300" Type="4">public safety minister</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315905">Seemingly, members of Parliament are not allowed to meet competent, smart, professional members of the public service at a committee of the House of Commons that is supposed to keep them accountable. That is seemingly the excuse floated by the <Affiliation DbId="214300" Type="4">public safety minister</Affiliation>, that this man is so professional that he just cannot force himself, and we cannot ask him to appear before a committee. It seems it is right for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of this country to hide behind his national security adviser, and then refuse to allow him to appear before the public safety committee of the House of Commons. That seems like an aberrant, impossible argument to make. It defies logic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315906">I would like to meet this gentleman. I would like to meet him at the public safety committee, in fact. I think he is a professional, so why am I not allowed to meet him? That is the government's position. The Government of Canada is saying this man is so professional that I am not allowed to meet him. That is absolutely ridiculous. Perhaps he is calling right now, asking if he could speak to me. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315907">This is a gentleman who was the deputy minister of foreign affairs, and according to media reports, he was pushing the Government of Canada to sign an extradition treaty with the People's Republic of China. This is a gentleman who later was appointed as the national security adviser, and was in Beijing during the inauguration of the extradition treaty, the transfer of offenders treaty. I would love to meet him at the public safety committee if only members on the Liberal side would allow for it to happen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315908">I do not know why the government caucus members want to protect the frontbenchers on this. I do not know why they are protecting the executive council on this. Government ministers are impeding the ability of the House of Commons to hold public servants accountable.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="40">(1540)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5315909">Public servants do not exist in the nether, on some superior plane to the House of Commons. Parliament exists in that plane. We exist here as a board of directors of the Government of Canada. It is supposed to be us holding it accountable, not the other way around. However, that is seemingly the argument being made by member after member on the opposite side of the House, and it is wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315910">The excuses that have been given by the government brings up a Yiddish proverb. Many members always wait for these. The proverb goes like this, “He is mediocre—not near to a wise man, not far from a fool.” We would like to ascertain which one he is the closest to. We will not be able to do that without Mr. Jean appearing before the public safety committee. Those three scenarios only have three logical end results, or three logical conclusions that we can draw. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315911">If the information was good enough for the media where Mr. Jean floated a conspiracy theory worthy of a Tom Clancy novel, that rogue agents in the Indian government participated somehow in this invitation to Mr. Atwal, and confirmed by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in the House of Commons in debate, then it is good enough for members of Parliament to hear the same information at committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315912">In fact, that is exactly what a member of the media tried to tell the <Affiliation DbId="214300" Type="4">public safety minister</Affiliation> during the elevator pitch with members of the media not too long ago. If that is not the case, and if the information is so sensitive, then by all means, there are procedures at committee to deal with sensitive information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315913"> I have had the privilege of sitting on the foreign affairs committee and the finance committee where sensitive information has been dealt with, like FINTRAC. There is a procedure to consider sensitive information where we can clear the room of members of the public if we need to. There are mechanisms for that to be done at committee, but it is still done at a House of Commons committee by members of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315914"> We were sent here by residents of our ridings, by the citizens of Canada, duly elected all of us, to hold the Government of Canada to account, which is the front bench. It is the public servants who work, or the professional public service, we are always told. I agree, and I want to meet him at the public safety committee. I want to hear what he has to say. I want members of the opposition caucus to be able to question Mr. Jean, and ask him about the contents of that media briefing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315915">Lastly, if the information and the answers to be provided during the question period section at committee are so sensitive that only the national security intelligence committee of parliamentarians can see it, as the <Affiliation DbId="214300" Type="4">public safety minister</Affiliation> said during his elevator pitch, then why was that information given to the media in an open Q and A session? Why did Mr. Jean float the conspiracy there? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315916">If the information or content was so sensitive that only this particular committee of parliamentarians could then review it, then why did he say those things to the media? It is illogical; it is irrational. It does not make sense. The argument does not hold. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315917">Therefore, the only correct thing to do, the only logical thing for the House to do, is to exercise its supremacy over the Government of Canada, pass this motion, and demand that Mr. Jean appear before the public safety committee. There is no other way out of this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315918">The Parliament of Canada holds the Government of Canada to account, not the other way around. If Mr. Jean is as professional as the government believes, and as I believe, then I want him to appear before the public safety committee and answer questions from all parliamentarians, opposition members as well as members of the government caucus who may also have questions to ask him. He is obviously contradicting one of the scenarios I mentioned at the beginning, or at least two of the scenarios, one from the <Affiliation DbId="214300" Type="4">public safety minister</Affiliation> and one from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> on Mr. Atwal. It can only be one of them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315919">The only way we will find out, the only way the people of Canada will find out, is if we pass this motion, and get to meet this professional national security adviser at the public safety committee. I look forward to a yes vote from all sides of the House.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5315920">Mr. Speaker, I come back to what I was talking about earlier on with this being a slippery slope. When we start ordering the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to tell people to appear before committee, professional public service employees that we have, where does it end? Do we then start telling others to appear next week, if we question their judgment and question their input? Where does it end? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315921">I do not feel as though it is entirely appropriate to order the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, through a motion of this House, to instruct an employee of the federal government to appear before committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315922">Does the member at least not see that setting this kind of precedent, and opening this kind of door, would not have more problems down the road if we start to cherry pick who we are going to call from time to time, or who we are going to order from time to time via the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5315925">This is absolutely no different. The motion does not call for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to appear. It calls for his national security adviser to appear. The slippery slope is when a public servant is sent to do his bidding, and then he runs over to a bus or, potentially, 20 buses afterwards, behind him.

              <ParaText id="5315927">However, the Liberals are forgetting that it is not the first time a national security adviser, or a former one, would have appeared before committee. In 2010, the same committee, despite the heckling, had a report on comments made in the media by Mr. Richard Fadden. He came before committee, clarified remarks, and then a report came out. It is not that complicated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315928">I know there are concerns about what it means for issues of national security. The member has quite eloquently pointed out the ability to go in camera and things like that. To just talk about the lack of respect for public servants is ludicrous. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315929">I sit on that committee. This morning, who did we have? We had representatives from CSC and the Canadian Armed Forces. Two weeks ago, when the <Affiliation DbId="214300" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> was there, we had the deputy minister, folks from the RCMP, and folks from CSIS. This is a regularly occurring thing.</ParaText>

What a missed opportunity. International trade missions like the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s trip to India are very important. They give us an opportunity to build better relationships.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315953">The previous Conservative government put in a lot of hard work to strengthen ties between Canada and India. We signed the Canada-India social security agreement. This agreement helps facilitate the flow of people between Canada and India. We also announced the new Canada-India research centre of excellence. This centre of excellence will build stronger bilateral research ties and create valuable learning opportunities while generating positive economic and social benefits for both countries. Now we see the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> would prefer to eat with his celebrity chef friend, see elephants, and play dress-up instead of getting results and strengthening diplomatic ties. All this has proven to us is that the Prime Minister does not take his job seriously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315954">Going back to the facts, the government of India, a Liberal MP, and the convicted attempted murderer in question have all refuted the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s theory that Atwal was planted at the Prime Minister's event in India. This is contrary to what was said in a media briefing arranged by the Prime Minister's Office, where a government official suggested that Jaspal Atwal's presence with the Government of Canada's Indian delegation was linked to factions within the Indian government. The inference was that the Atwal affair was a result of rogue Indian elements sabotaging the Prime Minister on the world stage, not a lack of due diligence by the Prime Minister or his office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315955">I support the motion today and hope that the government does the right thing for Canadians and the relationship we have with India. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> must be responsible and instruct his national security adviser to appear before the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security to provide the committee the same briefing he gave journalists on February 23, 2018, and that briefing must take place in public no later than March 30, 2018.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315956">Canadians deserve to hear the facts and be provided with the evidence. By continuing to support a conspiracy theory that is not supported by any proof and has been met only with denials by those allegedly involved, the PM is making allegations without substance. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has a responsibility to properly represent Canadians and their interests. The Prime Minister is failing to be honest with Canadians. It is important that he clears up the confusion about the Atwal affair. Canadians deserve answers. If he has evidence of moves to sabotage Canada's reputation, he must present it. Otherwise, he should take responsibility for this massive failure of an international trip.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5315967">Mr. Speaker, I am going to share my time with my dear colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214129" Type="2">Elmwood—Transcona</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315968">As a member of the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security, I am pleased to speak today on the Conservative motion to invite Daniel Jean to provide the same briefing that he gave to the media, following the chaos of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s trip to India.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315969"> As I informed my Conservative colleagues on the committee when attempts were made, and as I informed the media, I will say again today that I support this motion. I do believe that parliamentary committees obviously have a responsibility to ask questions and obtain, at a minimum, the same information given to the media. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315970"> Regarding the national security advisor, concerns about having him brought before a parliamentary committee are legitimate, given how his appearance before a committee affects the ability of people who, inevitably due to the nature of their work, must work in the shadows. I understand the concern, and I take it very seriously. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315971"> However, first we need to acknowledge that greater transparency is being asked from these agencies and those working there. That goes without saying. After all, these individuals have their hands on the switch that controls very important powers that have an impact on Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315972"> Given what has been said in the media, these individuals have significant influence over public opinion and even diplomatic situations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315973"> We saw it in 2011 when then-CSIS director Richard Fadden made controversial public comments about a situation involving Chinese spies. Without rehashing all the details, he was called before the same committee that had reported on the matter and had called for his resignation. The Liberals supported the report then. There was not just Richard Fadden; there was also a Privy Council official. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315974"> So we do not need the Liberals coming here and shedding crocodile tears about the reputation of public servants, since these officials must be held to account. We agree with the Conservatives on this. Of course, we must always be careful to ensure that these calls for accountability do not end up preventing people from doing their jobs. That is understood. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315975"> However, when someone in this position feels free to make public statements and in any circumstances—there is nothing more public than commenting to the media—, I believe that it is entirely appropriate for us to feel free to have this individual appear before a parliamentary committee to provide essentially the same information. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315976"> I must say we understand that it is problematic given a trip that went nowhere. Ultimately, we are talking about an eight-day trip, which is already a very long absence for a prime minister, since in the meantime other matters are not being taken care of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315977">It would have been nice if they had come back with something concrete to offer us. They did not discuss the chickpea tariffs, nor did they discuss the issue of innovation and technology development, in which India is a key player. They did not discuss certain human rights situations in the region. We have learned that very few meetings were held during the eight-day trip, considering the number of staffers who accompanied the Prime Minister and the number of days they spent there. I think there were more photos than meetings during this trip. That is the problem. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315978">We understand that there is a certain superficial aspect to a prime minister's foreign trips. The Prime Minister is representing Canada abroad and wants to project a positive image. That is fine. I have no problem with that. However, once the photos have been taken and the nice family moments are over, which, again, are things I have no problem with, then it is time to get to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315979">The results leave something to be desired.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5315980">Furthermore, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> seems to have been using his imagination when he talked about a $1-billion investment in Canada, because it was closer to $250 million. That is not a paltry amount, but it is only a small fraction of $1 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315981">In short, the trip was a disaster from start to finish. I have been an MP for seven years, and never before have I heard so many comments about a prime minister's trip abroad. It goes to show just how much this trip has captured the public's attention. The Liberals missed a golden opportunity to talk to one of the world's largest economies about the many important matters that require discussion, including not just economic issues, but all kinds of geopolitical issues as well, such as human rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315982">Getting back to the question of the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security, the <Affiliation DbId="214300" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> raised a possibility during the infamous media scrum that took place under some rather crazy circumstances, and again when he appeared before the committee. He talked about the new committee of parliamentarians as a possible avenue for examining this matter. This poses a number of problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315983">First of all, this committee was only recently formed. It is still finding its bearings and only recently began its work and determined its mandate. Its mandate exists, but it will be further clarified by the work it does. We cannot start throwing every file that makes the headlines at this committee. There is a lot of work to be done. Ever since the bill passed and the committee was created, barely one year ago, every time something winds up in the news, the minister says that it does not matter because the committee of parliamentarians can study it. That is worrisome for several reasons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315984">First of all, the committee needs to be free of all partisanship. If it starts looking at really politically controversial issues or only the ones raised during question period, it will never get anywhere and we will never have the rigorous reports we expect to get, like Commissioner O'Connor's report on the Maher Arar affair. Those are the kinds of recommendations we want to see from the committee of parliamentarians. It should not be examining every controversial issue that makes the headlines. That might be the case one day, but not in this instance. I am not saying that it would be inappropriate for the committee to examine these files, because in some cases, it would definitely be entirely appropriate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315985">Secondly, there is the fact that the government is using the minister to try to get out of sticky situations. The same thing happened when CSIS was taken to court for workplace harassment, discrimination, homophobia, and islamophobia. When I asked the minister about it, he initially told me he would not comment because the matter was before the courts. Then, to get out of being accountable, he said that it was not so bad since the committee of parliamentarians was going to look into it. No matter how important it may be, the committee cannot constantly be used to get out of being accountable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315986">The Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security has a mandate to address certain issues after all. It is not always appropriate to address the issues of the day, but in this case, it would be quite appropriate to devote an hour or two to a little meeting so that we can hear something that has already been said in public. There are some questions that we as parliamentarians have every right to ask, questions that Canadians have. No matter our opinion on the veracity of such statements, they remain important and the hon. members do have a responsibility in this regard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315987">Earlier, I was heckled by a Liberal member when he told me that the members had voted to adjourn debate and reject the motion moved by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="214522" Type="2">Charlesbourg—Haute-Saint-Charles</Affiliation>, because national security issues are sensitive. Let's call Mr. Jean before the committee, and once he is there, if we deem that the discussion must remain confidential because it deals with sensitive and confidential matters that concern national security, then we can decide for ourselves. There is no need to use this secrecy as an excuse for flat out refusing to have him testify. In conclusion, I would say that this trip was a disaster, and the government missed opportunities to advance some important issues.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5315990">Mr. Speaker, they did not have the courage to vote it down. They adjourned debate because they did not even want to talk about it, and it was the Liberal majority on the committee that voted it down. I think we know where that comes from. At least when the Conservatives were in power they had the decency to empower the parliamentary secretaries to say that the PMO was going to run what happens at committee. Instead, now it happens in more subtle ways. However, at the end of the day, it is all the same thing, whether it is a punch in the face or a knife in the back. In this case, it is a knife in the back and not wanting to go ahead with what is going on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315991">Here is the problem. I have the utmost faith in the public service. This notion that we do not is ludicrous. If there truly is nothing wrong, and if we have faith in Mr. Jean, then let us have him before the committee, and he can repeat the statements that were made to the media. That is the minimum. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315992">If this were some side conversation someone had overheard, or had these statements been obtained through some kind of subterfuge, I would understand. However, what I find extremely problematic, and it is a habit the Liberal government has gotten into, are comments being made through the media, the most public forum possible, and not having those comments made to a parliamentary committee. That includes technical briefings on legislation done for the media before they are done for MPs, and things of that nature.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315993">Even if the Liberals want to reject the motion, they should at least have the courage to explain why, when the debate comes up, and not adjourn debate and run away with their tails between their legs.</ParaText>

I do not always like it because those agencies certainly have transparency issues, but that is a debate for another day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5315996">I want to set that aside for now. Those people exercise good judgment in deciding what they can and cannot say publicly. Most of the time, that is exactly why they are in those jobs. In answer to my colleague's question, it may be that the Liberals themselves doubt Mr. Jean's ability to appear before the committee and exercise his judgment about what he can and cannot say publicly. Lastly, I said it before in my speech and my response to the Liberal member and I will say it again and again: the media is the most public forum there is. When politicians are considering whether a statement is appropriate, they ask themselves if they would be comfortable saying it on the record. That often happens automatically. If Mr. Jean felt it was appropriate to say those things in a press briefing, I think he can say them to parliamentarians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5316001"> I can understand that the Liberals may feel this is a coincidence, because they obviously do not put a lot of thought and planning into their relationship with foreign governments, or the India trip would not have happened in the way it did.

              <ParaText id="5316002">Therefore, it is hard to believe that a government that typically thinks about its actions, even though we may not always get that here, would just as a matter of coincidence have that significant of a raise in tariffs shortly after a visiting head of government, who it is obviously quite angry at. I do not think most governments are as flippant as this one in their interactions with other government. Therefore, I do not take that to be a coincidence at all. That was one consequence of the trip.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5316003">Then we were told that we are supposed to be really happy about the trip because it was great for trade. However, the trip itself had a $500 million trade deficit. The Liberals talked about $750 million' worth of investment being drummed up. I may not have all the numbers right on this, but I think the number was $750 million or it might have been a billion dollars.</ParaText>

                <Affiliation DbId="214129" Type="2">Mr. Daniel Blaikie:</Affiliation> Mr. Speaker, it was a billion. My thanks to my colleague for helping a guy out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5316006">It was a billion dollars, $250 million of which were investments from India to Canada, $750 million of which were Canada to India. That seems like an unlikely outcome for a successful trade mission from Canada to India. I could understand if the Indian government planned a trade mission to Canada and went home with those numbers. Their citizens may be pretty pleased and feel their government did a good job. However, that is not the case. It is the opposite. A $500 million trade deficit on the trip itself and a significant raise in the tariffs for Canadian chickpeas appears to have been the outcome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5316007">Therefore, this is why Canadians are frustrated with the trip. I think it is why most of us, and certainly the Liberals, would like to put it behind us and forget about it, except that another negative outcome of the trip was that it needlessly had a really negative impact on the relationship between the two governments because of a lack of vetting. We are trying to figure out where exactly that misstep occurred, when a person convicted of political violence in India was invited to an event with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. That goes beyond embarrassment. It is an international incident.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5316008"> Compounding that was the fact that instead of owning up to a mistake from within either the Liberal Party or the Government of Canada, it was still not exactly clear where the error occurred or who was really in charge of the trip, or whether the trip was for political purposes, or official government business. Part of the problem is that we do not know. The person was allowed to get into that event.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="5316009"> It is important to emphasize that the national security adviser was not ad-libbing or deciding to get into a political debate on his own, causing an international incident. It is very hard to believe that. I say that because I want to reinforce the fact that this is not about calling into question the integrity or the judgment of the national security adviser. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> then repeated the idea publicly that somehow it might have been a conspiracy of the Indian government to embarrass him. He really should have taken responsibility for what was an error either on the part of the Liberal Party or the Government of Canada. We are trying to sort that out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5316010">It is not just that it was a kind of fluffy extended photo op instead of a real government business trip. It is not that it ended up having negative trade consequences for Canada instead of positive trade consequences. It is that coming out of that trip there was an international incident and a government that has not taken responsibility and has floated at least two competing accounts as to what happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5316011"> On the one hand, the Liberals have an MP who says that he takes the blame, that he is responsible, that it is on him. On the other hand, they have a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> saying that it might have been a conspiracy of the Indian government. The way he chose to spread that theory was by sending his national security adviser into a media briefing and pushing the story out through that briefing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5316012">In order to move on from this trip, people need to know what happened, how, and who was responsible. An important part of that story is better understanding what happened at that press interaction between the national security adviser and the media.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5316013"> This motion simply asks to get the national security adviser in front of the public safety committee so that conversation can happen and parliamentarians can get a better sense of what exactly was said, reported, and discussed at that meeting. It would give members an opportunity for cross-examination and to ask some questions in case the account in itself is not exactly clear and there are some extant questions, which is also appropriate, so we can get a sense of what really happened and then put this whole sordid affair behind us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5316014"> Unfortunately the Liberal government refuses to enable that final step to get to the bottom of what happened and to have some measure of accountability for what ultimately was very poor judgment on the part of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to go out and promote that theory without any real evidence and without even really standing by it. If we are going to make that kind of allegation about another government, we have to be sure of ourselves. We had better also be darn sure what the point of doing it is and what it is we are trying to achieve. In this sense, the whole thing kind of ties back to the original problem with the trip, which is the purpose never was really clear. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5316015">That lack of clarity might have played a part in why the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> shot his mouth off about a conspiracy in the Indian government instead of being precise about what he wanted to communicate and how. It has all the dressings of poorly managed political crisis management of “Oh no, we made a terrible mistake. We don't want to take responsibility for it. We don't want to own up to it, so what are we going to say in order to try and divert opinion?” This is where we get signs of a Prime Minister who, in a lot of ways, does not have the experience and the tact to conduct himself appropriately on the international stage. Throwing another government under the bus without being willing to back it up is something that is problematic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5316016"> There are times when the Canadian government may well take on another government, but I do not think that was the point of the trip. I do not think that was what he was trying to do. I do not think he substantiated those claims, and he does not seem to care to substantiate those claims. It is a real mixed bag. </ParaText>

We oppose provisions like that, not trade.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5316040">Let us call this what it is. On that fateful Sunday night, the Prime Minister's Office decided it was going to throw the non-partisan national security adviser out in front of the media to provide a briefing that somehow rogue elements of the Indian government had some part to play in this disastrous trip. Imagine the contempt of putting a non-partisan national security officer in front of the media to float this conspiracy theory. We later found out the Indian government has denied this.

              <ParaText id="5316070">The story I am about to tell is a simple one. It is the story of a Prime Minister who had been living in the clouds for a few years, travelling here and there, around the world, taking selfies with world leaders and others. The Prime Minister, who was really proud of his performance abroad, made quite an impression with his haberdashery and hair. However, it seems that the Prime Minister had little to say on his many trips. One day, the Prime Minister, emboldened by his previous trips and the fawning press coverage he had earned purely on the strength of his image, and certainly not on his substance or any achievements made for Canada, decided to take a really big trip to a really big country, a country with which Canada does a lot of trade, a country that also has a great deal of history and culture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5316071">Our Prime Minister decided to bring along his family, his ministers, his MPs, and all kinds of people. That is where danger lurks. When we become overly ambitious, and believe we are a little too good for the position we hold, we become less careful, surround ourselves with a large entourage and, at some point, unfortunate things happen, as they did.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5316072">We can look at this trip through the eyes of the international press. A French President made a similar trip to India soon after our Prime Minister. I will quote the March 14 edition of <I>Paris-Match</I>: “Unlike Nicolas Sarkozy, who, in 2008, spent only 35 hours in India, Emmanuel Macron took his time. In those three days, the French President made many gestures and declarations of friendship towards India.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5316073">Sarkozy spent just 35 hours. President Macron took his time; he spent three days. Our Prime Minister took eight days. If something had come out of it, if Canadians had benefited, it is not a stretch to say that we would have understood. We would have been happy. Unfortunately, nothing positive came out of it for our economy. Nothing good came out of it for our agricultural sector. Many people characterized the trip as a fiasco.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5316074">That is not all. I want to remind members of what happened during this trip. I will quote another newspaper, <I>Le Parisien</I>:</ParaText>

As the saying goes: when you meet a man, you judge him by his clothes; when you leave, you judge him by his heart. There is no question that foreign leaders have their outfit choices scrutinized when they travel abroad. The Canadian Prime Minister learned this bitter lesson during his official trip to India in February. Draped in many traditional outfits—sparkly ones, at that—[the Canadian Prime Minister] drew the wrath of local dignitaries and the international media was shocked by this Canadian's wardrobe faux pas.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="5316078">The Prime Minister was anxious to change the subject in the international press.

              <ParaText id="5316114">Mr. Speaker, the problem with the opposition members is that they would have Canadians believe that the motivation for this opposition motion is as pure as the driven snow, but Canadians know better. They know the opposition's record when it comes to politicizing public servants. They studied their record very closely. That is why Canadians came to the sound judgment in 2015 to toss that party out of government after having muzzled scientists, after having censored researchers, and after having politicized national security. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5316115">The Conservatives are doing it again right now.

All members recognize that unusual circumstances require additional demands on the part of not just the page staff but the clerks at the table, and particularly those clerks who are calling the votes. We will take that under advisement, and see what we can do to ensure members are getting the adequate support they need.</ParaText>

A convention definitely exists requiring men to wear jackets. Wearing a tie is not mandatory during votes, but wearing a jacket is. I did not notice any transgressions during the last vote, but I will pay attention and make sure that this rule is observed going forward. I remind all the male members to wear a jacket during votes.</ParaText>

Members will know, of course, that this is a public place, and members are free to use their time in the House at their seats as they wish. If they wish to participate in votes, or if they wish not to, that is absolutely their choice, but it is not for other members to decide, except in the course of these decisions that are rendered, how they should comport themselves in the House, aside, of course, from the use of unparliamentary language. I do not see anything unparliamentary in particular on this point of order. We will carry, on and I thank the hon. members.</ParaText>

There have been occasions when Members have attempted to bring some matter to the attention of the Speaker in the course of a vote (after the Members have been called in and before the result is declared), and the Chair has declined to interrupt the voting process in favour of hearing the point of order or question of privilege. More recently, however, points of order related to the recording of the vote were heard and addressed during the voting process. Immediately after the announcement of the result of a vote, Members who were unable to be in the Chamber for a vote sometimes rise on a point of order to explain how they would have voted had they been present.</QuotePara>

However, the votes continued, because the government was allowed to designate another cabinet minister to move the motion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5318452">Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. In fact, you referenced, during this marathon voting, an earlier review of the big green book. The difference is that this point of order was raised at the first possible instance, immediately in response to the motion, when the vote was concluded, and as a result, I think you have to hear all submissions on it, because it is properly before you at this time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5318453">However, it also has a significant distinction from the earlier precedent spoken to, where the issue was not raised until a much later sitting. It was not raised at the time the incident occurred, so it did not satisfy that part of the test of being raised at the first possible instance. It was a very different situation from what we face here.</ParaText>

The <Affiliation DbId="229526" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons</Affiliation> suggested that the <Affiliation DbId="214327" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Heritage</Affiliation>, who was present for the entirety of the putting of the question, could simply be replaced as the seconder.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5318555"> The situation is similar to one in December 2012, when it was noticed the next sitting day after the taking of a vote that the minister moving the motion was not present as indicated when the Speaker put the question on a government bill to the House.

              <ParaText id="5318577">Mr. Speaker, I asked a question about veterans because I wanted to find out whether the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Liberal cabinet intend to keep the election promise they made to restore lifelong pensions. Unfortunately, at the time, all they gave me was another general answer. They said that more details would follow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5318578">They have given us those details, but unfortunately, veterans will have to wait until April 1, 2019, to get what they were promised during the election campaign. That seems like a long time to me. I would like to remind the parliamentary secretary that the election campaign took place in 2015. The Liberals will not fulfill their promise until 2019 and even then there will be a choice to make. The Liberals seem to want to save money at the expense of veterans by failing to implement the promised measure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5318579">I think that the government's attitude toward this situation is totally unacceptable. During their careers, veterans became accustomed to discipline and structure, and when they are faced with such an unbelievable amount of government red tape, they always get discouraged. It saddens me that veterans always have to lug around three or four binders full of information about their case. They always have to fight to have their sacrifices recognized, even though they gave up dozens of years of their lives to serve our country. I will never understand this government's attitude.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5318580">It is high time the government kept its promises and perhaps it could do better than waiting until a year from now do to so. It is time to do some housecleaning. We need to stop forcing veterans to fight against their own government and against the country that they served with a pride and willingness rarely seen in other occupations. The government is making them wait and is not addressing the real problem, which is the endless red tape at the Department of Veterans Affairs. These men and women deserve better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5318581">I would therefore like the parliamentary secretary to show that she is prepared to find solutions so that veterans are never again kept waiting and are shown more respect. The government has to stop keeping veterans waiting because many of them are suffering.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5318582">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for her question and for serving our country. I sincerely thank her for all that she did when she was a member of the Canadian Armed Forces.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="5318583">This government takes our commitment to the members and veterans of the Canadian Armed Forces seriously. We have invested significantly in programs and benefits to support Canadian Armed Forces members and veterans and their families since October 2015.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5318584"> In December, the <Affiliation DbId="233812" Type="4">Minister of Veterans Affairs</Affiliation> and I announced a new package, the pension for life, to compensate Canadian Armed Forces members and veterans for service-related pain and suffering. It replaces the disability award with a monthly benefit, adds a new additional monthly benefit payment for pain and suffering, and consolidates several existing financial benefits into one. This streamlined package will enhance Canadian Armed Forces members' and veterans' well-being and will empower them to better manage their transition to post-military life.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="5318585">I would like to summarize this new plan for the benefit of the House. First, the pension for life gives back the option of a monthly benefit payable for life in recognition of and in compensation for the pain and suffering associated with a service-related injury or illness. This benefit will replace the disability award and will be called pain and suffering compensation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5318586">Soldiers and veterans will be eligible for a tax-free monthly benefit of up to $1,150, or they can combine those monthly payments into one lump sum. Our soldiers and veterans will be able to choose the option that works best for them and their families.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="5318587">The additional pain and suffering compensation is a further monthly, tax-free payment for veterans that recognizes the struggles they go through in trying to re-establish themselves in post-military life following service-related severe and permanent impairment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5318588">The income replacement benefit supports veterans who experience barriers to re-establishing themselves after service as a result of a health problem resulting primarily from service. It consolidates six financial benefits into one, providing up to 90% of a veteran's military salary at the time of release. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5318589">The pension for life package is an integral part of the veterans' well-being initiatives this government has introduced. They include the caregiver recognition benefit, the veteran emergency fund, the veteran and family well-being fund, removal of the time limits on vocational rehabilitation, the veterans' education and training benefit, and expanded access to military family resource centres across Canada. All of these come into effect in less than two weeks. This government is also investing in a centre of excellence on PTSD and related mental health conditions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5318590">This holistic approach empowers veterans and their families to make the choices that make sense for them, streamlines the delivery of service, helps to enhance veterans' well-being, and helps them transition successfully to life after service. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5318591">When it comes to our veterans, we can never be fast enough. We know that this is going to take time. We just spent 22 hours voting in the House on a budget bill. Unfortunately, it will take time to do this right, and therefore, we are looking forward to putting the pension for life in place on April 1, 2019.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="5318592">Mr. Speaker, my colleague said in her speech that veterans will have to wait until April 1, 2019. I still do not understand why they have to wait. Why that date? Why will it take a year for the Liberals to keep a promise they made during the election campaign? Why were they not already prepared to do this?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5318593">My colleague's speech did not mention any action or measures the Liberals plan to take to address all the red tape veterans have to cut through time and time again. It is a real problem. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5318594">For veterans who have a pension for life but cannot access it because they go crazy trying to deal with the department and bureaucrats, that is extremely problematic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="5318595">It is important to remember that these men and women are often accustomed to fighting with their hands and the physical skills they have learned. These are men and women of action. They are not specialists in dealing with government red tape—</ParaText>
