              <ParaText id="508688">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to table four petitions today on behalf of the hard-working families of Hamilton Mountain. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508689">These families are increasingly recognizing the existence of a prosperity gap in Canada. They do not feel that they are benefiting from the economic growth they keep hearing about. Of course, they are right as we know and the numbers are backing them up. Not only is there a growing gap between the right and the poor but there is also an alarming erosion of economic security for middle class families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508690">To that end, hard-working families have talked to me about the over 200 commercial bankruptcies that are happening every week in Canada, for a total of more than 10,000 bankruptcies a year. We know that this has a huge impact in Hamilton.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508691">Many of these bankruptcies leave behind employees who are owed back wages, benefits and pension contributions. It is estimated that as much as $1.5 billion per year is left owing in back wages and benefits to employees. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508692">These people have worked hard all their lives. They have played by the rules and all they want from their government is a little bit of fairness. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508693">To that end, the petitioners are calling upon Parliament to ensure expeditious passage of my bill, Bill <Document DbId="2162573" Type="4">C-270</Document>, which would ensure that workers would be first in line in the case of a commercial bankruptcy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="508694">Mr. Speaker, my next petition again is on behalf of these same hard-working families. We know that a decade after the major reforms to the employment insurance program were enacted, it is even more difficult now to qualify and the benefits are less generous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508695">EI has been repeatedly cut since its high point in the mid-1970s, most recently in the early 1990s, and today only about 4 out of every 10 unemployed workers collect regular EI benefits, down from 80% in 1990.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508696">The NDP has introduced eight bills that target more than 12 elements of the EI Act, including the removal of the waiting period, the 66% benefit rate as well as the length of the benefit period. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508697">To that end, hard-working families in Hamilton are asking this House to enact the legislation introduced by the NDP and reform the EI program, so that it will properly support working Canadians who are out of work.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="508758">The injustice that we are debating here today is one that is of prime importance. I want to illustrate the lengths to which the government will go to get elected, to get seats and to be absolutely deceptive in all ways, shape and form. This is the crux of it for us in our province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, Mr. Danny Williams, had written every leader asking for certain commitments and intentions of how they would govern the country. He asked about the equalization formula and the response from the then leader of the opposition and the now <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and leader of the Conservative Party was that his government would remove non-renewable natural resource revenue from the equalization formula to encourage the development of economic growth in the non-renewable resource sectors across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508759">That does not say anything about a cap. It does not say anything about going to either the old system or staying on the new system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508760">Interestingly enough, in the last budget the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> had said that side deals with provinces undermine the principles of equalization.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508761">Let us try to follow the logic here. They were saying to Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia that they could either go to the new system or stay on the old system but for every other province and territory they need to go to the new system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508762">If that is the case, if Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia decide to stay in the old system, we have the same situation: two provinces now under a different equalization formula; a side deal supported by this party after saying unequivocally that side deals undermine the principles of equalization. It is one step forward, two steps backward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508763">Let us go to the deception once more. The following are some of the headlines in recent days from the moves made by this budget and the Conservatives' idea of fixing the fiscal imbalance and answering some of the concerns of the Newfoundland premier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508764">“N.S. to take big hit in program funding if it opts out of new federal formula”, is the headling from the Newswire in Halifax. Another headline is “Tory MP accuses Saskatchewan premier of lying as government defends budget”. Not only have the Conservatives deceived them, they are attacking them for saying to them “Where is your commitment?” Not only have they abandoned the premiers, they now have decided to victimize them as well.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="508842">Mr. Speaker, the issue today is the enactment of a promise, keeping one's word. Very simply put, on January 4, 2006, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, then leader of the opposition of the Conservative Party of Canada, specifically wrote to the Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador saying, in unequivocal, unconditional language, that he would remove 100% of non-renewable natural resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508843">During the election campaign, particularly during the heat and the debate of a campaign, sometimes when a position is put forward which seeks favour and enjoys favour with the electorate, it often results in votes. In many cases that is exactly what happened. In fact, the Newfoundland and Labrador seat count went up for the Conservative Party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508844">Now what we are finding today is that honour, that promise, that respect to the people of Newfoundland and Labrador is not being adhered to. This goes beyond the Atlantic accords. Anyone who understands anything about non-renewable natural resources will also conclude that the promise would have entailed and enacted and encompassed Voisey's Bay nickel, Labrador and Wabush iron ore. It would have taken into account Baie Verte gold. It would have taken in all non-renewable natural resources within the province of Newfoundland and Labrador and across Canada, including the provinces of Saskatchewan, Manitoba and others.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="508848">Mr. Speaker, it is very interesting to listen to the Liberals opposite try to create a parallel universe based on the facts as they would wish them to be for politicking purposes, but not on the facts as they are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508849">The members opposite rightly point out that their government signed Atlantic accords with the provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia. This was a problem for them because all of a sudden some provinces had side deals, which completely destroyed the fairness and the equality of this program. Nevertheless, the Liberal government, for political purposes, entered into these agreements and our government said that we would honour those agreements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508850">This is the crucial point, and I hope members opposite are listening to this, because this is a fact that may assist them as they continue to pontificate and mislead through the day. Here are the facts that they should be keeping in mind.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="508856">In fact, the previous government put together a blue ribbon panel, the O'Brien panel, to examine the equalization system, which had been badly broken and bent by years of Liberal mismanagement.

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508858">The former Liberal finance minister said, “The main focus of this panel will be how to address non-renewable resources”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508859">The panel did its work. The panel, set up by the Liberals, reported and our government fully accepted the recommendations of the O'Brien panel. We have now fixed the equalization system according to the recommendations of this independent, unbiased panel set up by Liberals.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="55">(1055)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="508860">Because of the fixing of the system, the equalization program has been somewhat enriched. Now Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia are saying that the accords gave them one thing but this new system might give them something better. That may be true. What did our government do? Our government told those provinces that they had a choice. They could continue to operate under the accords which they negotiated and signed and which we are fully honouring without any exceptions, or if they wished, they could move to the new system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508861">What could be fairer than that? What could possibly be fairer than saying they can get the agreement they fought for and signed, or they can move into the new system. It is up to them. They have a choice. I might add that other provinces do not have a choice, but those two provinces do have a choice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508862">Let us talk about the new system that has been set up. The new system actually gives a choice to the provinces that are in the new system, which Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia could be if they want to be. The new system says that for every year, two calculations will be made for the provinces. One calculation will be based on the O'Brien recommendations that 50% of non-renewable resources will be included in the formula. That is what O'Brien said was fair and reasonable and right, so we will calculate on that basis. Where a province wants to have 100% exclusion of non-renewable resources, we will make a calculation on that basis too. Provinces can choose which one they want. They will get the best of those two calculations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508863">Actually, the provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia get three choices. They can choose to have equalization under the Atlantic accords, which are fully respected and open to them and honoured by this government, or they can choose the O'Brien formula based on 50% inclusion of non-renewable resources, or they can choose the best, if it is the best, of 100% exclusion of non-renewable resources. Yet, dishonestly I say, members opposite are trying to say that somehow the provinces that are given not one choice, not two choices, but three full choices are somehow being unfairly treated. That is so untrue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508864">Not surprisingly, when provinces are given a formula, there is going to be some unhappiness. The leader of the Liberal Party himself said just in January of this year that every province is arguing about getting shortchanged by Ottawa in one way or another and it would be difficult to make “all the premiers smile”. Did he ever get that one right. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508865">The leader of the Liberal Party also said that we need to have a clause that says whatever is the formula of equalization payments, a province that received equalization payments cannot see its fiscal capacity going above the fiscal capacity of a province that does not receive equalization payments. There we go. It is called a cap. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508866">That is exactly what the O'Brien panel said and what the new equalization fix put in place by our government delivers. This is a program to make sure all Canadians get an equal level of services, but provinces that are not receiving equalization cannot have a lower ability to provide their citizens with services than provinces that do receive equalization. It has to be fair for everybody. It has to be the same standard for everybody, whether it is called a cap or a same standard, or whether it is called equality or fairness. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508867">That is a principle that all Canadians get except a few members opposite. Even the Leader of the Opposition gets it. I will read again what he said, “cannot see its fiscal capacity going above the fiscal capacity of a province that does not receive equalization”.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="00">(1100)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="508868">The formula, the equalization program has a standard that all provinces honour because that is fair. Provinces that get money from the equalization program are not going to have a better ability to serve their citizens than those who do not get money from the equalization program. What is there about that that the members opposite who just spoke do not like? Even their leader gets that; even their leader affirms that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508869">We have fixed the equalization system. I might add that here we have a system that has been gerrymandered, skewed and torn up by the previous government that could not make up its mind, could not stick to principles, could not make a strong decision. The Liberals could not do it, so we did it and now they do not like it, even though it is fair, even though we fully honoured the Atlantic accords and even though the new system gives provinces the best-of choice of two calculations. Somehow the members opposite do not get it and they are making trouble simply for political purposes where no trouble should be given. That is completely and utterly unfair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508870">What do Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia get from this enriched equalization program? They get full respect, no changes whatsoever to the Atlantic accords.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508871">The new equalization system makes every single province better off. In fact, we have been criticized for how rich the equalization system is under the new formula. Over $12 billion will now be distributed to the receiving provinces under this formula. If Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador decide they are better off under this new enriched equalization program, they can opt into it. It is their choice. What can be better than a fair choice? Any time they want to during the life of the accord they can move to the new enriched system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508872">I want people in Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia to remember two things out of this debate. One is that the Atlantic accords that were signed are fully honoured and are available to those two provinces with no change whatsoever. The second thing is that we have a new system, a richer system, a system that will allow any province to receive benefits under a calculation that fully excludes non-renewable resources, or under a system which O'Brien recommended, a calculation that will include half of the non-renewable resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508873">That is justice. It is clear. It is fair. It gives the provinces some certainty going ahead as they calculate their budgets, as they decide how best to provide to their citizens important services like health care, education, infrastructure, child care and social support systems for the most vulnerable. That is what the fixing of the equalization system is all about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508874">There are two provinces, one with the highest fiscal capacity in Canada, Alberta, and one with the lowest fiscal capacity in Canada, Prince Edward Island. What do these two provinces have in common? Their premiers are reasonable people. They know a reasonable accommodation when they see it. The premiers of these two provinces, one the newest premier and one the longest serving premier, are very pleased with this budget because we kept our promise to fully preserve the Atlantic accords and we restored fairness and balance to a disjointed system that we inherited from the directionless, knee-jerk government that Canada suffered under previously.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="05">(1105)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="508875">On top of that, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> and this government recognize that a national government has a duty to all of Canada, to every province, every territory and every citizen, to be fair, to be equal and to have the same standards for everybody. This is something the previous government did not get. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508876">It is essential to fairness that the provinces receiving equalization do not have a higher fiscal capacity than non-receiving provinces. That is what the O'Brien panel, which was set up by the previous government, said. It is what Canadians know to be fair, and that is what this new system puts into place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508877">Regarding all the distortion, all the misrepresentation, all the trouble making on the other side, members of Parliament are supposed to make this country work well for everybody. They are supposed to be fair, honourable and upright in the way they disagree. If the members opposite do not like the equalization formula that the Conservatives put into place and think they could do better, though we notice they never said how they would change it, then that is a fair debate. However, to misrepresent what was done, to say that promises were somehow broken when they were kept is completely unfair and deceitful to the people of this country who depend on their members, because their constituents listen to them. They believe their members and trust them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508878">Trust should be placed on the basis of truth, honesty and putting forward the facts as they actually are, not as what members opposite might want them to be so that they can attack a government that has it right for a change, that is keeping its promises and giving provinces not one choice, not two choices, but three clear, unambiguous choices. I hope as the debate continues today that it will be based on the truth. I hope it will be based on what is actually in the budget. I hope it will be based on what is actually before the good people of Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia because they deserve to make their assessment on what is true and actual, not a distortion of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508879">I have tried to be as clear as I can to the House and Canadians about what is really happening: fixing the equalization system, fully honouring the Atlantic accords if the two provinces want to stay with them, fully honouring the commitment to provinces who want to exclude 100% of non-renewable resources, but at the same time honouring the O'Brien panel which spent many months making the best accommodation that can be made for our country for fairness, equality in provision of services to citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508880">This is where we are. We have a good system. It is not a system everyone is going to like because that is not human nature, but it is a system that is true to our promises, true to the choices that we said would be made, and true to fairness and the same standard for everyone at the end of the day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508881">Citizens in Newfoundland and Labrador, citizens in Nova Scotia are good Canadians, Canadians who want a fair deal for themselves and their children and services that they can count on. They want certainty but also to be part of this great country where there is equality for all. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508882">We are glad to honour the deals that were made by the previous government even though they skewed the system. We recognize that but we will still honour them or move into an enriched system that gives an even better deal. That is what we are providing for people in these two provinces and all Canadians. We are proud of it and we hope that it will be supported by everyone.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="508904">Mr. Speaker, I have some respect for the parliamentary secretary. I served on the finance committee with her and I appreciate her work, but she betrays a fundamental lack of understanding about Atlantic Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508905">One of the things that has most offended Atlantic Canadians in the last year goes back to last year's budget documents where the government made it clear how it felt about the Atlantic accord. It suggested that the February 2005 arrangements to provide Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador additional fiscal equalization offset payments sought to address the severe fiscal challenges faced by those two provinces as a result of their high public debt, but were widely criticized as undermining the principles in which the equalization program was based.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508906">The member spoke about previous fiscal arrangements like the Atlantic accord as being gerrymandered. There were other terms that got by me before I could write them down. She later used the terms disjointed and knee-jerk arrangements. That offends Atlantic Canadians and it absolutely shows what the government thinks of the Atlantic accord.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508907">Does the member believe that the Atlantic accord, negotiated between the former Prime Minister and the premiers of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador, was a gerrymandered, disjointed, knee-jerk arrangement?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="508908">Mr. Speaker, the equalization program has a name that should show what should be honoured in this program, namely equalization. The side deals that were negotiated by the former Prime Minister, promised by the former Prime Minister and finally put into place under much pressure, destroyed the equal part of equalization. There is no question about that. The member knows that. It made the program not the same for everyone and removed the same standard for everyone. That was unfair to people right across this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508909">Nevertheless, as I have said repeatedly, we will and do fully respect that because it was a deal that was made, a deal that was signed, and a deal that was fully respected. Now if the leaders in Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia can get a side deal, even though it could destroy the equality of a particular program, no one is going to criticize them for that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508910">However, it must be recognized that national leadership requires that there is no skewing of programs, that the equal in equalization is returned and reinstated because all Canadians depend on this kind of fairness and equality. That is what our government has done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508911">I ask the members opposite, are they against equal? Are they against fairness? Are they against the same standard for all? That is what they have to answer and they are not doing that.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="508924">Mr. Speaker, before expressing the position of the Bloc Québécois, I would like to come back to the motion we are debating. It is the motion presented by the Liberal Party, which reads as follows:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508925">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That this House regret that the party now forming the government has abandoned the principles respecting the Atlantic Accords, equalization and non-renewable resource revenues as articulated in the motion it put before the House on Tuesday, March 22, 2005.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508926">I must say that such a motion was indeed put forward by the Conservative Party in 2005. I completely understand that to some regions in Canada it may appear that the Conservative Party is going back on its promise, with what it has proposed regarding equalization in the budget speech, and that is cause for frustration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508927">I also understand that roughly 2.5 million Canadians, who believed the current <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s promise on income trusts, feel swindled by this government today. I want to remind the House that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> promised during the election campaign not to change the tax rules as far as income trusts were concerned. He did not keep his promise. It is in the budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508928">In this case, as with equalization, I understand the frustration of the people, whether they are from the Atlantic provinces or the western provinces. I also understand the frustration of the pensioners who believed the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508929">However, I must say that in the case of the moratorium—it is more than that, it prohibits the conversion of corporations into income trusts in future—we cannot disagree with the government. This caused a problem both in terms of economic development and of tax avoidance. That said, there could have been mitigation measures, as suggested in the Standing Committee on Finance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508930">As far as equalization is concerned, as I was saying, I can very well understand the frustrations of certain premiers, those from certain provinces in particular. But one fact remains: the equalization formula, even the one in the current budget, is not fair for Quebec. For that reason, the Bloc Québécois cannot support this motion. If we went back to the former principles of equalization, then Quebec would lose a great deal of money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508931">I would remind the House that the old formula would have given Quebec $5.202 billion for 2007-08, while the new formula, which we feel is incomplete, gives Quebec $7.16 billion, which is a difference of $1.958 billion. How could anyone think that the Bloc Québécois would masochistically support nearly $2 billion less in equalization for Quebec? Thus, it is entirely understandable that the Bloc Québécois will oppose this motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508932">I would also remind the House that the government's proposal—we will see how the budget implementation bill will turn the budget announcements into reality—includes either 0% or 50% of natural resource revenues, to be decided by the receiving provinces. At least there is a choice. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508933">I wonder why the government did not propose 100% of natural resource revenues, as the Bloc Québécois is calling for, and will continue to call for, and as the Quebec government, all parties of the National Assembly and the Séguin commission also called for. The provinces therefore have the choice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508934">The 10-province standard means the elimination of the floor and ceiling provisions, which we opposed in the old formula, because it seriously penalized Quebec. In that regard, there is some progress in terms of the fairness of the equalization formula.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508935">The tax bases used in the calculation have been reduced in number from 33 to 5, which we find much more transparent. Quebec's argument was also accepted—and I imagine this is true for other provinces—that property values must be calculated at market rates.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508936">As I mentioned, this is what budget 2007 proposes. This does not fully satisfy the demands of Quebec and the Bloc Québécois. While we now have an equalization formula that is headed in the right direction, it is not quite there yet, and therefore, it is entirely understandable that we will not lose ground or regress to a situation of inequity for Quebec.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="30">(1130)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="508937">What we want is to reform the equalization formula to take into account not only the ten provinces, but also 100% of revenues from natural resources, renewable or not, and to also take into account, as I already said, the true value of property taxes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508938">In our opinion, this would make it possible to increase the overall equalization envelope. In the budget, this overall envelope is currently valued at $12 billion. It would increase to $16 billion in 2007 and 2008. We have made some progress, and I had the opportunity to say so. My Bloc Québécois colleagues also had the opportunity to say so in our reaction to the budget speech. However, a definitive solution to the fiscal imbalance has still not been found. The formula proposed by the Bloc Québécois is the only one that enables equalization to meet its goal of providing recipient provinces with a per capita fiscal capacity equal to the Canadian average.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508939">It does not make sense to have gone with only 50% of revenues from natural resources. One thing that explains the fiscal disparity between Canadian provinces, unfortunately still including Quebec, is the fact that some provinces have oil and natural gas in the ground. Of course I am thinking of Alberta, but also Newfoundland and Labrador. This geological accident explains why some provinces are richer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508940">Take Newfoundland and Labrador, for example. Last year and this year, growth was close to 11%. Why was this? It can be linked to the start of the Hibernia project.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508941">If we do not take this reality into account, the equalization formula is biased, and we are preventing the equalization formula referred to in section 36(2) of the Constitution Act from working. The section states that equalization is meant:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508942">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">—to provide reasonably comparable levels of public services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508943">By not including any revenue from natural resources, equalization does not play the role set out in the Canadian Constitution. I am often amused when I point out to Quebeckers and my colleagues from other parties that the Bloc Québécois is about the only party that strives to ensure that the Canadian Constitution is respected. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508944">In this case, I would point out, equalization plays an extremely important role for the regions of Canada. However, in order for it to play this role, we must look at the whole picture and not just parts of it. The former formula, which the Liberal motion would reinstate, was based on a standard calculated using five provinces. The poorest and the richest were excluded, which had the effect of lowering the national standard or, rather, the pan-Canadian standard—since this House has recognized that Quebec is a nation, I must set the example. It was recognized that the pan-Canadian standard, based on the average of the five provinces, was lower than if all provinces were included.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508945">I would also like to remind the House that, at that point, the real value of property tax was not reflected. This value was determined by rent paid or mortgages paid by owners which resulted in property values of certain provinces being underestimated. As I already mentioned, all this led to Quebec being penalized. It still is because 100% of natural resources are not included in the equalization formula.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508946">A solution for the fiscal imbalance—one which is just beginning to emerge—must have several components. First, we need an equalization formula that works. We need not retrace our steps. We must continue to work towards truly attaining the objectives of the Canadian Constitution, that is transfer payments that will enable provinces that fall below the pan-Canadian standard to have access to revenues that will allow them to reach this pan-Canadian standard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508947">Second, we need transfer payments that meet the needs of the provinces and Quebec.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="508948">As we have said, the last budget did not keep these promises and did not meet the expectations of the education system, particularly with respect to post-secondary education. This is true everywhere in Canada and in Quebec. So there is some work to be done on increasing transfers to the provinces and to Quebec. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508949">To ensure that we no longer run the risk of the federal government making unilateral decisions, we recommend transferring the federal tax base to the provinces and Quebec. The Séguin Commission, the Government of Quebec and all parties in the National Assembly have recommended the same thing. With access to guaranteed, permanent and predictable revenues, Quebec will be empowered to address responsibilities in its areas of jurisdiction independently. Obviously, this applies to these areas of jurisdiction. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508950">There also has to be some control over federal spending power. During the last two question periods, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was asked to commit to negotiations. Unfortunately, I must emphasize that yesterday, the Prime Minister said there would only be negotiations with a federalist Quebec government. That sounds a lot like blackmail to me, and it is unacceptable. If the Parti Québécois comes to power next Monday, March 26, which seems likely, the government will give it the silent treatment. I find that totally irresponsible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508951">Let me review the facts. During question period, the leader of the Bloc Québécois asked the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister </Affiliation>about the federal government's willingness to begin negotiations to limit federal spending power.

              <ParaText id="508956">Does that mean that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> not only wants to select judges and people to be on the immigration board, but he also wants to select provincial premiers, in Quebec in particular? This is totally unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508957">That is why we have to be able to free up some of the federal tax room and transfer it to the provinces that want it—Quebec wants it—in order to avoid this type of blackmail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508958">The best illustration of the fiscal imbalance is that the federal budget was dragged into the Quebec election campaign. Imagine if Quebec's budget had been brought down during the federal election campaign. Would anyone have been concerned during the federal election that Quebec's budget would have an impact on election results in Quebec? No one would have cared.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508959">We can barely balance the books. Last year, Minister Audet had to sell off $800 million of the Government of Quebec's assets in order to balance the budget. This finance minister is not seeking re-election: he must be tired from trying to balance his budget. The auditor general, Mr. Breton, said that there was some accounting sleight-of-hand and that the budget had probably not actually balanced. This had no impact, which shows that the federal government has too much money in relation to its responsibilities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508960">Accordingly, we would like taxpayers to pay just enough taxes to the federal government that it can handle its responsibilities, yet pay enough to Quebec that it can handle its responsibilities as well.</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508965">This is in the chapter or part that talks about the labour market program, which, as we know, falls under Quebec's jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508966">What does it mean? This phrase can be found not only regarding education and job training, but also regarding post-secondary education, social programs and child care. It is repeated several times in the budget. These are not federal jurisdictions. The equalization formula is a federal jurisdiction. If the federal government wants to change it, it can. Naturally, we hope it would change the formula in a way that best serves the interest of all Canadians, and especially the best interest of Quebeckers. However, it does not need to ask for permission, as the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> seemed to suggest for months and months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508967">Besides, the Liberal government changed the equalization formula a number of times, to the detriment of Quebec. Based on the wording, we can say that, when it comes to provincial jurisdictions, the Conservative government is reserving the right to spend in consultation with the provinces, but it is not giving them the right opt out from these programs unconditionally and with full compensation. Thus, we still have a centralizing government in Ottawa. Only the paint colour has changed. They talk of open federalism but the reality is, we are dealing with a government that advocates a centralizing federalism. Quebeckers need to know this. If we want to be able to stand up to this government, as we have stood up to other governments, we must have a government that stands up for itself. Next Monday, we must have a Parti Québécois government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508968">As we can see, the work required to resolve the imbalance is far from over. Negotiations must continue, not matter who is in power. The Bloc Québécois will continue to pester the Conservative government and all governments as long as it is in this place. We will remain here until we achieve sovereignty in order to ensure that certain principles are respected and that the Government of Quebec, and the governments of other provinces, will have the financial resources needed to provide viable programs. That is also our hope for the others who share the Canadian political space. This requires accountability. That is found in the quote I just read.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508969">However, when the Conservative federal government speaks of accountability, as did the previous Liberal government, it is referring to the accountability of the provinces and of Quebec towards the federal government. That is not the accountability I have in mind. I am referring to the accountability of provincial governments, of the Government of Quebec, towards their citizens, their voters, in their areas of jurisdiction. In areas of federal jurisdiction, the federal government must be accountable to the citizens of Canadian and Quebec when elections are held. We are not at all talking about the same thing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508970">In addition, equalization payments must be predictable. We are still in a situation where, tomorrow, the government could change its mind and amend the equalization formula or even reduce transfer payments in the areas of health or education. There are no guarantees and, after the election of a majority government,—whether Liberal, Conservative or NDP, and I say this to please you, Mr. Speaker; one can dream, as I always say—such a government could decide to tear up everything we now have in front of us. The only way to ensure that this does not happen is for Quebec to have an independent fiscal capacity, to have control over its revenues, in its areas of jurisdiction, and that means the transfer of tax points to Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508971">Finally, and I do not know why the Bloc Québécois has to constantly repeat this point, jurisdictions must be respected. What I just read from the budget does not respect jurisdictions. Once again, the new Conservative federal government, just like the former Liberal government, wants to control what is done by the provinces, particularly Quebec, including what happens at election time, and that is unacceptable.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="508973">We are talking about equalization. As a member representing a riding, I strongly believe in equalization, which is the distribution of wealth throughout this large country that is Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508974">However, I am surprised to see that non-renewable natural resources, which represent considerable wealth—such as the oil sands development in the west, which is so wealthy that there is a labour shortage—are included at only 50% in the distribution. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508975">We are fortunate in Quebec to have renewable natural resources, but these resources are not included at their full value. Furthermore, the federal government has done nothing to support their development, unlike the development of the oil sands, which is still benefiting from the government's generosity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508976">I am even more surprised when I read newspapers from across Canada. For example, an excerpt from the <I>Edmonton Sun</I> states that, for decades, every Quebec premier has exploited the federal government to Quebec's advantage. I am surprised to see that Canadians who are benefiting from this fiscal generosity and from the wealth of natural resources still feel that Quebec is taking advantage of this system. I would like my colleague from Joliette, who has a good grasp of the entire tax system, to elaborate on this.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="508977">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for his excellent question. In my excitement, I forgot to mention that. First of all, Quebec receives lower equalization payments per capita than most of the other provinces that receive equalization. It seems like a lot, but that is because our population is greater than that of other provinces. Seven million people now live in Quebec. Per capita equalization transfer payments are lower than what most other provinces are getting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508978">Federal government transfer payments to Quebec have risen by 55% from 1993 to 2007. Wow, that is a lot. However, taken together, the other provinces minus Quebec have received 66%. That means that we have received less than the others. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508979">From 1993 to 2007, the federal government's revenues increased by 91%. The reasons for the fiscal imbalance are obvious. My colleague noted, quite rightly, that the oil and gas sector has received huge direct subsidies. From 1970 to 2000, Ottawa gave $66 billion in direct subsidies to the fossil fuels industry—coal, natural gas and oil—and a paltry $329 million to the renewable energy sector, not a penny of which went to hydroelectricity. This means that we paid for our hydroelectricity, we paid for the Hibernia oil sands development project, and now we are being asked to cover the cost of cleaning up the pollution these industries produce. Who do they think they are fooling? We want what we deserve, that is all.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="508980">Mr. Speaker, I want to thank and congratulate my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78635" Type="2">Joliette</Affiliation> for his speech. I have two little questions for him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508981">First, he reminded us of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s comments about the “choice” Quebeckers should make, that according to him, they should choose a federalist party. Does my colleague agree that this very serious? The Prime Minister is quite simply questioning the legitimate choice of a population, a nation, the nation of Quebec. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508982">My second question is similar to the question already raised by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78325" Type="2">Alfred-Pellan</Affiliation>. I will ask it in the following way. I would like to ask my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78635" Type="2">Joliette</Affiliation> whether he thinks Quebec is really in the process of being swindled for the second time, if not the third. The current government keeps giving rather remarkable tax breaks—to oil companies for example—and Quebec, as my colleague just mentioned, is penalized. With this formula option, this calculation of 50% of revenues, it is obviously being penalized on that front as well. As far as I am concerned, we can never say enough about the fact that Quebec is being swindled.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="508983">Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank my colleague for her question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508984"> Yes, indeed, the Conservatives’ attitude is not only disdainful of the intelligence of the Quebec electorate, but also it challenges the legitimacy of the sovereignist parties’ existence. Whether in Quebec City or here in Ottawa, we derive our legitimacy from the democratic process, not from a decision by the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister </Affiliation>of Canada. So when Quebeckers send members of the Bloc Québécois to Ottawa, we are entitled to speak on their behalf, like any other member here. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508985"> This is not the first time the <Affiliation DbId="78744" Type="4">Minister of Labour</Affiliation> has cast doubt on the legitimacy of our presence here. To my mind, this attitude is not only disdainful, but also anti-democratic. Yesterday we saw that the example came from above when we heard the comments made by the Conservative <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508986"> So, yes, I do not think that we have heard the end of the story. Unlike what the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> may have thought yesterday, his little blackmail game is going to have entirely the opposite effect, I can assure you. I have been in touch with some of my fellow citizens and they are up in arms. They will not be told what to do. Now that they have been told they have to vote federalist, a lot of them will choose to vote otherwise, I can assure you. When I say “otherwise,” I mean for the sovereignist parties. As you know we have two in Quebec. So this will have the opposite effect of the one he thought.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508987"> To my mind, going with 50% of natural resources is a poor compromise. It is as if there were a fork in the road ahead and, in the decision as to which direction to take, they headed right for the middle. That is exactly what they have done, but by shortchanging Quebeckers the equivalent of $2 billion this year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508988"> I spoke of the $66 billion in direct subsidies. Of this amount, at least $10 billion came from the pockets of Quebec taxpayers. That they should be deprived in the end of developing these natural resources, which they paid for, is totally unfair in my opinion and we will continue the battle so that 100% of the revenue from natural resources is included in the equalization formula. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508989"> As they used to say when I was young: this is just the beginning, let us keep up the fight.</ParaText>

This debate is about broken promises and a government that has completely betrayed a commitment that the Conservatives made when in opposition, that they made here by voting in the House of Commons, and they made on the campaign trail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508991">For those who are trying to follow the debate, let me make it clear that what we are debating is the Conservative government's abandonment of principles respecting the Atlantic accords, equalization and non-renewable resource revenues as articulated in a motion put before the House on March 22, 2005.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="508992">Without taking too much time to go back, because we have to move forward on this, let me just refer to that motion that was introduced by the Conservatives in March 2005. What a difference an election can make. The motion asked that the House call upon the government, the then federal Liberal government, “to immediately extend the expanded benefits of the recent Atlantic accord to all of the provinces since the existing equalization clawback on non-renewable resource revenues severely curtails the future prosperity of Canada by punishing the regions where the economy is built on a non-renewable resource base”.

              <ParaText id="509023">I welcome the member's reference to one of the declared candidates for the Conservative Party, namely Jane Purves, who made it known she was seeking the nomination to represent the people of Halifax. Jane Purves is a character. She also served very ably as the chief of staff to the premier of Nova Scotia, who actually played a very constructive, positive role in bringing political parties together to fight for fairness for Nova Scotia. I want to give him credit for that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509024">No wonder she is dismayed. I do not know whether she is going to try to put herself forward to say she can represent that party after it has turned its back on them, but I do know that when she declared her intentions to seek the nomination, she said that in Nova Scotia since 1980, in Halifax, people would rather eat lobster shells for lunch than vote Conservative. I can say that they now would be more prepared to eat whole lobsters within their shells for lunch before they would ever vote Conservative in the foreseeable future. I think probably that woman knows that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="509025">Mr. Speaker, on the great island of Cape Breton we have a Gaelic college. I want to recite a Gaelic proverb to the House. This proverb is a very worthy one and needs to be said over and over again: “There is no greater fraud than a promise not kept”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509026">Since the Conservatives have formed the government under the present <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, we have witnessed the reversal of the VIP promise. We have witnessed the reversal of the marine service fees promise. We have witnessed the reversal of veterans first and veterans care motions and the assistive devices deductions promise. We have witnessed broken promise after broken promise. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509027">This is the same <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who, when he was in opposition, rightly criticized the then Liberal government for its broken promises. The Prime Minister was absolutely correct when he was in opposition when he said that the Liberals broke their promises on various issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509028"> Now he is the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of our country and is breaking a very solemn promise that was made by the Government of Canada, with his support, to the people of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador and, for that matter, Atlantic Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509029"> If the people of Canada cannot trust their <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, we are in serious trouble. Politicians in general are held in low esteem when it comes to the Canadian public and the reality is that the actions of the Prime Minister will put us even lower.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509030">It is interesting to note that a very important fellow from Nova Scotia, Mr. Brian Lee Crowley, formerly the head of the Atlantic Institute for Market Studies, AIMS, is now working in the finance department as a visiting chair. A couple of years ago, he warned the governments of the day that there was no such thing as a fiscal imbalance. What he said was that there may be a social and a development imbalance, but there is no fiscal imbalance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509031">We saw the other day the crass opportunity taken by the premier of Quebec. He took a $700 million transfer payment and, instead of putting it toward the concerns that he yelled about for years, such as health and education, the environment, seniors, single moms, infrastructure, training, et cetera, what did he do? He very crassly tried to tell the people that if they voted for him they would get tax cuts. If he can give out that amount of tax cuts, then how can Quebec argue about a fiscal imbalance?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509032"> The fiscal imbalance is a myth. We have a social and development imbalance in this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509033">What an outrage for Atlantic Canadians. The premier of Nova Scotia and the premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, both Conservatives, not New Democrats or Liberals or Greens or whatever, are firmly outraged at what the government has done to their people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509034">But we know why it has been done. It is based on crass politics. The Conservatives did the numbers. They know very well that they can afford to lose a few seats in Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia, no worries, and if they can pick them up in Ontario and Quebec, all the better for them, they think.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509035"> It is unbelievable. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is supposed to represent every Canadian from coast to coast to coast, not certain Canadians within central and, possibly, western Canada. I cannot describe the outrage at the budget of that great province of Saskatchewan and my former home province of B.C.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509036"> It is unbelievable. The government has a surplus of $14.2 billion, which is more than it anticipated, and those members are the same people who yelled at the Liberals for discounting the amount of the surpluses year in and year out, but they have turned around and are doing things in the exact same way themselves. It is unbelievable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509037">Personally I wish we would have an election so we could go to the polls and tell Canadians what the true colours of this Conservative Party are. The first four letters of that party's name spell “cons” and we know what that means. Those members have done that to the people of Atlantic Canada and they have done it very well.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="10">(1210)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="509038">The people of Nova Scotia, the province I represent, are very firm and very clear on what they want to see in a budget. They want to see development assistance. They want to see the accords maintained. They do not want an either-or. This budget is almost like blackmail: if we take this, we will not get that, it is our choice. That is not how we do federalism in this country. It is unbelievable that the Conservatives get away with this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509039">I can assure members that we will be telling Nova Scotians loud and clear, and telling not just Atlantic Canadians but Canadians right across the country, what the government has been up to. This is the crassest form of politics I have seen in the almost 10 years I have been here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509040">We in Nova Scotia are very proud and hard-working people. In fact, many of our young people are across this country working in central or western Canada, helping out those provinces by working hard. Our people are willing to go where the jobs are, but we have asked repeatedly for various things to assist our own provinces. One of them was the Atlantic accord. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509041">Our former premier was Mr. John Hamm. Although he was a Conservative, I found him to be very respectful and dignified and a decent gentleman. With Danny Williams, he fought very hard to get the Atlantic accords to benefit the provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia and, in many ways, to benefit all of Atlantic Canada. He did that on the basis of the solemn promise that those accords would remain intact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509042">Let us imagine this if former Premier Hamm were still here, understanding full well that those accords are now either-or: maybe we will keep it and maybe we will not. That is not how we are supposed to treat our friends. I can understand them treating Saskatchewan and its NDP government that way. I can appreciate the politics of that. But doing that to their own Conservative people in Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia is incredible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509043">I challenge my Conservative colleagues in this House, especially the members for <Affiliation DbId="78823" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margaret's</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="78829" Type="2">Cumberland—Colchester—Musquodoboit Valley</Affiliation>, and <Affiliation DbId="78900" Type="2">Central Nova</Affiliation>, to stand in this House and defend the interests of Nova Scotia. That is what the old Reform Party used to do. It put constituents first, regions second and party third, but that has changed now. Many of those people do not even speak about their regions any more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509044"> In fact, the member from Bonavista-Trinity, up in Newfoundland and Labrador, said today that if he votes against the budget he is out of the party. I remind that hon. member, whom I respect greatly, that he is there to represent those constituents of his province.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="509047">He is not here to represent the concerns of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. The people of that province said they wanted a voice from Avalon to Ottawa, not from Ottawa to Avalon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509048"> I encourage the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the government to reverse these things, to get down to Nova Scotia, meet with Danny Williams and Rodney MacDonald, discuss this issue and straighten this out for once and for all. Maintain those Atlantic accords and do not blackmail the people of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador. That is not how we do federalism in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509049">I can assure members that on the campaign trail my team and I work extremely hard, as do most of us. I can guarantee that this will give me an extra spring in my step to work that much harder. Any time I get an opportunity to debate whoever my Conservative counterpart will be in the election, I will welcome that individual to the debate. I will welcome that individual not just on this, but on veterans, seniors, the environment, health and education, all of these things that matter to the people of Nova Scotia and to people across this country. I welcome that debate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509050">In fact, I hope that person makes himself or herself public very soon because I would love to have a cup of coffee with that individual. I would love to knock on the doors opposite to that individual to see exactly how much standing up for the area that individual will do. The four previous Conservative candidates I ran against all said they wanted to be a strong voice for Sackville—Eastern Shore in Ottawa. We now find out that when Conservatives come to Ottawa, they become a strong voice for the Prime Minister's Office, not for the constituents they are elected to represent. That is a disgrace.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="509072">I am pleased to participate today in this discussion about Canada's equalization system, the way that the government has changed it and the deep concern in both Atlantic Canada and western Canada that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has failed to keep his word. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509073">At least five provinces are upset. The Conservative budget is proving to be controversial and deeply divisive in Saskatchewan, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509074">The details of equalization vary across the country. It is a complex system with 1,432 moving parts and all of those parts fluctuate and change over a four year time span during which fiscal results in 13 different jurisdictions are measured and compared.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509075">Reasonable people with different points of view can obviously have legitimate arguments about what formula is the best, but what cannot be argued, what is beyond all doubt, is that the Conservatives made a huge, specific equalization promise to buy votes in Saskatchewan in the 2005-06 campaign, and that promise, as of the budget, has been broken. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509076">Saskatchewan firmly believes that it has been lied to. So says the NDP government of Saskatchewan. So says the Saskatchewan Party, that would be the Conservative Party, the official opposition. So says every reporter, every columnist sand every journalist who has covered this story in Saskatchewan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509077">They differ on whether the promise was a smart one to make in the first place. Some of them argue that the promise was foolish or misguided to begin with. However, Saskatchewan is unanimous that the promise was in fact made and that it has in fact been broken. The issue in Saskatchewan has now changed. It is no longer a narrow debate about the fine points of equalization. It is now a more serious debate, a lament really, about not being able to trust the government, not being able to believe, in particular, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509078">The Conservative position, at least as it then was, was laid out in the House exactly two years ago today, on March 22, 2005. That day was designated as an opposition day, just like this day, and the Conservatives moved on that opposition day motion calling for the full exclusion of non-renewable natural resources from the equalization formula. The debate makes fascinating reading. I have it with me.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="509081">They all called for non-renewable natural resources to be removed, not just a little bit but 100%, from the equalization formula and those Conservatives were good enough to calculate exactly what that would mean in dollars for Saskatchewan. They did not leave it as an abstract matter of some formula. They put a dollar figure on it: $800 million per year, every year for Saskatchewan. That is what they told the people of Saskatchewan. It was in their speeches. It was in their election campaign material. It was everywhere. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509082">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> repeated the promise. He went on television about the promise. Election ads were run about the promise. It was clear, unequivocal and undeniable that the Conservatives would fully remove non-renewable natural resources from the equalization formula and Saskatchewan would thereby get an extra $800 million every year.</ParaText>

The Conservatives betrayed Saskatchewan because the cap they have imposed on Saskatchewan's fiscal capacity means non-renewable natural resources will never be fully excluded from the formula. Saskatchewan will never get that promised, I repeat the word “promised”, $800 million per year, $800 million from equalization alone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509085">What is in the budget, and I have read it with a great deal of care, is the rather paltry sum of $226 million for Saskatchewan for equalization and that amount is not ongoing. It is there once this year, probably an election year, and if we look to next year it is gone. The budget shows for next year in that column a great big zero. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509086">This is an absolute fraud on the people of Saskatchewan and especially so when we consider that last year's Conservative budget dug a deep financial hole for the province of Saskatchewan. Far from making the fiscal situation in Saskatchewan any better, the Conservative government last year made it worse: $105 million over four years was taken away from early learning and child care; $110 million over four years was taken away from labour market partnerships for workplace training; $130 million was taken away from financial aid for students seeking higher education; $80 million was taken away from the prairie grain roads program; $50 million was taken away from the innovation agenda. The loss in aboriginal programs and services was likely in the order of about $650 million over four years. That list goes on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509087">If we add that all together, the accumulated losses imposed on the Saskatchewan government and the Saskatchewan people by the Conservative government and its negative decisions in the past 14 months, the tally of the losses exceeds now $1 billion over four years, which is more than $250 million on average per year. That is the annual loss and it is an ongoing loss.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509088">Saskatchewan, in light of that, will not be placated by a one time capped payment of $226 million. Neither will Saskatchewan be fooled by this flim-flam, this con job, that somehow it is gaining by other means some $878 million. The most recent spin from Saskatchewan Conservative MPs is that this budget gives Saskatchewan $878 million. It is just not true. It is just more Conservative deception, false promises, concocted figures, everything, including the kitchen sink and the toilet, thrown together to tell a tale but not the truth. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509089">Their arithmetic includes a great deal of one-off, one time funding that is here today, gone tomorrow and is not ongoing on an annual basis. It includes some speculative projects that have not yet been approved by independent granting agencies that make the decisions, not the government according to the Auditor General. It even includes personal tax relief projections as if that is somehow an intergovernmental transfer of funding, and it is clearly not. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509090">The Conservatives fail to mention that virtually all that tax relief has already been offset, cancelled out already, by the personal income tax increases imposed by the government last year. They give with one hand what they have already taken away with the other. For all Canadians nationally, it is a new ongoing personal income tax burden of $1.4 billion in effect since last July.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="509109">Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to represent Humber—St. Barbe—Baie Verte and less pleased to have to speak on this issue in the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509110"> There are two debates going on right now about budget 2007. One is occurring on the floor of the House of Commons between members opposite. The other is occurring between provincial legislatures and the federal government. We now know that several provincial governments have gone offside with budget 2007 from the Conservative minority government. Those are the provinces of B.C., Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and as well New Brunswick. Others have expressed strong reservations about content in the budget. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509111">However, one debate is no longer raging and that is among Canadians, who have rejected the budget. They are very concerned. They understand exactly what is being expressed by those provincial premiers and are concerned for the well-being of their provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509112">It is very clear that each and every one of us in this debate is fully engaged in what is in the best interests of our provinces. This is not a new debate in some respects. Previous debates have been categorized as being with strong acrimony, strong language directed at members, sometimes there were personal taunts and insults. I am very pleased that this debate has not come down to that because this is about a very important issue. It is about maintaining the best interests of not only our individual provinces but our country as a whole.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509113">Strong concern has been expressed in my province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The issue at hand is about a promise being made and a promise kept. What is even more concerning is that when the promise was made, it was made emphatically, unconditionally and repeated over and again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509114">On January 23, 2006, a new minority government took office, one that held the smallest minority in the history of Canada, at only 125 seats. It reinforced again and again that it would maintain a commitment to remove 100% of non-renewable natural resources with no caps, no small fine print and no excuses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509115">For the last 14 months, that promise has been whittled away and not with a clear emphatic statement that the Conservatives would not honour the promise. We have heard messages, messages in budget 2006 issued by the <Affiliation DbId="78945" Type="18">finance minister</Affiliation>. In a document called, “Restoring the Fiscal Balance”, the Atlantic accord was described as a side deal, not supported by the current minority Conservative administration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509116">We then heard statements from the <Affiliation DbId="78945" Type="18">finance minister</Affiliation> and others that the Atlantic accords created an unfair advantage for Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509117">Today on the floor of the House of Commons, the <Affiliation DbId="78945" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance</Affiliation> for the first time, described it in very explicit detail. She said that the Atlantic accords established an unfair advantage to Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia and that the new budget would now create equality. Obviously this is an admission that the Conservatives are quashing the benefits of the Atlantic accords.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509118">This is is of great concern to me. For the last 14 months, premiers across the entire country have been operating under a set of principles or an understanding that the precision of law and the language of law is equal to the precision of the language of a promise. They have been establishing their own fiscal frameworks based on an understanding that the promise would be maintained and upheld. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509119">As they established their own budgetary processes, like the province of Newfoundland and Labrador is doing, such as consolidating and securing public sector pension plans, putting in place new transportation strategies, a new ferry rate system and establishing other progressive and positive measures for the people of Newfoundland and Labrador, it was based on an understanding that a commitment to remove 100% of non-renewable natural resources, no cap, no fine print, no excuses, would be maintained.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="509120">We have heard from the finance minister of Newfoundland and Labrador that the budgetary process will be maintained. The province is now developing its budget based on its understanding as it was, and that it will guide its actions accordingly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509121">However, it concerns me that we now have had statements in the House that the Conservatives were key players, instrumental in crafting the Atlantic accord. In fact, the <Affiliation DbId="78945" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance</Affiliation> said on the floor of the House of Commons this morning that as far as the Conservative Party of Canada was concerned, the Atlantic accords created an unfair advantage to the people of Newfoundland and Labrador and to Nova Scotia, that they would not have supported them and that budget 2007 was the correction to all of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509122">I do not think this was the commitment given by that party, which now forms this minority government, when it put out campaign literature and literature during the Atlantic accord saying, “There is no greater fraud than a promise not kept”. The Conservatives promised they would have a regime for equalization that would exempt non-renewable natural resources at a level of 100%, with no caps, no excuses and no small print.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509123">The government said that if it did not, then in effect the benefit from the natural resources would be removed 100% and it would maintain Newfoundland and Labrador as a have not province. Establishing the cap on equalization, as proposed, is effectively a cap, a clawback, and, therefore, by its own definition and words, is meant to maintain Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and other provinces as have not provinces. That is not fair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509124">What the government has proposed in budget 2007, which is one of the many reasons why I cannot accept this budget, is to establish a dual track equalization system once again. The Conservatives will agree to exempt 100% of non-renewables or 50% of renewable and non-renewable natural resources from the equalization formula on the provision that a cap be instituted so provinces receiving equalization must be maintained as have not provinces in perpetuity. That is from the Conservatives own party literature.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509125">Alternatively, the government suggests if those provinces that have received what it has deemed to be the unfair Atlantic accords, unfair in the national interest that create better benefits for Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia than other provinces, wish to maintain those Atlantic accords, they cannot accept the new equalization formula and, therefore, will also be left out of the 10 province standard. The government says the provinces cannot have it both ways. There cannot be a 10 province standard. The provinces cannot enjoy the enrichment of equalization to the tune of <?bk?>$1.5 billion<?ek?> and maintain the Atlantic accords.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509126">In other words, Newfoundland and Labrador will not receive any benefit whatsoever from the Conservatives fix to what they call the fiscal imbalance. What has been created by this is several provinces feel very strongly that there is now a strong interprovincial fiscal imbalance in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509127"> Why else would B.C., Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador express the concerns and the frustrations that they have expressed since budget 2007 was presented in the House on March 19? Why would those provinces come forward and say that they no longer know if they can afford or provide the essential public services that they felt were able to if the promise had been kept.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="509128">Mr. Speaker, once again, I am amazed at the rhetoric I am hearing from members opposite today. Consistently we have heard the members from Atlantic Canada try to demonstrate or prove that there is a fiscal cap on the Atlantic accord. There is no cap.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509129">Let me be clear for all members in this place and all Canadians watching this debate. The terms and provisions, the benefits that Atlantic Canada, Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia received from signing the Atlantic accord in 2004 have not changed. There is no fiscal cap placed on the Atlantic accord. There is no change to the provisions. There is no change to the wording. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509130">Therefore, the recipients, those being the provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia, received exactly the same deal that they received when they signed the deal. Yet although the budget absolutely refutes the fact, they are trying to say in the House that there is a cap on the accord. There is no cap.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509131">I am not sure if the member opposite is absolutely clueless about the wording of the budget and the impact he has on the accord, or if he is purposely trying to deceive people with his rhetoric.

              <ParaText id="509133">However, we come from a platform of strength in saying that when we made a promise, when we made a commitment, we fulfilled the promise. In fact to this day, the province of Newfoundland and Labrador has received the benefit of a cheque of $2 billion from a promise made, promise kept. However, it has not been kept by the Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509134">A fundamental, unfair choice was required, which restricted the national program from gaining access to the people, to the province and to the government of Newfoundland and Labrador. A decision point had to be taken. Either it had to take the new equalization formula, a 10 province standard that exempted 100% of non-renewable natural resources or 50% of all natural resources, with a cap, or keep its Atlantic accord and not enjoy the benefits of a 10 province standard, without fulfilling the Conservative promise of 100% of non-renewable natural resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509135"> The people of Newfoundland and Labrador know very well that non-renewable natural resources also include the riches of Voisey's Bay, the iron ore of Labrador City, Wabush, the gold of Baie Verte and onshore oil developments that are occur in the Port au Port Peninsula. That is the fundamental difference.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="509140">Mr. Speaker, there certainly was an element of Gerry in that. We on this side of the House worked very hard to get that Atlantic accord in place, and we were very successful with the $2.6 billion agreement being signed for Newfoundland and Labrador. In actual fact, the benefits of the Atlantic accord are probably much greater than that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509141">As we know, the Atlantic accord was established for Nova Scotia with the hard work of the MPs from Nova Scotia, and from Newfoundland and Labrador, based on an oil price of $35 a barrel. We now know the price of oil is much higher than that. Therefore, the $900 million that the member for <Affiliation DbId="78797" Type="2">Dartmouth—Cole Harbour</Affiliation> helped to achieve for his province, a $900 million cash payment upfront, was achieved with a $2 billion payment for Newfoundland and Labrador.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509142"> We know those benefits will be much higher under the circumstances with the price of oil. That is working very hard for one's province and constituency and seeing results, and that is the Liberal thing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="509144">I am honoured to be able to reiterate our commitment to the people of Atlantic Canada on how we delivered on our promise to exclude non-renewable resources and honour the offshore accords. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509145">All one has to do is read the budget as delivered by my esteemed colleague the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> on March 19 to see that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada has kept his promise to Atlantic Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509146">The <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> described budget 2007 as a historic document, and with good reason. Underpinning the budget exercise is our commitment to strengthening our federation and fulfilling the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister's</Affiliation> vision of open federalism in which all governments come together to help Canadians realize their full potential. Nowhere is that more evident than in our Atlantic regions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509147">We all appreciate the incredible beauty and richness of our Atlantic regions and we recognize their considerable contributions to making this country great. However, we also recognize the unique economic and fiscal challenges faced by these same provinces, particularly Newfoundland and Labrador, and the strong commitment of that province to improve its fiscal situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509148">It is evident that the development of offshore oil and gas projects over the course of the last decade has allowed Newfoundland and Labrador to benefit from one of the highest economic growth rates of any Canadian province in recent years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509149">However, the province also faces a range of economic and fiscal circumstances, notably, a high provincial debt burden and a declining population that will also give rise to unique challenges for the government of Newfoundland and Labrador in providing essential public services to its citizens. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509150">In recognition of these special economic and fiscal circumstances, we made a commitment to work to ensure that Newfoundland and Labrador receives even greater financial benefits from its offshore revenues. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509151">Similarly, our offshore agreement with Nova Scotia ensures that the people of Nova Scotia are primary beneficiaries of offshore resource revenues. This arrangement addresses the unique economic situation of Nova Scotia while also being fair to all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509152">The offshore accords with these two provinces provides them with a time limited payment to fully offset any reductions in equalization that would otherwise be triggered by their offshore revenues. With the protection of their offshore accords in the budget, Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia will continue to have the opportunity to make sustained improvements to their economic and fiscal situation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509153">It is important to note that we have honoured our commitment to Atlantic Canada by respecting the offshore accords as they were signed before the budget and after the budget. The Atlantic accord when signed was a historic day for Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia. When it happened in 2005, Premier Williams himself said:</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509155">It is important that Atlantic Canadians recognize that the Atlantic accords remain today as they were on that day, the day described by Premier Williams as a day of hope, a day of joy and a day of pride.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509156">There is more than that. In budget 2007, our new government, outside of respecting the Atlantic accords, has also invested more than $1.5 billion in Newfoundland and Labrador for priorities such as health care, the environment, infrastructure and education. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509157">This is also about building a strong, united Canada with a strong economic union. The budget makes some important inroads in restoring our fiscal balance by setting out a principled-base plan and taking immediate action through our commitments to restore fiscal balance with provinces and territories by putting transfers on a long term principled-based footing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509158">It also takes another step toward restoring fiscal balance with Canadian taxpayers through major tax reductions and our new tax back guarantee. It also makes governments more accountable to Canadians by clarifying roles and responsibilities. It will strengthen our economic union based on our plan set out in Advantage Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509159">Now that the fiscal balance has been restored, governments, including provincial governments, can focus on what matters to Canadians: strengthening our health care system; achieving excellence and accessibility in our post-secondary education system; ensuring that we have skilled workers to meet the needs of our economy and compete with the best in the world; help make training available to those who need it; and make progress on environmental challenges. We will create better roads and transit systems and again build a stronger economic union for Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="509160">Canada's new government committed to pursuing a vision based on open federalism. This vision is based on a renewed federation which respects areas of jurisdiction and limits the use of our federal spending power. Budget 2007 fulfills this commitment. It presents a long term plan which reflects the needs of all provinces and territories.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509161">It is also worth noting that fiscal balance and open federalism are not abstract concepts. In fact, for many Canadians, fiscal balance represents something very tangible. As my colleague the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> said, fiscal balance in essence is about better roads and renewed public transit, about better health care, better equipped universities, and cleaner oceans, rivers, lakes and air. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509162">It is about training to help Canadians get the skills that they need and it is about building a better future for our country. That means getting adequate funding to provincial and territorial governments. That is exactly what we did in our budget and that is exactly what the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has done in retaining the offshore accords in their entirety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509163">The <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> has good reason to refer to this budget as a historic document. I am particularly proud to note that our approach to open federalism and restoring fiscal balance is the result of significant consultations conducted with all of our partners, including the provinces. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509164">In the spirit of open federalism we worked with every province and territory, and sought views on ways to achieve a balance between a principle-based approach, to limiting federal spending power, and the need to ensure flexibility. We sought perspectives on lessons learned from the past, options for future consideration, and potential priority areas for action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509165">We also demonstrated to the provinces and territories our commitment to our new and open federalism. We provided an opportunity for provinces and territories to share their views on ways to achieve this level of accountability. We committed to returning the equalization program to a principle-based, formula driven footing as part of our plan to restore fiscal balance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509166">The equalization program was thoroughly studied by an independent expert panel chaired by Al O'Brien, a highly respected former Alberta deputy treasurer. The O'Brien report proposed a comprehensive, principles-based set of reforms to the equalization program. We reviewed this report and consulted extensively with Canadians and provincial governments. We have concluded that the O'Brien report forms a solid foundation for the renewal of the equalization program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509167">We now have a formula that is fair and principled to build a strong economic union in Canada. We kept our promise to the provinces and territories to exclude non-renewable resource revenues. Provinces have the option to receive payments based on full exclusion of resource revenues if it provides them a higher benefit. This is fair to all provinces and will help build a stronger and a united Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509168">We also kept our promise to Atlantic Canadians to fully respect the offshore accords. Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia will be able to continue to operate under the deal that they signed and we respect that. The new equalization program will also give provinces the higher of the payments calculated under 50% their natural resource revenues or full exclusion. This is also fair and principled. It is fair to all provinces and will also help build a strong, united Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509169">Giving provinces the benefit of exclusion, full exclusion, or 50% exclusion, fulfills our government's commitment to fully exclude non-renewable resource revenues without lowering payments to any province. And again, this is fair to all provinces. It is a principled approach and it is about building a strong economic union. We said that we would respect the offshore accords with Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia and we did. This is also fair and it was also the right thing to do. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509170">I would quote again the premier himself the day that the Atlantic accords were signed. He said: “A brand-new day has dawned in Newfoundland and Labrador—a day of hope, a day of joy, a day of pride and a day of promise”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509171">Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia continue to get the same benefits of their offshore accords and receive the full benefits envisioned in these agreements by the people of Atlantic Canada.</ParaText>

In the early part of the 20th century, Alberta's legislators campaigned to ensure that Alberta was granted full rights over its natural resources. Ottawa eventually acquiesced, but not without a fight. In the 1940s and 1950s, Alberta began to strike oil. The difference then was that natural resources were not clawed back in equalization, so while Alberta began to build an oil and gas industry, it used those profits to build [itself up].</QuotePara>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="509192">Mr. Speaker, let me thank my colleague for sharing her time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509193">Equalization is just part of the story. Under the new budget, this government has invested more than $1.5 billion in Newfoundland and Labrador for such priorities as health care, the environment, infrastructure and education. However, today's story is about equalization. I want to do two things. First of all, I want to put some factual information on the record. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509194">Newfoundland and Labrador is quickly becoming a have province, something we are very proud of. Just eight years ago, in 1999-2000, Newfoundland received $1.169 billion, almost <?bk?>$1.2 billion,<?ek?> in equalization payments. Since then there has been a steady and steep decline in equalization payments to the province: <?bk?>$861 million<?ek?> in 2005-06; $632 million this year; <?bk?>$477 million<?ek?> next year; and $197 million projected for 2008-09. That is an 85% drop in equalization payments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509195">The numbers tell a dramatic story of a long dependent province using its own resources to achieve self-reliance. It has not happened very often in this country, and it is usually the reverse, but it is happening right now in Canada's youngest province, my province, so far out on the eastern fringe of the country that most Canadians do not even notice us until we yell.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509196">Taking an 85% cut in equalization payments in 10 years cold turkey can be difficult. The Atlantic accord offset payments were negotiated to cushion that effect and to smooth the transition from an equalization receiving province to a non-receiving province, which we have always striven for, which is what we want to be. The accord offset payments do just that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509197">While equalization payments dropped, as I mentioned, to <?bk?>$861 million<?ek?> last year, Newfoundland received $189 million in offset payments under the accord for a total of $1.05 billion. This year equalization and the accord offset payments totalled <?bk?>$961 million.<?ek?> Some of that is because of our population drop. Next year they will total $971 million. In the following year when equalization payments drop down to $197 million, the accord offset payments will rise to $757 million for a combined payment of <?bk?>$954 million.<?ek?></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509198">The accord offset money is not taken from the pockets of other Canadians. It is revenue from the development of our own natural resources that Newfoundland can hold on to at least for a while to make adjustments to become a self-reliant province of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509199">Newfoundlanders and Labradorians are understandably concerned that those transitional accord benefits will be lost, reduced or kept in the new equalization plan that the <Affiliation DbId="78944" Type="18">finance minister</Affiliation> put forward in the budget. When Newfoundlanders are concerned, they let us know, as they are doing now. There are no back doors in my province. Everything is up front and very personal. We accept that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509200">However, Newfoundlanders need not worry about the accord offset payments. The payments remain intact just as they were negotiated by Premier Williams in 2005. They have not been changed. They have not been capped or mutilated in any way, not one tittle, not one jot, as former member John Crosbie would say.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509201">Let me come back to that. Accord offset payments will not go on forever. When the accord offset agreement was negotiated, the province and the federal government agreed to an expiry date which could come as soon as 2012 or as late as 2020, depending on whether or not Newfoundland and Labrador is still entitled to receive equalization in 2011 or 2012.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="509202">In any case, accord offset payments will run out either in 2012 or 2020. If Newfoundland and Labrador is still entitled to equalization when that happens or at any earlier time, the province may want to choose those payments to come through the new equalization program delivered in the budget. Under the new plan, all provinces will be able to exclude 50% of all their natural resource revenues or just non-renewable resource revenues from the calculation of fiscal capacity, whichever exclusion rate delivers the greatest benefits to each province.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509203">The new program gives much greater protection against declining resource prices and production levels and provides greater incentive for a resource rich province like mine to develop its resources. Simply put, the old formula penalized problems for developing resources. The new one rewards them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509204">Let me come back to something stated this morning by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78497" Type="2">Bonavista—Gander—Grand Falls—Windsor</Affiliation>. He talked about promises. Yes, there were promises and they have been quoted correctly. During the campaign our party committed to take out 100% of the non-renewable resources from the formula. That commitment was made as he stated, by the way. He said that in response to Premier Williams the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said that we would remove non-renewable resources from the formula. That is true. It is in writing not only to Premier Williams but to other premiers. That was a promise not to Newfoundland and Labrador but to the Canadian people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509205">There was one other promise and that occurred when the premiers themselves got together, when the finance ministers got together, when they met with federal officials and realized that the commitment would not be carried out simply because they could not agree. The premiers could not agree upon a common formula. They did not accept the 100% non-renewable resources out of the formula. The majority of them rejected it. They did not want it. A new formula had to be put in place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509206">Because equalization is a federal program, it was up to the federal government and the minister to find that compromise. The compromise was a report commissioned by the former government. It was a good report, supposedly a fair report that would put equalization on a fair and equitable base. However, it was evident that if that formula were accepted, as most premiers thought, at least one province that would lose, and maybe more, would be the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Premier Williams, in his wisdom, asked for a second commitment and there was a second promise made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509207">The member for <Affiliation DbId="78497" Type="2">Bonavista—Gander—Grand Falls—Windsor</Affiliation> said this morning that the Conservative Party would leave Newfoundland and Labrador with 100% of its oil and gas revenues and there would be no cap. He said it was a promise broken. That is totally incorrect. He either did not read the budget, does not understand it or does not understand our province. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509208">Premier Williams asked if the government went with the O'Brien formula whether it would make sure that the Atlantic accord was not capped. The commitment from this government to Newfoundland and Labrador is that the Atlantic accord will continue as it has and it will not be capped. Our province has not lost one cent, not one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509209">Could we have benefited if the premiers and the provinces had agreed to a new formula? Perhaps. It depends on who is in, who is out and what is brought or taken. However, we have not lost one cent and the commitment to deliver the Atlantic accord without a cap is there and will always be there until the agreement runs out. That is well into the future and Newfoundland and Labrador will be, not just well on its way, but it will be a have province.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509210">What would have happened if the leader of the Liberal Party had been in place? This is what he said.

We would have gotten nothing at all from the Liberals.</ParaText>

When we look at table one in the document “Restoring Fiscal Balance for a Stronger Federation” in the 2007 budget documents, it describes exactly what the impact will be to Newfoundland and Labrador and to Nova Scotia should they abandon their Atlantic accords, as is required of them if they want to participate in the new equalization formula. Should they do that, according to the government's own documents, it will cost the government of Newfoundland and Labrador $138 million in lost benefits, or for the province of Nova Scotia, it will cost the government of Nova Scotia $95 million, should they opt in to the new equalization formula.</ParaText>

However, when the commitment was made to the provinces by the federal government, a consensus could not be reached on the formula so one was brought in, the O'Brien formula, but we would lose. We knew that and Premier Williams knew that, which is why he asked for no cap on the Atlantic accord and got it. A third choice was given to two provinces only, Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia. The choice was that instead of taking either one of the other options, which would diminish their revenues, they could hold on to the Atlantic accord benefits for five or maybe thirteen more years.</ParaText>

When it comes to SISIP disabilities, these 4,000 members and their families are undergoing great financial suffering. For less than 2% of the budget surplus, the government could have fixed that problem once and for all, but now these people have to take the government to court.

              <ParaText id="509266">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to have a chance to speak to this motion and to try to live up to the performance of my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78918" Type="2">Cape Breton—Canso</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509267"> I want to congratulate my other colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78497" Type="2">Bonavista—Gander—Grand Falls—Windsor</Affiliation>, for bringing this forward. I particularly want to congratulate my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78801" Type="2">Halifax West</Affiliation>, who was the regional minister in Nova Scotia and who negotiated the Atlantic accord along with Premier Hamm and with the former prime minister of Canada and our former finance minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509268">If I may, I would like to preface my comments with a thought. As MPs, most of us come to this place with what I think are the best of intentions. We come here to represent our constituents. We also come here to act in a respectful and honourable manner, but every day at about 2:15 that kind of goes out the window, except on Fridays. Outside of question period, we get along. We travel together. We discuss issues. That is the way it should be. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509269">Every now and then things go beyond question period, and November 4, 2004, was one of those days, when the motion brought forward as an opposition day motion was prefaced by this statement: “That this House deplore the attitude of the Prime Minister of Canada at and following the First Ministers' Conference...”. It was a motion designed so that Liberals could not support it, even though at that very moment we were negotiating the Atlantic accord, which came into being about a month later and was enacted a month after that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509270">On those occasions, we had allegations. We had charges. As Liberal MPs, we were pilloried for no reason except politics. That is shameful, because at that time the prime minister, with the member for <Affiliation DbId="78924" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation>, then the minister of finance, and the member for <Affiliation DbId="78801" Type="2">Halifax West</Affiliation>, who was then the minister of fisheries and oceans, and Dr. John Hamm, the premier of Nova Scotia, a good and decent man who represented his province well, were negotiating the Atlantic accord. We had worked on it for a long time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509271"> Whenever I saw the member for <Affiliation DbId="78924" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation> anywhere in the parliamentary precinct, and I am not alone in this, he would tell me they were working on it and it was not easy. I know it was not easy. We knew that other provinces might say it was not fair. But when it came forward and the Atlantic accord was produced, not only was it adopted by the prime minister, the finance minister and the members from the Atlantic caucus, but I am proud to say that my Liberal colleagues from other provinces, where this accord was attacked, stood with us and voted for the Atlantic accord. It was difficult. It was not easy, but it got done. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509272">Today I stand here with my colleagues to talk about this motion that we have put forward. From my friends on this side we have heard about comments made on that day, November 4, that have backfired on Conservative MPs. We have heard the comments of Danny Williams. We have heard from Rodney MacDonald. We have heard from the premier of Saskatchewan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509273"> I am not going to give members a lot of quotes from other politicians. I want to give members some sense of what the media are saying in Nova Scotia, because they are very unbiased.

Apparently the media did find him yesterday, and I apologize for that error. I learned, after my speech this morning, that he had talked to the <I>Chronicle Herald</I> yesterday. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509325">It reports this morning that he spoke up in defence of an equalization plan. He said, “ the important thing is that Nova Scotia can choose to keep the accord or opt into the new equalization system”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509326">That is not what we agreed to when we signed the accord. The members on that side of the House obviously do not understand the accord. It is not about changing equalization; it is about changing the agreement related to offshore royalties. It is about saying that, as agreed originally, these two provinces get to have the primary benefit of their offshore resources. Members over there do not get it. It is like my hon. colleague says, they do not know the difference between the offshore accords and a Honda Accord.</ParaText>

I do not know if he has ever build a Honda Accord, but he was one of the architects of the Atlantic accord, along with the Liberal prime minister, our finance minister, Dr. Hamm, Jane Purves and those folks back home, who worked hard on this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509329">The Liberals brought in the offshore accords so they could be on top of equalization, not instead of equalization. When we enriched equalization, as we did in government, Nova Scotia got more money and kept the Atlantic accords. It was not one or the other. It was not a Faustian choice. It was a sensible choice for a region of the country that deserves better.</ParaText>

Opposition House leaders have been asking about this bill for some time now. We have been asking for a report from the <Affiliation DbId="78744" Type="4">Minister of Labour</Affiliation> as to exactly what is wrong with Bill C-47 and how the Minister of Labour proposes to correct it. The minister made some favourable comments in question period a few moments ago, so I wonder if the House leader could indicate if we will see that bill in the properly revised form within the course of the next 10 days.</ParaText>

I understand that is subject to a technical amendment in the other place today. I wonder if the government House leader would give us the assurance that the unelected Conservative senators in the other place will not delay that bill. Perhaps we could deal with it tomorrow or at the beginning of next week.</ParaText>

However, we hope that Bill <Document DbId="2221899" Type="3">C-16</Document> will progress and will be approved in a form that is appropriate and reasonable to approve and that we will have it here to deal with in the House quickly.

              <ParaText id="509608">Tomorrow we will continue debate on second reading of Bill <Document DbId="2519653" Type="3">C-35</Document>, which is the bail reform bill.

That is the kind of dispute I believe we have here.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="509681">Many in Saskatchewan and Canada know that I won my riding by a small margin in a tough fought campaign. I have the greatest of respect for all the candidates that took part in that campaign. I openly and without reservation encouraged a call for two separate recounts, the first by Elections Canada and the second by a Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509682">Several allegations were made on my win, which ranged from attacks on my character to the voting process in the aboriginal communities, specifically first nations communities. These allegations were all refuted by a thorough investigation by Elections Canada, which I also submit clearly absolved me of any of these alleged wrongdoings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509683">Despite this my reputation and character is still being attacked. During the proceedings last night, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78724" Type="2">Palliser</Affiliation> began to insult me and my standing in the House. He referred to me as a “vote fraud artist”. This comment was picked up by the microphone of the <Affiliation DbId="78968" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Indian Affairs</Affiliation> and is very clear on the taped proceedings of last night.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509684">As far as I know, when an allegation to that extent is made, it is an offence. The member was accusing me of committing an offence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509685">I am sure outside the House those types of allegations would carry a different recourse than when they are said in the House. Some people just have to say what they have to say with the protection of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509686">After making this disgusting personal insult, the member then attacked the aboriginal communities that the former MP had made allegations against and which were also refuted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509687">First nations people were denied the right to vote in this country during more than half of the country's existence. When they come out to vote and are told that they are frauds and there are unscrupulous accusation that they are not entitled to vote, that is a shame to this parliamentary system. We have people in this country who were denied the right to vote and did not get it until the 1960s. Then, when they start to participate, they are attacked because the government opposite does not like the turnout now.</ParaText>

Shortly thereafter, in order to allow members to proceed to the House, two motions to adjourn the meeting of the committee were proposed and defeated, the majority on the committee choosing to continue debate on the motion then under consideration.</ParaText>

I refer the hon. member to Standing Order 108(1)(a) and Standing Order 113(5).

              <Affiliation DbId="79021" Type="2">Mr. Thierry St-Cyr (Jeanne-Le Ber, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="509715">Mr. Speaker, the Liberal motion before us today is a perfect example of how poorly Canadian federalism is working. By making piecemeal agreements, by creating a patchwork of claims and promises all over the place, we completely lose sight of the essential element of this issue. What is before us now, among other things, is the equalization issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509716">Let us review the fundamentals of the equalization principle. What is it all about? Equalization is a system that redistributes tax revenues from all citizens—Quebeckers, Maritimers, Westerners, Ontarians and everyone else. The government puts all those tax dollars together and then redistributes them to some provinces to give them similar fiscal capacity. That is the goal. The goal is that no matter which province a person lives in, the provincial governments can provide services similar to those offered in the other provinces. Each province makes its own choices, but they should all be able to count on having similar fiscal capacity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509717">Normally, the process should be pretty simple. Average fiscal capacity is calculated according to how much each province can collect in sales and income taxes and fees of all kinds. Then, provinces that fall below the average fiscal capacity are given enough money to reach that capacity, without penalizing the provinces that are above the fiscal capacity average. This system seems very simple and should work very well, but it is not working properly. Why? Because the government has lost sight of the essential elements of the system and has signed on to a bunch of piecemeal agreements for preferential treatment for various regions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509718">The Liberal motion and their position on these piecemeal agreements that were already in place are a concrete example of how the government will try to sign individual, piecemeal agreements to show favouritism to various provinces over and above the principle of fairness provided for in the equalization program. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509719">So much for the Liberals. However, we note that the Conservative's proposal in the budget also goes down the same road in that, regardless of the principle of equity, regardless of the principle of wanting all provinces to have a similar fiscal capacity, arbitrary rules will be established that will change the formula and benefit or disadvantage certain provinces. The rule found in the current budget excludes half of tax revenues from non-renewable natural resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509720">That may seem technical, but really it is not. It is very, very concrete. The end result is that provinces that produce a great deal of non-renewable natural resources appear to be less rich than they are in reality. When their capacity is calculated, their ability to raise tax revenues is understated and their overall fiscal capacity is then changed accordingly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509721">For Quebec, among others, this represents billions of dollars in losses year after year. That would not be the case if all revenue from non-renewable natural resources were included. It should be noted that we were not asking for preferential treatment for Quebec.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="35">(1535)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="509722">We were only asking that the basic principle of fairness be applied so that all provinces have the benefit of the same fiscal capacity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509723">Why exclude non-renewable natural resources? Since the debate began no one in this House has been able to answer this question. The reason is simple: there is no rational reason; the only reason is quite arbitrary. It was decided, just like that, to exclude this area of tax revenue because it was in the best interests of certain provinces. Furthermore, it allowed some politicians to defend their provinces. And very well, indeed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509724">So why, for example, were renewable resources such as hydroelectricity not excluded? The Government of Quebec earns significant revenues from its hydroelectricity. Excluding this resource from the equalization formula would have generated much more money for Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509725">Why not exclude revenues from the aerospace industry? As if! Why did the members from the Bloc Québécois not stand up and ask for that? Honestly, why did my fine colleagues not think of that? They should have thought of that. Let us exclude the aerospace sector from the equalization calculation. It just so happens that this sector is in Quebec. Well, that would be great! Why did none of the Bloc Québécois MPs ask for that? Because it is completely arbitrary. Why exclude sectors of the economy from the equalization calculation? There is no reason other than to unduly disadvantage one province. For that reason, I believe that the Liberal motion is off base.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509726">Even though the government's proposal in the budget gives Quebec some supplementary money, it does not go far enough to fully respect the principle of equalization, which is to ensure the same fiscal capacity for everyone by taking into account all the revenues the provinces might benefit from.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509727">There is another adverse effect to excluding non-renewable resources from the equalization calculation. When it comes to the Kyoto protocol and reducing greenhouse gases, there will be incentives for provincial governments to develop these industries at the expense of other industries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509728">We already knew there were incentives for companies, for the oil companies and so forth, but now there will be incentives for governments. A provincial government is better off developing non-renewable energies since the revenues the province earns from those resources will not be included in the equalization calculation. That government will therefore earn twice as much money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509729">This is not productive at all. It is unfair and should be changed quickly, in the next budget, I hope. In any case, the Bloc Québécois will continue to fight for all natural resource revenues to be included, whether the resource is renewable or not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509730">Some will say that this represents a lot of money for Quebec. Nonetheless, out of all the provinces that receive equalization, Quebec receives the least per capita. In this group of provinces that receive money under equalization, Quebec is by far the most populous. Therefore, the total amount of money should be greater.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509731">Nonetheless, we must not be fooled by this figure. It is normal that, in all the transfers, the more populated provinces receive more in total than less populated provinces. That is the very principle of equalization. The principle aims to ensure that all provinces can provide the same services to their citizens. It is therefore only normal that more populated provinces need more money to provide the same services.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="40">(1540)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="509732">The question of equalization is only one aspect of the larger problem that is the fiscal imbalance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509733">The Bloc will support this budget because we see the beginnings of a move to correct the fiscal imbalance. The money is on the table and, since a good portion of that money belongs to Quebeckers, of course we will take it. However, the government must go even further.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509734">Let us get back to the basics. The expression “fiscal imbalance” exists for a reason. In Quebec, the Séguin commission is the basis for a consensus that transcends all political parties. Everyone subscribes to it. When Mr. Séguin and the members of his commission decided to name this problem the “fiscal imbalance”, they did not pull these words out of a hat at random. They did not believe that, by putting together the words “fiscal” and “imbalance”, they would baptize the problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509735">There is an underlying reason for the expression “fiscal imbalance”. It is simple. They called it that because, first of all, it is an imbalance, and secondly, because it is a fiscal problem. they did not call it the “budget imbalance”, the “monetary imbalance” or the “financial imbalance”. They called it the “fiscal imbalance”. Thus, we are talking about a fiscal issue, a taxation issue, here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509736"> The imbalance arises from the fact that the federal government takes too much in income tax to provide the services it is constitutionally bound to offer. And on the other hand, the provinces do not have enough tax revenue to be able to offer all the services they are bound to provide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509737"> The problem continues to grow because the provinces’ independent tax revenue remains stable while federal government revenue increases significantly. At the same time, the provinces’ expenditures are steadily increasing because education and health account for a large part of provincial budgets. They cost a lot. The increase exceeds inflation, while the expenditures of the federal government are much easier to control and increase much more moderately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509738"> What conclusion can we draw from this? Only a tax solution will make it possible to settle the fiscal problem once and for all. It means transferring some tax fields from the central government to the provinces. To my mind this is obvious.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509739"> This week the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> said that the fiscal imbalance was over. My goodness, he has not understood what the fiscal imbalance is. He demonstrates perfectly that the presence of the Bloc Québécois in this Parliament is more necessary than ever. He claims to be solving a problem but he is showing clearly that he has not understood.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509740"> If he had not understood the word “<I>déséquilibre</I>”, I would have said to myself that, since in English the term is imbalance, perhaps the translation was not right. However, the word “fiscal” is written the same way in English and in French.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509741"> So there are no reasons to explain why the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister </Affiliation>do not understand the meaning of the word “fiscal”. There is no reason for them not to understand that they cannot claim to have settled the problem once and for all as long as they have made any fiscal transfers?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509742"> And what would those be? What the Séguin commission most enthusiastically recommended was a transfer of the GST, probably because that would be the simplest thing. For example, the federal government could stop collecting the 6% tax in Quebec, and in return, the Quebec government would collect 6% more for itself. For the taxpayer this would have no impact, but it would have an impact on Canadian federalism. This would enable Quebec to have independent revenue, revenue it can control, that it can plan on and that is not subject to the vagaries of the federal government’s decisions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509743"> Such is today’s reality: Quebeckers, even with this beginning of a settlement, remain dependent upon the federal government.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="45">(1545)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="509744"> It is dependent because, on March 27, after the election, the government can change its budget if it wants to. It can change the equalization formula. The fact is that for the past five years, the equalization formula has changed nearly every year. It is time to escape from this dependence, and in the short term, under the current federal structure, that can only be achieved by a fiscal transfer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509745"> I spoke of the example of the GST, which could be used. There could also be a transfer of income tax points. That has already been done in the past. The federal government could agree to a reduction in income tax for residents of Quebec, and, in return, the Government of Quebec could raise more income tax from its taxpayers. This was done during the time of Pierre Elliott Trudeau and René Lévesque. When the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister </Affiliation>told us yesterday that he would not negotiate with a sovereignist government, he revealed the extent to which he does not understand reality and also how contemptuous he is of Quebec democracy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509746"> In my opinion, there is a message that must be drawn from the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s remarks this week. It is that this government believes it can get away with anything. He scorns Quebeckers when he says, “We have settled the fiscal imbalance. We have decided that the fiscal imbalance is resolved and those who are not happy can go back home”. Then he says, “From now on, we will negotiate only with those we choose. If the government that you elect—that Quebeckers elect—does not suit us, we will not negotiate with it”. That is intolerable and unacceptable because it denies Quebeckers the right to choose their own government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509747"> I am convinced that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s remarks will arouse Quebeckers, because they know that having the Parti Québécois in power in Quebec will best defend their interests. That is certainly obvious and we saw it clearly in the reaction of the party leaders after the unfortunate remarks by the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. Only André Boisclair stood up and said that no one can tell us whom to choose as our government. The choice will be made by Quebeckers and the federal government will have to accept that choice. That is all that we ask of it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509748"> This is not the first time that the government has interfered in the decisions made by Quebeckers. It did so in the last two referendums, and in 1995 it did so in a particularly shameful way, spending millions of dollars during the referendum campaign to promote its option in violation of Quebec’s referendum law. So the federal government has obviously learned nothing. It is still the same dominating, centralizing, paternalistic government that tells Quebeckers what to think and do. It still does not understand the Quebeckers want to take charge of their own affairs. That is where I am headed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509749"> What we see here is an inability to resolve the fiscal imbalance and develop an equalization plan in keeping with the basic principles of a normal federation. That shows us one thing: the only way forward for Quebeckers is to take charge of our own affairs and have a country of our own, not because we do not like Canadians—I like most of my colleagues here with whom I have had a chance to go out, have a beer, and so forth—but simply because we are obviously bad for each other. We are bad for each other because in wanting as many powers as possible for our National Assembly, in wanting to make all our own budgetary choices, and in wanting to pass all our own laws, we Quebeckers prevent Canada from becoming what it really wants to be, that is to say a country with a strong central government that gets involved in education, health care and a multitude of other areas outside its own jurisdiction. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509750"> The choice that Quebeckers are going to make next Monday is to say that we are going to make the right decision, we are going to choose to pass all our own laws, to control all our budgets, to sign all our international treaties and to make our voice heard in the rest of the world. This choice means giving ourselves a country and achieving sovereignty, and that starts by supporting the Parti Québécois next Monday. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="509758">Mr. Speaker, I will begin with a simple answer. We will vote against the Liberals' motion because we do not support piecemeal agreements that violate the principle of equalization. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509759">To get back to the issue of Conservative members from Quebec who are supposedly working in our best interest, one might ask why there are two levels for natural resources: 0% and 50%. Moreover, why is it that the level that would be best for Quebec, that is, 100% inclusion, is not in the budget? Why is it that in this budget, a province that would benefit from the 0% level can choose, and a province that would benefit from the 50% level can choose, but a province like Quebec, which would benefit from a 100% inclusion, cannot choose? Because it is not in the budget. Is that, perhaps, because the Conservative members from Quebec did not do their jobs? Perhaps they did not do their jobs, but there might be another possibility. Maybe they are not able to do their jobs. Maybe the Quebec members do not participate in making this government's decisions. Why? That is the problem with this federation. This federation was not created for minorities like Quebeckers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509760">The only solution open to Quebeckers is to take charge and get out of this dependency situation calmly, peacefully and with good will. They must understand that Canadians want to build a country in their own image that meets their own needs. Fine. Who can blame them? We, however, as Quebeckers, should do as Canadians, Germans, the French, Americans, Venezuelans, the Congolese and who knows how many others around the world have done: make our own decisions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="509762">Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that the member is not supporting the motion put forward by the member from Newfoundland and Labrador.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509763">I would still like to offer a warning. The member and his party intend to support this budget because, in their opinion, it partly addresses the thorny issue of fiscal imbalance. I do not see anything in this budget that bears this out, that ensures that money collected this year will be collected in years to come. There is only a promise from the current government, the Conservative government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509764">In 2004, the same government said it fully supported the Atlantic accord. Now, it is asking the premiers of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador to play Russian roulette, and to think about accepting a few more equalization dollars, since all the promises made under the Atlantic accord are not being kept. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509765">I can easily imagine that next year, or any other year in which the Government of Quebec is not holding an election and is not in an election period, the Conservative <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> would be less generous to the Government of Quebec than he was a few days before a provincial election.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="509766">Mr. Speaker, I agree with much of what I just heard. I am even tempted to order the audio tape and make sure that all of Quebec hears it. It is the best argument in favour of sovereignty and the best argument confirming that the fiscal imbalance issue has not been resolved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509767">Yes, the Liberal member is entirely correct. There is absolutely no guarantee that this money will be available next year. Just as his government reneged on some promises, so has the new government. There is nothing to guarantee Quebeckers that this money will still be available for the next budget. I completely agree with the hon. member.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509768">In fact, that was the point of my entire speech. During the 20 minutes of my speech, I explained that, as long as there is no fiscal solution, there is no permanent solution. The only avenue left for Quebeckers is to take charge of their own future and become sovereign.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="509769">Mr. Speaker, I would first like to congratulate my colleague on his speech on the fiscal imbalance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509770">At this time, the budget presented by the Conservative Party aims to begin resolving the issue of fiscal imbalance. Solutions are proposed to offset the fiscal imbalance, such as writing a cheque every year. What the Bloc Québécois has been calling for for years, rather, is a tax transfer. As my colleague explained very clearly, this would consist of tax point transfers or GST transfers to the Quebec government. This would place all fiscal responsibility on the Quebec government for planning its future revenue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509771">Now here is my question. Can my hon. colleague comment briefly or draw a parallel to explain to us the advantages of the formula proposed by the Bloc Québécois, that is, obtaining tax points or GST transfers instead of being given a cheque every year, based on the whim or impulse of the government of the day?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="509772">Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question. The advantage would be the resulting budgetary independence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509773">I believe that the purpose of our political existence is to achieve political independence for Quebeckers as quickly as possible. This week's budget is a case in point: it has allowed Quebec sovereignists to score several points and to demonstrate what we wanted to contribute.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509774">First, there is our incredible dependence on the federal state. When the tabling of a federal budget becomes an issue in a provincial election, there is a problem with the federation. Primarily it is a sign of the dependence of this province on the choices made by the central government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509775">The budget benefits sovereignists in another way. With funds provided to the next government formed by André Boisclair's Parti Québécois, we can show Quebeckers what they will be able to do when they control their own taxes and they make their own budget decisions. The effect is similar to that of the Club Med advertising: 15 seconds of Club Med, could you imagine a week? With one, two or three billion dollars in taxes recovered, we can then suggest to Quebeckers that they imagine what it will be like when we recover $41 billion in taxes.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="509831">Mr. Speaker, let us be clear that what is on the table is a new plan for Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, if they care to take it, and the rest of Canada. But what is also on the table for Nova Scotia is the Nova Scotia-Canada offshore accord exactly as it was negotiated under the former government in 1982 by the provincial government in Nova Scotia and in 1986 by the Buchanan government in Nova Scotia. It is exactly the same plan. If that is the best plan for Nova Scotia, the plan that the Liberals signed, then it should take that plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509832"> I am here to say it is not the best plan because the new plan offers $95 million more in equalization payments to Nova Scotia. It offers $112 million in tax relief to Nova Scotians. The Liberals can obfuscate and disenfranchise as much as they want, but the reality is the new plan is better. If the Nova Scotia government decides it wants to take the old plan for some long term planning reasons, it has that option.</ParaText>

It is a great motion that illustrates very well the concerns that we have in Atlantic Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509844">Canadian seniors particularly saw $25 billion to $30 billion being ripped off from their savings by a broken promise on income trusts. Atlantic Canadians are seeing hundreds of millions, if not billions, more being stolen from their provincial treasuries by breaking this promise on the Atlantic accord.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509845">It is a calculated manoeuvre that comes out of a sense of entitlement by the leader of the Conservative Party, an entitlement to be <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in a government that would have a majority so that he could bring forward an agenda that would be much more right wing than anything we have seen in decades in this country. That is what he is attempting here. If he wanted to build a nation rather than a majority, he would be looking at assisting the weakest so that they could meet their potential and bring the country up in all regions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509846">He could have looked at lowering taxes for those with a lower income, lowering the taxes that he increased in the last budget. He could have increased the child tax benefit, helping all Canadians of low and modest income. He could have assisted single seniors, who are among the hardest hit in our country, from the rising cost of fuel and other problems that make the basic cost of living go up quite a lot. He could have assisted on child poverty. There are still a million children living in poverty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509847">Next year he intends in his budget, according to past promises, to reduce the GST again by another per cent, which would be roughly $6 billion. That would bring a million children out of poverty, but there is none of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509848">He could have assisted students, but when he sees the plight of the students, it is a little like Marie Antoinette before the French revolution who said, “Let them eat cake”. Now the minister says “Let them buy steaks”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509849">Some investments and calculations are based on “who we can get to vote for us”. There is a ring around Toronto where people are quite affluent and another ring of people around Montreal, so he goes after those people. As for the rest of the country, it does not matter too much. Alberta will do fine. It gets some money. Provinces such as Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador and British Columbia get zero, not one penny more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509850">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has often said that Atlantic Canada has a culture of defeatism. He wants to make sure that by doing this, we are completely defeated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509851">The Atlantic accord was a hard fought victory for Atlantic Canada. A lot of people carried a lot of weight. Dr. Hamm is to be commended on the work he did. The then minister, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78801" Type="2">Halifax West</Affiliation>, the members from Newfoundland, all the Atlantic caucus worked with the government. We could not always get what we wanted. It took a long time. It was a battle of many years, but finally we did get it. Premier Williams of Newfoundland joined that battle. He did a lot of work on it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509852">The situation at that time was that the offshore revenues would go to the federal government. The federal government would return 100% of those revenues to the provincial governments, but a large part of that would be calculated against equalization. The ability of the provinces to use these resources, which are finite in nature and very expensive to extract, was quite limited in improving their overall economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509853">Those provinces made the argument successfully that they should get all of those revenues and that they should be able to invest that in their provinces and that it should not be calculated against future considerations, changes in equalization programs or anything else. It should be above and beyond what they would normally get.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509854">In the last budget by the Liberal government there was an increase in equalization and it did not reduce the money for the accord. There was no question of making choices. The money was above and beyond. The provinces had the right to expect that it would be like that in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509855">What do we see this year? We have a province like Nova Scotia with a lot of requirements for highway infrastructure, for investments in education, health care, social services, productivity, research and development, the modern economy.

              <ParaText id="509856">They knew that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> would be putting a lot of money in the equalization formula to appease those votes he is trying to get in the more populous provinces so they could expect to get that money by election day. “No, Russian roulette is what you are going to have to play, Williams; Russian roulette, MacDonald.

He was the only cabinet minister in the John Hamm government to get on the leadership team of the Prime Minister when he was seeking the leadership. He has been very loyal to him. He was one of the three co-chairs in Nova Scotia of his campaign. He was very mad about the way they were being played, like a fiddle I think is the way that it was mentioned in a Nova Scotia newspaper.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509863">Jane Purves, chief of staff to the premier of Nova Scotia during the time of John Hamm, a cabinet minister herself, minister of education, knows how difficult it is to make ends meet in the Nova Scotia budget. She was planning to run in Halifax for the Conservatives and today she is not so sure. I was reading those things. I do not know that she wants to go around defending the budget. What she and the premier, and Liberal MPs and MLAs had for many years argued and fought for and finally got, with one stroke of a pen the premier and the minister of finance of Nova Scotia were put in a position where they have to play Russian roulette, a few dollars more this year and maybe billions of dollars less.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509864"> If there is no oil and gas industry, it is an easy decision. If there is no expansion, if the second field or future fields do not go on stream, take the money, get the new equalization money. But if it happens in the future, it could be the wrong decision, like premier Buchanan made in his agreements with a Conservative government previously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509865"> I think the minister of finance was Greg Kerr. He ran against me last time and will run again. He will be much more happy because this is his type of management.

              <ParaText id="509870">We can see that there is a significant difference. We have to keep in mind that equalization is an issue that was identified in our Constitution.

              <ParaText id="509879">Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate my colleague from West Nova for his very articulate and impassioned debate and speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509880">One of the things that I would like the member to expand on is the fact that the motion calls upon the government not to abandon the principles of equalization. One of those main principles, of course, is that provinces that have necessary resources are able to balance those resources with the provinces that do not have the necessary resources so that services and programs are roughly equivalent across this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509881">If we look at Atlantic Canada, we can see that there are many challenges there. If we look at the province of Quebec, of course, it is a have not province now because of the policies of the separatists, but I am wondering about this. I know that technically the province of Quebec can take the $693 million that it got out of the increase in equalization and can do whatever it wants with that money. Does it not seem a bit strange, though, that Quebec would take that money to reduce taxes after the provinces have complained bitterly to the federal government that they need the resources to provide health care and education to their citizens?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="509882">Mr. Speaker, I will speak about the way the money was being used in Nova Scotia. The premier of Nova Scotia took the advance payments that came under the Canada-Nova Scotia offshore agreement and put them against the debt, the debt created by Premier Buchanan and Greg Kerr and the group, and reduced the fiscal payouts on interest by $40 million a year. That was a very responsible thing to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509883">Fiscally, Nova Scotians are having a hard time this year. The difficulty would be $40 million or $50 million worse had that decision not been taken. Nova Scotians also would have liked to have a tax break, but I think the more responsible thing was done by Premier Hamm. I congratulate him on doing that and I implore the federal government, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to restore the full Atlantic accord so that such decisions can be continued in the future.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="509884">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to take part in this debate and speak to the motion by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78497" Type="2">Bonavista—Gander—Grand Falls—Windsor</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509885"> I am eager to tell Canadians, constituents back in Central Nova and all Nova Scotians just what this new budget is going to do for them and just what the consequences are of this way the government has taken to restore the fiscal balance that is required in a nation as grand and as diverse as our own.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509886">While the members of the previous government, the Liberal Party opposite, stand in this House and preach from on high about what they would like to do, let us not forget that they were there for 13 years. There was nothing stopping them from addressing this issue of the fiscal balance. Instead, what they actually did, and the record is very clear on this, was gut $25 billion out of the equalization program. They took away money that provinces were using for health care, for infrastructure and for important projects and important investments throughout Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509887">What this government is doing is exercising fiscal fairness. We are exercising the type of federalist flexibility required to bring a country together and to recognize that there are disparities in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509888">I want to point out two very specific things in my remarks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509889">Number one is that the province of Nova Scotia is getting an increase this year, an increase, even under the old formula, of almost $200 million. In fact, it is getting $2.44 billion from the federal government this year. That number is staggering when we start to think about how that is invested in various things throughout the entire province of Nova Scotia. That figure, in fact, would include a $95 million increase if they were to opt into this new modified O'Brien program for the province, so let us keep that in mind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509890">With respect to the allegation that somehow we are taking something away from the province of Nova Scotia, nothing could be further from the truth. The Atlantic accord remains fully intact, 100% respected by this government if the province of Nova Scotia opts to stay in that program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509891">When that program was put forward, members of this party, my colleague from South Shore—St. Margaret's and my colleague from Cumberland—Colchester, fought long and hard to see that the Atlantic accord was achieved. People have already spoken about the merits of the Atlantic accord, in terms of John Hamm, the premier at that time, working long and hard to bring the government of the day, the Liberal Party opposite, kicking and screaming to the point where finally it had to sign on to the Atlantic accord.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509892">When that happened, we all celebrated. That was a good day for Nova Scotia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509893"> That was a great deal for Nova Scotia, so what we are saying today is that Nova Scotia can keep that great deal or it can take an even better deal, one that gives Nova Scotia an additional <?bk?>$95 million.<?ek?> So it is door number one, good deal, or door number two, better deal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509894">We have heard about the requirement of Nova Scotia, about the budget they are about to draft tomorrow and the requirement for more money. That option is there for them. The option is clearly there. And I will go one better. If that is to happen and Nova Scotia decides that it is going to opt for this new proposal, which will give them more money, they have the flexibility to go back. They have the flexibility to use the Atlantic accord. It is a choice they have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509895">Speaking of choices, the members opposite, in the withering windsock that is the Liberal Party, speak of principles. What we know is that they do have principles, but if people do not like those principles or if polls change, they have other principles. That is the way they have operated for so many years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509896">We are all aware of the current Liberal leader's position. He denies the existence of a fiscal imbalance. In fact, in January of this year, the newly minted Liberal leader pronounced,“I don't think there is a fiscal imbalance”. He said that each province, every time, each and every way, is arguing that it gets shortchanged by Ottawa and that it would be difficult to make all the provinces smile. Yet that is exactly what the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> tried to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509897"> That is exactly what he tried to do. This motion is the calculation of another flip-flop on behalf of a weak Liberal leader who has not been upfront with Atlantic Canadians about his own position. The usual criticisms that come from the opposite side never come with a solution. They never come with “this is how we would do it differently”. They just castigate, criticize and tear down without describing what they would do as an alternative.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="509898">The truth of the matter is that Premier Williams in fact got exactly what he asked for. We honoured the Atlantic accord and we did it while restoring fiscal balance to the federation, and we did it by keeping our promise to exclude 100% of natural resources. He is caught between a rock and a better place. That is where the Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador finds himself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509899">Back in May of 2006, the Leader of the Opposition was very much in favour of a principled approach to reforming the equalization program and supported Premier McGuinty's call for fairness campaign, but now, once again, he has flipped. He said, “I think you need to have a clause that says whatever is the formula of equalization payments, a province that received equalization payments cannot see its fiscal capacity going above the fiscal capacity of a province that does not receive equalization payments”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509900"> He is now saying exactly what we are saying: that there has to be fairness. There has to be a recognition that an equalization formula is for everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509901">The member for <Affiliation DbId="78821" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation> knows a lot about flip-flops. He flipped to one side of the House. He flopped back to the other side of the House. He has changed his position on everything from ACOA to tax cuts. Name the position and he has tried it. He has turned himself inside out. He is an Olympic back-flipper. Here is what he had to say: “I find that Atlantic Canadian politicians”, so he is speaking about himself, “by and large, are too parochial”. This was part of his pithy and partisan commentary. </ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509904">That is what he had to say back then. He is firmly on record on so many other subjects about ACOA. He was an MP, he boasted in 2003, “who had the guts to say ACOA isn't working for Atlantic Canada, and (to urge) getting rid of it and replacing it with dramatic tax reform for Atlantic Canada...”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509905"> He went on to say, “I believe we need to replace failed regional economic development programs and corporate welfare with dramatic corporate-tax reductions, because the market can pick winners and losers better than bureaucrats”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509906">That was then and this is now. Each and every day we see that hypocrisy knows no bounds. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509907">This particular attempt, plain and simple, is about fairness: it is about giving Nova Scotians an option. It is about giving Premier MacDonald the opportunity to bring forward a budget that speaks to the needs of Nova Scotia just the way our budget does the same.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509908">I want to turn our attention back to the offshore accord itself. Nova Scotia, I repeat, may continue to operate under the previous equalization system until its existing offshore agreement expires. This fulfills and builds upon the government's commitment to respect the offshore accords. It also ensures that the province will continue to receive the full benefit it is entitled to under the previous system, if it so chooses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509909">But the beauty of this is that there is another option. There is an option to opt in to the new formula, a new formula that has been calculated in fairness with all of the provinces and that gives Nova Scotia more. It gives the province of Nova Scotia an additional <?bk?>$95 million,<?ek?> so it is take the deal that is good for Nova Scotia now, take a deal that will provide Nova Scotia with more money, and the option to move if at the end of the year there is a decision that Nova Scotia feels that might be advantageous to it. That is what is being offered. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509910">We are willing to work with the province of Nova Scotia the way we always have and the way we will continue to, to see that the province of Nova Scotia is treated fairly and with the same level of respect it has always been afforded by this government. That is why we have the Canada health transfer, which this year will provide our province, the province of Nova Scotia, with $21.3 billion, our portion being $636 million for the province of Nova Scotia. The same can be said of the Canada social transfer of $270 million for the province.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509911">With respect to our infrastructure, there is an enormous opportunity called the Atlantic gateway. Our portion of that particular set-aside, that $2.2 billion fund that would see Nova Scotia tap into the container traffic that is coming from Asia, coming from the Orient, will give our province a chance to make a major breakthrough. I would suggest that this in fact is bigger than the potential of the offshore if we can capture that traffic and that type of business and economic growth; that again is an opportunity and this government wants to work with the province.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509912"> The money is there. The negotiations that will lead to greater money under health care, under infrastructure and under other programs are available to Nova Scotia. We will continue to represent its interests and continue to work with it for the betterment of all people in our province.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="509913">Mr. Speaker, in terms of net advantage the hon. member, the <Affiliation DbId="79003" Type="96">Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency</Affiliation> said that this would provide a net benefit deal for all provinces. Unfortunately, to opt into the new equalization strategy formula, as proposed by the government under budget 2007, the province of Newfoundland and Labrador would have to agree to lose $238 million in the upcoming fiscal year. Also we would lose $101 million this past fiscal year and an additional $25 million next year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509914">However, the province of Nova Scotia would gain $95 million, according to the minister, if it were to opt into the new equalization formula, a formula that basically has two decision points in it, either a full exemption of non-renewables or a 50% exemption of non-renewables.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509915">Is the minister saying, because this is a very interesting point, that it could gain $95 million this year? We know that in years to come, under the new formula, it could lose more money relative to what it would achieve under the Atlantic accord. Could it move back to the old Atlantic accord should that be a more beneficial circumstance for the province of Nova Scotia?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="509917">However, again, the choice is clear. I want to point out, as my hon. friend did, that the province of Newfoundland and Labrador is a different situation. In fact, it has garnered a great deal more from the Atlantic accord. Because of the reserves that exist in its offshore, it has been a much larger beneficiary of the agreement with the federal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509918">The province of Nova Scotia has yet to realize the full potential. It has Sable I and II. The Deep Panuke project has yet to live up to the billing, but we remain hopeful. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509919">Therefore, that choice exists for Nova Scotia. I suggest it is beneficial to our province, and it is one that will be made. That is also in addition to other deals yet to be worked out around infrastructure spending, the Atlantic gateway initiative and issues related to health, and let us not forget the environment. </ParaText>

During the campaign, and in discussions in the past couple of months, the decision was made that we would try to come together across the country to fix the fiscal imbalance. For two decades, parties on all sides had been talking about it, but the party on this side of the House said that it would try to do something about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509939">We opted to take into consideration the recommendations by an independent panel, referred to by most as the O'Brien report. If we remember, that report called for a cap to be put on the payments of revenues going to each province. In budget 2007 there is no cap on the revenues coming from the Atlantic accord. I do not know how many times we have to say it on this side of the House. A cap does not exist on the Atlantic accord.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509940">For the next number of years, there will be no clawback in any way on the Atlantic accord in Newfoundland and Labrador. One hundred per cent of the revenues that are generated from its oil and gas offshore will go into the coffers of Newfoundland and Labrador.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509941">If in 2010-11 or 2011-12 Newfoundland and Labrador is still on equalization, the Atlantic accord then extends out to 2020. This is the concern that we raised as members on this side of the House. I was very surprised, knowing full well that this debate was ongoing in my province and in Canada with regard to the fiscal imbalance, that not a question was raised by the members from Newfoundland and Labrador in the House, regarding what the plan was or if a solution would be put forward to the concerns raised in our province.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509942">On this side of the House, myself and my two colleagues continuously raised the concern about the issue with the Atlantic accord. We made sure that a cap was not put in place and that the benefits of the Atlantic accord would continue to the people of Newfoundland and Labrador.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="509951">The government decided against the recommendation in the O'Brien report to put a cap on the Atlantic accords and we gave Newfoundland and Labrador another option that the rest of the country would not have under this new equalization program. That option is to stay with the Atlantic accord, receive no clawback and that could extend until 2020. That is the concern we have on this side of the House.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="55">(1655)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="509952">I just want to go back and talk about the Atlantic accord once again. When the accord offset agreement was negotiated, the province and the federal government agreed to an expiry date, which will come, as I mentioned earlier, as soon as 2011-12 or as late as 2020, depending on whether Newfoundland and Labrador is still entitled to receive equalization in 2011-12. That is my concern and the bone of contention I guess that has been raised, and it concerns the level of equalization payment we receive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509953">I was in a hotel ballroom in 1985 when the original Atlantic accord was signed. It was a proud day in the history of Newfoundland and Labrador. As I said earlier, I was also involved and part of the government of Newfoundland and Labrador when the Atlantic accord was signed, another proud day in the history of Newfoundland and Labrador.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509954">However, I say with all sincerity that I will be prouder than I have ever been before if I could stand in this House here or stand anywhere in Newfoundland and Labrador and say that we are off equalization, that our province does not need equalization anymore, and that Ottawa can keep the cheque. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509955">That is the goal that we should all be working toward, not creating the divisions that we are creating here, but working toward the fact that Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia, and any other province that receives equalization can stand up someday, sooner than later, and say they do not need the cheque from Ottawa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509956">We have the opportunity to do that in Newfoundland and Labrador. We have the opportunity to do that through developments like: the Lower Churchill, Hebron, Hibernia extensions, a second oil refinery, the fishery, major mineral potential throughout Newfoundland and Labrador, and untapped tourism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509957">In order for these to work, in order for these industries to grow, so that we can take in the revenue from them and not be dependent on equalization, we need cooperation between the federal government and the provincial government. We need cost share programs that get these projects off the ground, that put the money into Newfoundland and Labrador, so we can reap the benefit from it, so that the sons and the daughters of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians are not on planes going to Fort McMurray and other parts of this country. We need them to stay in Newfoundland, continue to work in Newfoundland, and continue to generate the revenue that we need in Newfoundland and Labrador. That is what we should all be working toward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509958">We have many opportunities here. I would like to be able to stand in this House and be proud of the fact that we can tell Ottawa that we do not need its cheques anymore. The reason why Newfoundland and Labrador and many of the other provinces are still living in the world of a fiscal imbalance is because for a decade or more, the transfers to Newfoundland and Labrador were gutted by the former government. Health care, education, social assistance, all of these were gutted. Therefore, it created a fiscal imbalance in our province from which we are still trying to crawl out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509959">We have the opportunity here through the Atlantic accord to continue taking 100% of our oil and gas revenues and putting them into the coffers of Newfoundland and Labrador. By doing that until 2011-12, or until 2020, we will have a day in Newfoundland and Labrador when we can say to Ottawa, “Keep the cheque, we do not need it, we are off the equalization, standing on our own two feet. We are proud Newfoundlanders and Labradorians and we do not need the help anymore”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509960">That is the goal that all members on both sides of this House and in both levels of government, whether it is here in Ottawa or it is Newfoundland and Labrador, should be working toward because then the whole question is answered because then we are standing on our own two feet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509961">I hope that by working together with all members here that we can continue to do that and then equalization cheques can stay in Ottawa. We can stand on our own two feet in Newfoundland and Labrador and be the proud Newfoundlanders and Labradorians that we continue to be.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="509984">First, because of the good fiscal management the previous Liberal government and the hard work of Canadians, we have roughly <?bk?>$10 billion<?ek?> extra to spend on our budget. So what happened at the cabinet table? Why do we lose money instead of gaining money when the budget was done? What does it mean when equalization payments are cut and regions in our province have to do with less?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509985">In terms of money, what do we lose? The provinces have less money for roads. They have less money for social assistance, funds for schools, hospitals, and also for farmers. It means that our people are not given the tools and the resources to live dignified lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509986">Not only have we been left out of meaningful amounts of transfer payments in the Atlantic provinces but we also noticed, over the last year and a half, all the cuts that were made on our social payments. It is unbelievable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509987">Where is the money for the Atlantic Canada gateway initiative? The hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78900" Type="2">Central Nova</Affiliation> talked about it. It is not in the budget. We do not see the money. We do not see the announcement of that money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509988">He talks about the future of oil and gas. That is unknown. We want to see the money now. We want to see the $10 billion share.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509989">Where is the money for the small craft harbours? It is not mentioned in the budget. Something happened at that cabinet table. The Atlantic cabinet ministers must have been left out. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509990">Let me recap. The taxpayers of Canada have given the Conservative government $10 billion more to work with and the government never gave a cent to Atlantic Canada. Why are the Conservatives entrusted with this money? Why are they neglecting Atlantic Canada?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="509991">Let me be clear. The Conservative Atlantic MPs over there, on the opposite side, should do the honourable thing and vote against this budget and stand up for Atlantic Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="510156">Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege for me to discuss Bill <Document DbId="2195279" Type="3">C-293</Document> which is much awaited by groups working in the field of international cooperation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510157"> This bill sets out criteria respecting resource allocation to international development agencies and enhances transparency and monitoring of Canada’s international development efforts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510158"> First, I must explain the context surrounding this bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510159"> In her February 2005 report, the Auditor General of Canada raised a number of questions concerning the management of CIDA. Among other comments, the report set out the following observations: CIDA has sharply increased the use of grants rather than contributions to fund aid projects; a situation that was troubling at the time because, to some degree, CIDA was sacrificing a degree of control and oversight over how recipients spend CIDA funding. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510160"> CIDA also makes grants without prior evaluation of needs. CIDA does not audit any in-kind contributions. Of 19 files reviewed, 12 mentioned this type of contribution, but for 11 of those, there was no indication that CIDA had done any analysis to determine their real value. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510161"> In addition, only 3 of 19 agreements audited noted that CIDA had considered the cost elements of the project, in order to verify that there was no provision for profit by the recipient. Finally, according to the Auditor General, CIDA needed to strengthen its current practices concerning audit adjustments, because it was possible that the agency was reimbursing unauthorized expenditures. These criticisms by the Auditor General made it clear that there were a number of shortcomings in CIDA’s accountability and transparency. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510162"> This bill contains two important elements. First, it defines development assistance and second, it defines the framework for providing such assistance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510163"> Development assistance must first contribute to a reduction in poverty. It must also take account of the opinions of the poor. It must be compatible with international standards of human rights and it must, necessarily and absolutely, include mechanisms for consultation and the production of reports that are available to every citizen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510164"> That means that in order to contribute to a reduction of poverty, the government must calculate its official development assistance budget by taking into account only the criteria that are defined in this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510165"> As for the reduction of poverty, certainly over the past 25 years we have witnessed a significant decline in world poverty. With the appearance of new economic powers such as China and India, thousands of people have got out of their impoverished state and have been able to access education, live as equals and satisfy their hunger. It remains, however, that the situation has also worsened in some other countries, and that we are still far from a world in which everyone has enough to eat and the infant mortality rate is comparable to rates in the western world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510166"> In 2005, the then Secretary-General of the UN, Kofi Annan, published a report in which he indicated his intention to strengthen the UN. His three major themes were: the freedom from want, the freedom from fear and the freedom to live in dignity. This was a program that demanded fundamental reforms of the organization itself, notably the expansion of the Security Council.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510167"> With regard to the main points of this bill, the Bloc Québécois supported Kofi Annan's plan to implement measures that would enable all peoples of the world to live free of want, that is, to make the right to development a reality for everyone and to free all humanity from want. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510168"> In Canada, the Canadian International Development Agency’s goal is to support the efforts of developing countries to improve their social and economic prospects. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="00">(1800)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="510169"> Also, it is written on the CIDA site that its mandate is to reduce poverty and to contribute to a more secure, equitable, and prosperous world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510170"> The Bloc Québécois totally agrees with CIDA that it should reduce poverty in the world. We also share the idea that this should take place in a context of sustainable development. Canada, through its development assistance, must ensure sustainability for the local population. It would be too easy to adopt solutions that produce immediate results but that would be sources of problems for future generations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510171"> This being said, the wording of the bill left us a bit puzzled during second reading. The bill says, in clause 2: </ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">—that all Canadian development assistance abroad is provided with a central focus on poverty reduction—</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510173"> We would have liked the bill to contain a provision broadening as much as possible the meaning of the word “poverty”. What meaning do we give to the struggle against poverty in development assistance? We believe that the reduction of poverty must also include its underlying factors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510174"> Poverty is not only a matter of money, it is also a social issue. That is why we think that the UN’s millennium goals are the frame of reference that would enable us to better identify the work required to actually alleviate poverty. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510175"> There are eight millennium goals: eradicate extreme poverty and hunger; achieve universal primary education; promote gender equality and empower women; reduce female mortality ; improve maternal health; combat HIV-AIDS, malaria and other diseases; ensure environmental sustainability; and develop a global partnership for development. Only two of those eight goals appear in the bill: eradicating poverty and sustainable development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510176">Although the millennium goals are all related to poverty, we believe we have to go much farther. For example, outbreaks of certain diseases are often due to unsanitary conditions, inadequate investment in health and so on. Although they are all connected, the UN goals focus on specific problems and must be addressed independently to enable development in countries that receive Canadian assistance. We must never forget that poverty often results from socio-economic inequalities within a country. In that regard, we submitted an amendment to the committee stipulating that any measures to address poverty take into account the underlying factors, such as health, education and equality. Our amendment was rejected. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510177">I have only two minutes left but I have so much more to say. We support this bill because we think that we need to find out what poor people think. At some point, we will also have to discuss Canadian values. The Bloc Québécois wholeheartedly supports this bill, a bill it helped create. This bill will ensure that official development assistance focuses on reducing poverty. In the current context, where poverty provides fertile ground for terrorism, we must act immediately. We do, however, believe there are other ways to fight terrorism. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510178">The purpose of this bill is to ensure that CIDA, in providing assistance, respects the environments in which it is helping people. CIDA will also require the government—and this is very important—to take the opinions of people in the field into account. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510179">We support this bill. We hope that all parliamentarians in this House will vote for it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="510180">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on this bill before the House today. Bill <Document DbId="2195279" Type="4">C-293, An Act respecting the provision of development assistance abroad</Document>, is an important piece of legislation. Although it is a private member's bill, I feel quite comfortable in saying that New Democrats will be supporting it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510181">I also want to acknowledge the tireless work of the member for <Affiliation DbId="78793" Type="2">Halifax</Affiliation>. She has spoken passionately about the importance of this bill before the House. In a previous Parliament, she introduced a private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="2152890" Type="4">C-243</Document>. I want to acknowledge the very good work done by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78793" Type="2">Halifax</Affiliation> on this particular piece of legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510182">Although this bill talks about issues such as looking at accountability and transparency and does not specifically address money, I think there is an important context to this bill. An <I>Embassy</I> article on March 21 talked about the fact that Canada's official development assistance level fell from 0.34% of GNP in 2005 to 0.33% last year. Barring any large changes, that number is expected to drop to 0.32% in 2007.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510183">As the needs are increasing throughout the world, we see that Canada's commitment is actually dropping off. Many of us have supported the 0.7% allocation for aid and we would encourage all members of the House to work hard in that direction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510184">I want to address a couple of issues about why this private member's bill is so important. I will refer to some of the work that the Stephen Lewis Foundation has been doing. It has been doing a tremendous amount of work around the grandmothers to grandmothers campaign. This highlights the need for this particular piece of legislation. I will read for members from an article from one of the websites:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="510188">This is an effort by a number of groups throughout Canada. I want to talk about one in particular from my own riding in Nanaimo.

These include reducing household waste, reducing HIV-AIDS, improving forest fire management, and developing ecotourism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510194">The intent of this project is to work with partners in Ghana to develop outreach programs and other strategies aimed at providing rural communities with the knowledge and skills needed to effectively address the four project areas described above.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510195">It is these very good local initiatives that are so important in supporting citizens in other countries in their desperate struggles around poverty, sickness and lack of access to clean drinking water. Many of these things have been outlined in the millennium development goals. It is very important that we in Canada continue to support this good work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510196"> I want to talk a bit more about the reality of HIV-AIDS and again about why accountability and transparency are so important in the dollars we are sending overseas. On the grandmothers to grandmothers website, they talk about “key statistics on orphans, grandmothers and HIV-AIDS”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510197">These are global figures. The number of people living with HIV-AIDS in 2006 was 39.5 million worldwide, and 24.7 million in sub-Saharan Africa. The number of women living with AIDS in 2006 was 17.7 million worldwide, and 13.3 million in sub-Saharan Africa. The number of people newly infected with HIV in 2006 was <?bk?>4.3 million<?ek?> worldwide, and 2.8 million in sub-Saharan Africa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510198">Those are generations of people that we are losing. In many cases what we are talking about is the hollowing out of the working people. We are talking about losing people between the ages of 18 to 49. In Africa, those are the most productive years of people's lives. Those are the mothers and the fathers, the workers, the farmers and the truck drivers. Africa is losing that entire generation, thus passing on that burden to the grandmothers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510199">The article goes on to talk about the fact that sub-Saharan Africa has 10% of the world's population but makes up more than 60% of all people living with HIV. In sub-Saharan Africa alone, approximately 13 million children have been orphaned by AIDS, a higher number than the total of every girl and boy under 18 in Canada, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Ireland combined. That figure is expected to reach more than 18 million children by 2010.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510200">According to HelpAge International, older women are the backbone of AIDS care. In some countries in sub-Saharan Africa, between 40% to 60% of orphans live in grandparent-headed households, with the vast majority of these grandmothers. Over 50% of orphaned children live in grandparent-headed households in Botswana and Malawi and over 60% in Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510201"> These are frightening figures. If we can encourage members of this House to support this important piece of private members' business now before the House so we have a quality of life in other countries, so we can say with some confidence that we are completely behind the millennium development goals, and so we are urging this House and all Canadians to support the 0.7%, it would be an important step. We could hold our heads up high in the international community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510202">As it is, Canada continues to fall behind the goals that have been set by many people in this country, including the make poverty history campaign. I would urge each and every member of this House to support this private member's bill, to say yes and demonstrate that we can be leaders in the international community.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="510203">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to participate in this debate on a very important private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="2195279" Type="4">C-293</Document> sponsored by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78463" Type="2">Scarborough—Guildwood</Affiliation>. I would like to congratulate him for an excellent piece of legislation which I certainly will be supporting. Any time we can bring more accountability and transparency to the Government of Canada, to the Parliament of Canada, that is a very good thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510204">I would like to note that one of my constituents, Mr. Sharif Salla, wrote me a note and asked me to support this bill. It is not often that a constituent, at least in my experience, writes in to support a private member's bill, but I will be supporting it for that reason and for a host of other reasons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510205">The bill sets out what the government should be doing with respect to official development assistance, or overseas development assistance as some people would call it. It states:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510206">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Development assistance may be provided only if the competent minister is of the opinion that it (a) contributes to poverty reduction; (b) takes into account the perspectives of the poor; and (c) is consistent with Canada's international human rights obligations.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510207">There is one piece missing. I have spoken to my colleague, but obviously the committee and the House at this point have not considered it a valid argument, but I think it still is. I would add a fourth criteria which would be that the recipient country practises good governance and is committed to the fight against corruption. I think it is a very important point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510208">The member for <Affiliation DbId="78928" Type="2">Nanaimo—Cowichan</Affiliation> talked about the work that Malaspina College is doing with the country of Ghana. Ghana is a country that has committed to the fight against corruption. I had the great pleasure to meet President John Kufuor. Many of my constituents are from Ghana originally. He is an honest man, a good man. It is coming right from the top that Ghana is committed to fighting corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510209"> We need to be mindful of that because Canadians and indeed people around the world are sick and tired of sending money to countries only to have the money ripped off by greedy leaders who stash away huge amounts in offshore banking centres or they launder the money domestically and buy votes. We cannot tolerate that any more, where 50¢ dollars that are going into countries for overseas development assistance just are not good enough. The bill goes a long way to bringing more accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510210"> One of the criteria is that it contribute to poverty reduction. That is a very noble, very necessary criteria, but it is a vexing question. How can that be measured? The measurement process is very difficult, but it is still an objective that we need to keep in our sights and we need to keep working on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510211">A few years ago I had the great honour as a member of a subcommittee of the finance committee and the international affairs committee to meet in Washington, D.C. with Robert McNamara who had served as president of the World Bank and of course as secretary of defense in the U.S. government. In his role as president of the World Bank, we asked him how accountable could our Canadian dollars be going through these development organizations, the multilaterals, or even our bilateral assistance, how could we be assured that it was reducing poverty? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510212">That gentleman who was president of the World Bank for seven or eight years said that was a very difficult and challenging question because there are so many other variables. If development assistance goes into a country the next year, there could be flooding, or there could be five years of drought, or there could be a conflict. How do we take out those variables and measure whether the development assistance that went to that country actually reduced poverty or did not? Notwithstanding that, it is an important criteria.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510213">I am somewhat surprised that from time to time when we look at development assistance we do not spend enough attention looking at the question of corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510214"> I recently read a book by Jeffrey Sachs who is a special adviser at the United Nations. He advises the UN on how to reach the millennium development goals, which are the goals to reduce poverty worldwide.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="20">(1820)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="510215">In his book, <I>The End of Poverty</I> which is some 300 pages, I looked up the word “corruption” in the index. Sadly, I could not find the word “corruption”. In fact, in his whole book when he talks about development assistance and fighting poverty, there is not one mention of the word “corruption”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510216">I have had the opportunity over the years to be very involved with the Global Organization of Parliamentarians Against Corruption. It has 700 members of Parliament worldwide and is represented in around 70 countries. It was actually my colleague across the floor from St. Albert who took the initiative to get this organization going. There is a lot of momentum. We are including more and more parliamentarians around the world, those parliamentarians who are committed to the fight against corruption and are committed to doing something about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510217">I would like to put some context to corruption. I did some work, for example, to look at the correlation between poverty and corruption. There is a high level of correlation. It is in the 90% range. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510218">The problem is we know there is a high correlation between poverty and corruption, but we do not really know which comes first, whether the poverty comes first and that drives the corruption, or whether the corruption comes first and that drives the poverty. There is actually no reasonable way to try to come to grips with that and try to deduce that, but we do know there is a high correlation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510219">I was attending some debates in Europe one time and members of Parliament in Europe were arguing that poverty drives corruption. I think that is true to some extent, particularly at the lower levels of what we call petty corruption, petty bribery, where people have to pay so many rand, rupees or shillings to get a permit to do this, that and the other thing. If the people who are working in those departments are not paid anything, they are expected to take bribes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510220">When leaders of countries, whether they are elected leaders or officials, are salting away millions and billions of dollars into Swiss bank accounts, I am sorry, this is not driven by poverty; this is driven by greed. I have a few examples of some of the people over the years. This is only a partial list of leaders of countries who have salted away billions of dollars. The amounts are not really in dispute. They are pretty well widely acknowledged. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510221">For example, President Suharto of Indonesia salted away between $15 billion and $35 billion U.S. Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines salted away about $5 billion to $10 billion. Mobutu Sese Seko from Zaire, $5 billion. Sani Abacha from Nigeria, $5 billion. Slobodan Milosevic from Yugoslavia, $1 billion. Mr. Duvalier from Haiti, $300 million to $800 million. Alberto Fujimori, Peru, $600 million. Pavlo Lazarenko from Ukraine, $114 million to $200 million. Arnoldo Aleman from Nicaragua, $100 million. Mr. Estrada from the Philippines, $78 million to $80 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510222">If we look at the range of those and total them up, we are looking at a figure of $32 billion to a high of $58 billion. These are just some of the leaders of these countries, impoverished countries I might add, and I will come back to that in a moment. The leaders of those impoverished countries have salted away millions. Interestingly, the list does not include President Daniel arap Moi in Kenya who salted away, it is pretty well acknowledged, $3 billion to $4 billion U.S. Imagine how many hospitals and schools that kind of money would buy in Kenya.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510223">It is estimated that corruption can add 8% to the cost of doing business in a corrupt country. In a country such as the People's Republic of China, it is estimated that corruption accounts for about 15% of GDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510224">This is an issue that we have to deal with. I was going to talk about the correlation between poverty and corruption more precisely, but I will not have time to do that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510225">I would like to think that perhaps my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78463" Type="2">Scarborough—Guildwood</Affiliation> would consider a friendly amendment, which would now have to be done in the other place I gather, that would add the good governance criteria to the three criteria that he has in the bill now which are excellent ones. I think we need not delude ourselves that if a country is corrupt and it has no commitment to good governance, we are sending tax dollars into an area where we are making the rich and the corrupt more rich and more corrupt, and we are not really lifting out of poverty the people that are in poverty, those very people that we are trying to reach.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="510310">Mr. Speaker, I know I am not going to have enough time for everything I would like to say. However, Canadians will no doubt be in awe that a member of the Liberal caucus would rise in the House to cast stones in a debate on the ethical use of public funds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510311"> Over the past 13 months, the new government has been restoring the faith of Quebeckers and the faith of all Canadians, which the Liberals broke over the past 13 years. Quebeckers and Canadians are relieved to have a government that respects them. For the member to think that they have already forgotten her and her party's arrogant abuse of taxpayers' money is completely wishful thinking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510312"> Canadians have not forgotten the $1 billion boondoggle. Canadians have not forgotten Shawinigate. They have not forgotten Auberge Grand-Mère. Canadians have not forgotten Jean Brault, Alfonso Gagliano, or all those brown envelopes stuffed with cash being exchanged at Restaurant Frank, and certainly neither have Quebeckers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510313">This is the Liberals' legacy for HRSDC. Each of these scandals shows that Liberals did with HRSDC what they will do if they are ever in charge again. The corruption was on their watch. The scandals were on their watch. The culture of entitlement was on their watch.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510314">The member for <Affiliation DbId="78353" Type="2">Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine</Affiliation>'s Liberal Party orchestrated one of the greatest scandals in Canadian history. Canadians grew tired of it. After 13 years of being treated with contempt by the Liberals, Canadians went to the polls and asked us to govern. They asked the Conservatives to form the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510315"> We are rewarding their decision by bringing them good and accountable government. The former minister's expenses met Treasury Board guidelines. Can the member say the same for ad scam?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510316">I must say that the minister the member is talking about replaced five Liberal ministers. Canadians will not be duped by the member into comparisons of us with the Liberals' rotten apples, but if the member prefers Canadians to look only at the former minister's expenses and compare them to the spending of Liberal HRSDC ministers, she had better be careful about what she wishes for. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510317">Measured over the same period of one year, HRSDC ministers' spending under the Liberals was 7.5 times more than the former minister's. The Liberals spent approximately $247,000, while the former minister spent approximately $32,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510318">With only a fraction of the former minister's portfolio, the Liberal social development minister spent about $62,000 before Canadians retired his number. The Liberal housing minister spent over $69,000. These ministers each spent twice as much as the former minister over the same period of time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510319">What do they have to show for it but a litany of broken promises, a record of scandals and 13 years of corruption?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510320"> If Canadians were asked to compare expenses of former Liberal ministers and their staff in one year to what this minister spent for one year, they would see that Liberals cost them 96 times more, and the Liberals did not have 96 ministers in their cabinet. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510321">It may also be instructive to compare the former minister's expenses to those of the <Affiliation DbId="105458" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>, whom that member supported for the leadership of the Liberals. Documents show that her candidate for leader of the Liberal Party, the person she puts forward as her choice to set an example for the Liberals, who want so badly to form the government again, opted to lodge at a hotel just blocks away from his residence in Montreal when Canada hosted a Kyoto conference. The cost to taxpayers of his decision not to walk a few blocks was over $5,500. His decision to drive to Montreal and keep a chauffeur in the city was over $14,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510322"> By whatever brush the member wants to use, she cannot and will not be able to whitewash the Liberals' broken promises, record of scandals and 13 years of corruption that easily.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="510332">I have several questions for the minister in the very few minutes that are allotted to me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510333">First, I would like to know why the minister is ignoring the will of this House that adopted recommendations in the 43rd report of the procedure and House affairs committee of the 38th Parliament, including a recommendation to broadly consult with Canadians on the values and principles that they would like to see in our electoral system? Canadians expect their government to be open and accountable, but this government has hijacked the process that was agreed upon in the past.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510334">Second, can the minister explain to us why, after saying he did not want the process taken over by special interest groups, he contracted it out to a special interest group? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510335">The Frontier Centre for Public Policy is well known as a right-wing think tank and has several articles opposing electoral reform on its website. It is hardly an unbiased group to convene a series of focus groups across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510336">Was it the only group that applied for the job of convening the focus groups? Was the process even open for other facilitators to apply for this opportunity? Those are just a couple of questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510337">I would also like the <Affiliation DbId="105837" Type="4">Minister for Democratic Reform</Affiliation> to tell Canadians what criteria he used to select the 40 people for the first focus group? Are they selected from certain segments of the population? Are they representative in any way? Did he put an ad in a paper or on a government website and did they apply to come to the discussion? How does one know where to go to be a part of this hand-picked, closed-door process?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510338">Canadians are not fooled by the government. They know that real civic engagement does not happen behind closed doors. If the minister really wanted participation, he would support Motion No. 262.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510339">I ask again, will the minister now admit that his sham process of bogus civic engagement is a waste of energy? Will he do the right thing, withdraw the electoral reform from that process and commit to full citizens' consultation across Canada?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="510340">Mr. Speaker, I must say that I reject entirely the premise that the member makes that the process we are engaging in is not open and transparent. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510341">In fact, I find it amazing that a member of the New Democratic Party would actually bring this forward because in the procedure and House affairs committee, it was the government that presented a motion that in effect would have members of the procedure and House affairs committee travel across Canada in a parallel consultation exercise to the one that we have already announced. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510342">Yet, do members know what happened when we put that motion? The NDP voted against it. The NDP, the Bloc and four out of the five Liberals voted against it. The only member who voted with us was the Liberal member for <Affiliation DbId="78521" Type="2">Vancouver Quadra</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510343">We wanted to ensure that the committee members who represent the procedure and House affairs committee in this House had an opportunity to travel across Canada and engage Canadians in the very process that the member is suggesting, or at least she had suggested in her bill. Yet, her own party voted against that motion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510344">I find it, frankly, more than a little hypocritical to suggest now that the consultation process that we have started and announced on January 9 is not open and transparent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510345">Let us reflect again exactly what is going to happen in that consultation process. There will be meetings across Canada. There will be 12 meetings, one in each of the 10 provinces, one for the territories and a separate consultation process for what we call a youth meeting. At each one of these meetings, there will be 40 members who are selected to represent the broad demographic, cultural and other ranges of the clientele or the population within that region. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="510347">However, to add to that process, once again I say that we wanted to have parliamentarians engaged in the same process in a parallel stream. Yet, what happened? The member's own party voted against that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510348">I can only stand here in amazement and suggest to the member that perhaps if she was truly serious about engaging this consultation process, she should have a discussion with her own members who sat on that committee and question them as to why they voted against our motion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="510349">Mr. Speaker, the minister knew in December that I had put my Motion No. 262 on the national agenda, but in January, while all the members of this House were on a Christmas break, on holidays and in their ridings, he introduced his sham of an electoral reform process and awarded the contract to his friends. Talk about an open process. My goodness, it is starting off behind closed doors already.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510350">A little over a month later, he came to the procedure and House affairs committee and asked it to vote for something that was done behind closed doors. Of course, we voted against that process. It was bogus. It is a sham. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510351">We support true civic engagement and that was what was put forward in the last Parliament, in the 43rd report of the procedure and House affairs committee. We will be voting to honour the work that was done in that committee by Ed Broadbent and many others to have true engagement of citizens across this country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="510352">Mr. Speaker, once again, my hon. colleague is completely off the mark. When we made the announcement January 9 of a citizens' consultation process, it was not awarded to friends of the minister, as she suggested. If she does suggest that, I would invite her to take that outside and make that accusation. There was a request for a proposal. It was an open tendered process. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510353">However again, the second part of her supplemental question suggested that we came to the committee with a recommendation that was rejected. That is the farthest thing from the truth. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510354">At committee, we entertained a separate motion that would allow members of the committee to travel across Canada to engage in a parallel citizens' consultation process. This was not staged. There would be representation from the New Democratic Party, as well as the Bloc, the Liberals and the Conservatives. That consultation process would have been there to engage all citizens, but her members, members of the Liberal Party and the Bloc voted against it.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="510355">Mr. Speaker, on March 2 I asked the <Affiliation DbId="78775" Type="4">Minister for la Francophonie and Official Languages</Affiliation> how she could be satisfied with the <I>National Defence Official Languages Program Transformation Model </I> of October 2006 when Graham Fraser, the Official Languages Commissioner, pointed out in committee that the best a unilingual francophone soldier could hope for in the Canadian armed forces is to be an infantry soldier at Valcartier. He went on to say that evidently it is possible for a unilingual anglophone to rise to the rank of brigadier general.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510356">The Commissioner also stated, “It is practically impossible to establish a challenging career in the Canadian Forces if you are a unilingual Francophone”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510357">In response to my questions about this situation, the insulting reply by the parliamentary secretary, the Conservative member for <Affiliation DbId="78507" Type="2">Beauport—Limoilou</Affiliation>, was quite discriminatory for francophones in Quebec and Canada: “—the Bloc throws its little temper tantrum”. Such language truly shows little regard for la Francophonie in Quebec and Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510358">It is an insult to anyone concerned about the rights of francophones to have to endure the disgraceful attitude of the federal government regarding its obligations with respect to official languages in the Canadian armed forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510359">It is even more insulting to hear the <Affiliation DbId="78775" Type="4">Minister for la Francophonie and Official Languages</Affiliation> say in this House that she had the backing of the Official Languages Commissioner in developing this new direction. Commissioner Graham Fraser's response to this was as follows: “Neither Dyane Adam (his predecessor) nor I have endorsed this new functional approach”. It is shameful of the minister and the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78491" Type="2">Louis-Saint-Laurent</Affiliation> and of the Conservative government. Seeking credibility from people who are concerned about la Francophonie in Quebec and Canada by telling such a falsehood speaks volumes about the moral value of their linguistic approach to our soldiers and our francophone soldiers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510360">With the Canadian Forces turning around and no longer requiring its high ranking officials to be bilingual, the Conservative government is showing its reformist side from the Manning days and its Alliance side from the days of the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78682" Type="2">Okanagan—Coquihalla</Affiliation>, and is not fulfilling its responsibilities under the Official Languages Act. This is further evidence that the <Affiliation DbId="78775" Type="4">Minister for la Francophonie and Official Languages</Affiliation> accepts this irresponsible turnaround when it comes to the Canadian Forces honouring their responsibilities under the Official Languages Act. The Canadian Forces official languages track record was bad enough when the Liberals were in power.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="510364">Mr. Speaker, allow me, first, to assure the House that the Minister of National Defence and the Canadian Forces recognize the importance of official languages and are determined to improve their performance in this field. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510365"> The transformation model establishes the Canadian Forces’ official languages strategic vision, which will ensure that members of the Canadian Forces are to be consistently led, trained, administered and supported in their official language of choice, in accordance with the requirements of the Official Languages Act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510366">There is a myth that the Official Languages Act requires each member of the Canadian Forces to be bilingual. Even members of the public service are not all required to be bilingual. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510367"> I can assure the House that there is nothing to prevent francophone members of the Canadian Forces from gaining promotion. That is a false notion concerning the transformation model. There will be no negative impact on the professional advancement of francophones. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510368"> The transformation model will have a positive impact on the careers of both anglophones and francophones. Indeed, francophones are well represented in the Canadian Forces. In 2005-06, the percentage of francophones in the Canadian Forces was higher than the percentage of francophones in the Canadian population. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510369"> French is the mother tongue of about one-quarter of the Canadian population, while 27.4% of the members of the Canadian Forces are francophones. More than 27% of the members of the forces are francophones, including 28% of general officers and 33% of chief warrant officers and chief petty officers, first class. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510370"> Francophones are very well represented in the Canadian Forces and they will continue to be well represented in the future. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510371"> They are not only well represented at subordinate levels, but also in the higher levels of the Canadian Forces. Being a francophone in no way prevents a member of the military from advancing to higher ranks in the armed forces. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510372"> Ensuring that military personnel can be trained in their official language of choice is a priority of the Canadian Forces. That is why one of the priorities of the transformation model is to create a core of bilingual military instructors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510373"> All training for recruits is offered in both official languages. While there is still work to be done, the Canadian Forces have made progress in offering training courses in both official languages. In 2005-06, some 21.6% of all courses were offered in French or in both official languages, an increase over the 18% of courses in 2004-05. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510374"> The new Official Languages Transformation Model will bring the Canadian Forces more completely in line with the requirements of the Official Languages Act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510375"> It includes a new method for determining whether military and civilian personnel of the Department of National Defence are fulfilling their official language obligations in the workplace. We will thus be better able to address and take measures to remedy any problems more quickly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510376"> I am convinced that the transformation model will enable us to resolve the issues raised by the Commissioner of Official Languages and to allay the concerns of those who have raised questions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="510377"> Implementation of this plan will ensure a fairer and more equitable environment in which members of the Canadian Forces, anglophones as well as francophones, will be able to work and learn in the official language of their choice, in accordance with the Official Languages Act. </ParaText>
