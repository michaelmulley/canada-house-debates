            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="78945" Type="18" Desc="">Ms. Diane Ablonczy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="13220">Mr. Speaker, it is a real honour to stand and introduce Bill C-13, the budget implementation act. The purpose of Bill C-13, of course, is to implement the measures announced in budget 2006.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13221"> The measures contained in this bill were outlined by the finance minister in his speech in this House on May 2. These measures will make a real difference to Canadians, because in implementing this year's budget, Bill C-13 focuses on our new government's promises and priorities, delivers real results to people and lays a solid foundation for Canada's future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13222">Before I talk more about how budget 2006 and the measures in this bill fulfill our promises to Canadians, it is important to note first that this government is aware of the variables involved in budget planning. I am talking about variables such as changes in commodity prices, especially in the energy sector, or the variable of an appreciating dollar under pressure from global current account imbalances, reflecting, for example, developments in the U.S.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13223">That is why our new government's budget plan is based on and delivers fiscal discipline. It does this by providing a clear, responsible agenda to build a better Canada, starting by addressing the five priorities set out in the Speech from the Throne. These priorities are: cleaning up government by improving accountability; lowering taxes for working Canadians; protecting Canadian families and communities; supporting parents' choice in child care; and delivering the health care Canadians need by developing a patient wait times guarantee with the provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13224">I would now like to illustrate just how budget 2006 has supported each of these priorities and the promises we made to Canadians with respect to the priorities. At the same time, I will also show how the proposals contained in this bill fit into the big picture of helping to build a solid foundation for Canada's future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13225">First, budget 2006 responds to this government's priority of improving accountability. This budget builds on the reforms of the federal accountability action plan, the very first piece of legislation introduced by our new government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13226"> Improving accountability means, for example, that our budget decisions will be implemented over the next two years. In contrast, Liberal plans were spread out over five years and most of the measures barely took effect until the back end of those five years. Of course, anything or nothing might happen if promises are made that will not be kept for five long years. By contrast, measures in the bill before the House today have been introduced by our government because they are affordable now, ready to be implemented now and will take effect by next year, not half a decade from now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13227">Also, budget 2006 proposes to restrain the growth of spending, which exploded upward to increase nearly 15% a year under the Liberals. It commits to a new approach to overall expenditure management. We are determined to ensure that programs are not just feel-good programs thrown out there for show in some kind of smoke and mirrors exercise, but that they really focus on results and deliver value for Canadians' hard-earned money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13228">To achieve better expenditure management, the President of the Treasury Board will identify $1 billion of savings in 2006-07 and in the next year, 2007-08. That is only one-half of 1% of total government spending in savings per year, but we think it is important that we continue to look for ways to save Canadians money. In the fall, in just a few weeks' time, the President of the Treasury Board will report his findings of where these savings can be achieved.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="05">(1005)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="13229">Also, our budget plans to reduce the public debt by $3 billion each year. As a result of this plan, the goal of lowering the debt to GDP ratio to 25% will be achieved one year earlier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13230">Budget 2006 also announces that the government will consider allocating a portion of any year-end surplus over $3 billion to the Canada pension plan and the Quebec pension plan. Of course, one of the main benefits of this action would be to improve fairness for younger Canadians by lowering contributions in the future for future generations of workers, and it would also help to fund the huge unfunded liability in those plans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13231">Financial reporting will be improved, with one example being federally funded foundations, which are now hidden from the taxpayers who fund them. This will be consistent with recommendations from the Auditor General.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13232">This government recognizes that Canadians pay too much tax. According to the Fraser Institute, while the average family's income has gone up 1,100% since 1961, its taxes have shot up a whopping 1,600%, outstripping the growth in income. Budget 2006 delivers more tax relief for people than the last four federal budgets combined. It puts twice as much resources into tax relief as it does into new spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13233">We feel this is only fair to Canadians who work hard to fund the programs of governments. In fact, 90% of the tax savings that we offer in this budget will go to individual Canadians and their families. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13234">We just have to look at the budget measures proposed in Bill C-13 that will put more money in the pockets of Canadians. To begin with, this bill delivers on the government's commitment to cut the GST by one percentage point, down to 6%, effective this July 1. This GST cut will benefit all Canadians by close to $9 billion over two years from that one reduction, even those who do not earn enough money to pay personal income tax. Very importantly, to provide relief to low and modest income Canadians, the budget keeps the GST credit at current levels even though the GST is being cut.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13235">That is not all. Bill C-13 also proposes a comprehensive plan to reduce personal income taxes for all taxpayers, starting with an increase in the basic personal amount. That is the amount that an individual can earn without paying any tax. We want to make sure that this amount grows each year and remains above the currently legislated levels into 2006, 2007 and beyond.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13236">In concert with this plan, Bill C-13 also proposes to permanently reduce the lowest personal income tax rate from 16% to 15.5% effective January 1, 2006. It also confirms that the rate will be 15% from January 1, 2005 to June 30, 2006. Together, these measures will provide personal income tax relief of almost $2.8 billion in this coming fiscal year, 2006-07, and a further $1.9 billion in 2007-08.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13237">We need to affirm and remind ourselves that working Canadians are the foundation of Canada's economic growth. However, choosing to work also means additional costs, costs for everything from uniforms to safety gear to home computers and various supplies. In recognition of these costs, budget 2006 will introduce the Canada employment credit. This is a new employment expense tax credit for employees' work expenses. The credit will significantly increase the amount of income that working Canadians can earn without paying federal income tax, to almost $10,000 by 2007.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="13238">Taken together, these measures will deliver almost $20 billion in tax relief for people over the next two years. As a result, about 655,000 low income Canadians, or two-thirds of a million Canadians, will be removed from the tax rolls.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13239">Budget 2006 also recognizes that creating an environment for more and better jobs and for strong economic growth depends on having a competitive tax system. The engines of our economy, our wealth creators, both large and small, should not have to go into the market square with the ball and chain of heavy taxes tied around their ankles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13240">Budget 2006 proposes the tax relief that we promised to Canadians. In fact, the same promises were made by the former government, but they were never delivered. We will deliver tax relief that will enable Canada's businesses to go into a fair fight with their competitors. Bill C-13 proposes a significant business tax relief plan that will reduce the general corporate income tax rate from 21% down to 19% by January 1, 2010. The bill also proposes to eliminate the corporate surtax for all corporations in 2008 and eliminate the federal capital tax as of January 1, 2006. That is two years ahead of schedule.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13241">These proposed cuts will allow Canada to regain the solid statutory tax advantage that we had prior to the 2004 tax changes with our biggest competitor, the United States. We are lowering taxes for working Canadians and also for Canadian job creators. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13242">Another of our government's five priorities is to protect Canadian families and communities. Canadians are proud of our country and our country's tradition of safe and security communities. We will take vigorous measures to keep our streets safe and our borders secure. To ensure that Canada remains safe and secure, budget 2006 allocates funding to hire 1,000 more RCMP officers and additional federal prosecutors to more effectively deal with drugs and gun smuggling. The budget also proposes to arm border officers and eliminate work alone posts. We want to stop the bad guys, not provide them free passage into our good country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13243">The budget provides needed funds to further improve Canada's pandemic preparedness. On top of that, budget 2006 commits to a total investment of over $5 billion to strengthen Canada's security forces, starting with more than $1 billion coming over the next two years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13244">Perhaps the priority that is most widely talked about in the 2006 budget is the universal child care plan. Hon. members will no doubt all agree that one of the most important investments government can make is to support families as they raise their children. That is why budget 2006 announced the kind of investments that will make a real difference to parents by providing more choice in child care for families with young children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13245">As a result of these budget measures, total direct federal support to families will be approximately $11.7 billion for this fiscal year, with the vast majority of benefits directed to low and middle income families. An integral part of that support for families is contained in Bill C-13. Specifically, it proposes $3.7 billion in funding over two years for the universal child care benefit, which will give all families $100 per month for each child under six. This benefit will help some 1.5 million families with over two million children. As well, budget 2006 proposes to invest $250 million each year, starting in 2007, in a new planned and practical initiative to actually increase the number of child care spaces for those who need them, by 25,000 each year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13246">The fifth priority of the new government is to ensure that all Canadians receive necessary medical treatment within medically acceptable waiting times. Budget 2006 includes a commitment to work with the provinces and territories to develop a wait times guarantee for medically necessary services.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="13247">Budget 2006 also announces new allocations of the $11.3 billion in equalization and $2.1 billion territorial formula financing for this year. These new allocations are based on the latest available fiscal and economic data. They give certainty to the provinces and territories and ensures that they will all benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13248">Six provinces and one territory will benefit directly from this decision compared to what they were advised, back in November 2005, they would receive. The government is also providing one time adjustments to fully offset the equalization and territorial formula financing declines that would have been experienced by two provinces and two territories under this decision. Bill C-13 sets out payment levels based on this new data and provides the funding for these one time adjustments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13249">Budget 2006 goes above and beyond our five priorities. For example, the government recognizes the difficulty some Canadians face when they must deal with a disability. In 2003 the technical advisory committee on tax measures for persons with disabilities was established to provide tax advice for persons with disabilities. The committee released its final report entitled “Disability Tax Fairness” in December 2004. It made 25 policy and administrative recommendations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13250">The government endorses the work of the committee. Budget 2006 proposes to fully implement these policy recommendations. Indeed, the bill goes beyond the committee's recommendations. Here are the measures proposed in Budget 2006 to assist Canadians with disabilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13251">Bill C-13 proposes to increase the maximum annual child disability benefit, effective January 2006. This benefit is a supplement to the Canada child tax benefit for children in low and modest income families who meet the eligibility criteria for the disability tax credit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13252">Effective July 2006, the bill also proposes to extend eligibility for the child disability benefit to middle and higher income families caring for a child who is eligible for the disability tax credit, including now all families that are currently eligible for the Canada child tax benefit base benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13253">We will also increase the maximum amount of the refundable medical expense supplement for the 2006 taxation year. The supplement improves work incentives for Canadians with disabilities by helping to offset the loss of coverage for medical and disability related expenses under social assistance when recipients move into the labour force.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13254">The government understands the challenges that families can face when dealing with a disability. The Minister of Finance will appoint a small group of experts to examine additional ways to help parents save for the long term financial security of a child with severe disabilities. We have asked these experts to provide their recommendations very quickly, within six months, because we intend to move ahead to support Canadians with disabilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13255">On still another front, this year's budget works to improve the environment in which we live. This includes funding to assist and build support systems. For example, Bill C-13 encourages charitable donations by eliminating the capital gains tax on donations of listed securities to public charities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13256">Unlike the previous Liberal government, which talked a lot about the environment while greenhouse gas emissions rose under its watch to 30% above the target, our government is committed to concrete actions that will deliver real results in Canada. We do not believe in spending billions of dollars offshore to keep on polluting here at home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13257">We will preserve natural areas by proposing to exempt donations of ecologically sensitive land from the capital gains tax.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="13258">These are only a few examples of the ways in which this new Conservative government is keeping its promises to stand up for Canada and for working class Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13259">As members can see, the government's first budget takes real action to keep promises and address core priorities. The measures contained in the bill would make a real difference to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13260">In summary, budget 2006 focuses on the priorities of Canadians, the measures they elected this government to deliver. The budget does deliver real results for Canadians and does so in a financially and fiscally responsible way. I therefore encourage all hon. members to accord the bill swift passage in the House of Commons.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="13261">Mr. Speaker, the day after the budget, my office received a call from a constituent from the riding of Brandon—Souris. He was very puzzled why the budget said his income tax rate would go down when in fact it would go up. He had called his constituency and was told that he had been duped by the media, and in fact the tax rate would go down. He said to my office that he had been duped into voting Conservative in the last election, but as a consequence of this lie, he had been un-duped and would subsequently no longer be voting Conservative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13262"> Real Canadians do not care whether tax rates are legislated or done by ways and means or orders in council. This is Ottawa talk. What people care about is the taxes they actually pay. As sure as day is day and night is night, if we look at our tax form, if we read the budget, it is abundantly a fact that Canadians will pay a 15% tax rate at the lowest rate in 2005 and 15.5% next year. There is absolutely no doubt about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13263">Will the parliamentary secretary, at least in the interest of transparency, honesty and accountability, acknowledge this basic fact?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="13264">Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to say that under this budget every single Canadian will have lower taxes. In fact, the budget delivers twice the tax relief even if the Liberals had kept their promise, which they rarely were able to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13265">What the member likes to do is torque one little piece of our package and make some assumptions on that instead of doing the honest thing, the true thing, and looking at all the measures taken together. All these measures taken together leave working class Canadians far better off, and they know it. In fact, the budget delivers $20 million in tax relief over just two years back into the hands of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13266">The member likes to twist numbers and talk about them in isolation. He knows, and Canadians know, which is even more important, that middle and lower class income Canadians are better off under this plan because it contains real tax relief and a number of other measures instead of being robbed for wasted projects by the Liberals. We are going to be fiscally responsible in a way that provides real tax relief to all Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="13267">Mr. Speaker, the Tory budget seems long on corporate tax cuts, and I count three or four specific items, but short on corporate tax fairness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13268">In the first Tory budget, why did the Conservatives not do something about what is called, in the language of accountants, tax-motivated expatriation? This is a nice way of putting what are considered to be sleazy, tax-cheating loopholes where corporate tax fugitives create dummy companies in corporate tax havens so they do not have to pay their corporate taxes in Canada. The most egregious example about which most Canadians know is our former prime minister. He very conveniently tore up all the tax treaties with all the other tax havens except for the one country where he himself had all the dummy companies of Canada Steamship Lines so he could be a corporate tax fugitive and avoid paying his fair share of corporate taxes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13269">Why did the Conservatives choose not to plug this last corporate tax haven, which is being exploited? My figures are that it is costing Canadians $15 billion worth of lost revenue?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="13270">Mr. Speaker, I will set aside the temptation to talk about the former prime minister, but I will say it is important for us to remember that both small and large corporations in this country are the engines of wealth creation and they are job creators. It is important that they have a fair tax regime in order that they continue their work to build the Canadian economy and provide a higher standard of living and prosperity for our country. We want to make sure that is done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13271"> We want to make sure that our tax regime is fair for the companies doing business in Canada because there is a huge incentive for them to move elsewhere. Capital is now international and we have to balance the need for fair taxation in our country with the need to attract investment and attract job-creating activity, wealth-creating activity. We try to strike the right balance.</ParaText>

I think that is a very important and fruitful discussion, but balance is important. That is what we strive to deliver and I believe this budget goes a long way toward doing that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="13273">Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary secretary mentioned the tax reductions in the budget as being larger tax cuts than what were in the last two budgets of the Liberal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13274">She failed to mention that in 2000 the Liberal government introduced and implemented the largest tax cut in Canadian history of $100 billion. That was focused at income tax reductions which every serious economist in this country has said is the way that we should proceed, that if we are going to reduce taxes, we should reduce income taxes. The Conservative government has decided to reduce the GST because it is politically expedient. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13275">The member also failed to acknowledge the economic performance under the Liberal government. She was not very gracious in her remarks about that. I wonder if she would reflect upon that and recall that during our Liberal government tenure we had consistent economic growth of 3% per year. We introduced and implemented the largest tax cut in Canadian history. We paid down $55 billion in debt. We eliminated a $42 billion deficit. The economy produced the lowest level of unemployment in Canada's history in the last 40 or 50 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13276">I am wondering if the member has forgotten those particular elements because we hear often about the last 12 or 13 years of the Liberal mandate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13277">Maybe the member could acknowledge those in her remarks when she replies, but if she does not, I wonder if she would comment on the two year horizon that the government is working on in terms of its fiscal plan. Is that because the Conservatives do not really want to outline for Canadians what their plan is beyond that? Certainly the press and very good analysts are speculating that another $20 billion in cuts are coming from the government. I am wondering where those cuts are going to come from and is that the reason the current government is on a two year horizon instead of a five year planning horizon?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="13278">Mr. Speaker, I would advise Canadians to be extremely wary of opposition speculation. It is seldom either accurate or fair. The opposition has an agenda to scare Canadians. We have seen this over and over, especially during the election, and usually not based on a shred of truth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13279">The two year planning horizon is because Canadians are tired of promises down the road, that five years from now they are going to really get something, but hardly any of it happens now. Canadians want to know that if the government promises something, it will be now and they can count on it, that it is going to be this year, that it is going to be in the next few months. That is reasonable. The Liberal promises are made for half a decade down the road, but anything can happen; there are all kinds of variables. If the promises are made and kept now, quickly, then Canadians know they can take them to the bank. That is important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13280">The member bragged about the fiscal record of his government. I would be very careful if I were the member. Under the Liberal government spending increased 15% a year. In the last year how many Canadians had a 15% increase in their incomes so they could fund that kind of spending increase by the Liberals? If the spending increase had given them something useful in some respects, that might have been a different thing, but what did the public see? They saw money squandered and wasted for cronyism, pork-barrelling and corrupt practices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13281">When Canadians see that government is not managed in a fiscally sound way using their money overall, they get concerned. They are not willing to send money to Ottawa to be wasted, squandered and mismanaged in schemes that are not fair to all Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13282">The member has a lot to answer for as part of a government that really destroyed Canadians' trust in many ways in the operations of government. That is why the Conservatives are keeping their promises now. We are keeping them in a short timeframe. We are putting into place good fiscal management, sound fiscal practices and more transparency and accountability so that taxpayers can actually see that their money is being properly used. I would ask the member opposite to applaud that because it is right for Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="13283">Mr. Speaker, as the remarks of the parliamentary secretary made abundantly clear, this is a dishonest budget. It is a visionless budget. It is a mean-spirited budget that tries in a blatant way, and it will be unsuccessful, to play to the Conservative political base.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13284">I think few things are more important than basic honesty. As a constituent from Brandon—Souris discovered on budget day, the budget contains a lie. It says that his income tax rate will go down when in fact it will go up. Whatever the dollar amounts involved, that is irrelevant compared to the basic honesty of a budget document and speech which is entirely lacking from the basic point that it said the tax is going down when the tax is going up. Nothing else matters except for the budget which does not tell the truth. There are other ways in which this is a dishonest budget. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13285">The Indian affairs minister stands in question period in his sanctimonious way and defends his funding to aboriginals when a finance official said only in the last couple of days that the government will have five billion additional dollars, approximately, as a consequence of its reneging on the Kelowna accord. The Conservatives did it. It is confirmed by the officials and they do not admit it. That is dishonest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13286">They have reneged on the Canada-Ontario agreement. They have reneged on the EnerGuide program, which is a highly efficient program and which really hit one low income individual who had already committed to $3,000 and the government is not following through.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13287">In terms of the point my colleague made, it is disingenuous of this budget to ignore the $100 billion tax cuts delivered in 2000. The Conservatives say that the Liberal government would not deliver over a period of five years. Every penny of that $100 billion has been delivered to Canadians in lower tax cuts. That is a fact. Check the budget documents. Therefore, it is wrong to say that the Conservative government has given more tax relief than the Liberals did. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13288">If the numbers are calculated correctly, one will find that in the years since the government balanced its budget in 1997, the Liberal government tax relief amounted to $16 billion per year as opposed to this budget's $6 billion per year. Those are facts. The $16 billion has been delivered. It is not a fiction and so I think the Conservative government is once again being disingenuous with this dishonest budget. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13289">The Conservatives are breaking promises. Many Canadians were looking forward to capital gains relief. Nowhere is that to be seen in this budget.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="13298">In this case the member for Markham--Unionville has been careful to avoid calling the minister dishonest or suggesting that somehow the minister had lied. It appeared that the budget was the thing that to him was offensive. That is the test in my view. Documents can be incorrect. Budgets include more than a speech in the House. Budgets include quite a lot of material that is published with them and tabled with them. The hon. member is helping me out by waving the book in his hand. Yes, those are budget documents and there may be things that are not accurate in them or things which in the hon. member's view are dishonest.

              <ParaText id="13300">Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for confirming my view that the budget is not an hon. member, dishonest though it may be, though it is in fact. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13301">I will move on now to the second theme, that the budget has no vision. It is a dishonest budget without any vision. When the parliamentary secretary says that the budget creates an environment for growth in a competitive tax system, that is a total joke.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="13302">A responsible budget must answer the following question: how can a country of 30 million people compete with the world's giants like China and India? This budget says nothing about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13303">In the area of taxes, this budget does the opposite of what should be done. In all other areas the budget does absolutely nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13304">As far as taxes are concerned, the only difference between this budget and our plan is that income tax will go up so that the GST can go down. Every economist in this country, except perhaps the Prime Minister, agrees that increasing income taxes and reducing consumption taxes is the worst policy in the world. If we want to have a productive economy, full growth, savings and investments, if we want to be competitive in the world, this is the worst thing we could do, period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13305">This issue has another dimension. In reality, Canada will not be able to compete with China's and India's low salaries. That is not our vision. That is not what we want. What we need is our brains, research, innovation and new ideas. The budget provides nothing for this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13306">This budget is nothing but an insult to students in post-secondary education and to those working in research and innovation. While the Liberals allocated $2.5 billion to research and development over five years, this budget allocates only $250 million. It is an insult. It is nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13307">The insult is worse yet for students pursuing post-secondary studies. This is what we would have done: grant $6,000 to each student taking post-secondary education over the span of their four years at university or college. What is this government doing? It is giving a tax break on text books needed for university studies to the tune of $80 a year. We are talking about $6,000 compared to $80. That is the difference in how much this government and the Liberals value students and their parents who work hard to pay for tuition fees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13308">There is nothing in this budget to support the Canadian economy, which is facing intense competition with the world's new giants.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="13309">The third point is that this is a meanspirited budget. It plays to the political base of the Conservative Party. I believe it will fail. It is a crass attempt to take money from people who are unlikely to vote for the Conservatives and put money into the pockets of those whom they hope will vote Conservative. It is as simple as that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13310">For example, can members in the House please tell me why it is only the lowest income tax rate that was increased? This is the only way to hit those who earn $35,000 or less and it is the lower incomes that were hit by the tax hike because they are less likely to vote Conservative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13311">Can members tell me why it is only sports playing families as opposed to music loving families that get the tax break? I suppose the sports playing families are more likely to vote Conservative, but even they will not be very happy when they find out that their $500 tax credit is not worth $500; it is worth more like $80.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13312">The social engineering by the Conservative Party favoured activities like sports, which get money, yet unfavoured activities like music do not, let alone the person who has a difficult time even affording to buy a basketball.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13313">Why do the aboriginals get shafted? Why is their $5 billion taken away? I suppose it is because they are not likely to vote Conservative. Better to put the money into the pockets of the Conservative base.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13314">Why do the Conservatives take away money from the supplement to the child tax credit? The lowest income, mothers of young children, get much less of the $1,200 because the supplement is clawed back. Again, they are not likely to vote Conservative, are they?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13315">Why, apart from the fact that the finance minister wants to put homeless people in jail, does the budget talk about cutting off their funding? I suppose, apart from the government and the minister thinking they should be in jail, the homeless will probably not vote Conservative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13316">Why does the government skate close to the edge on returning to deficit? It takes away the prudence, that cushion, to protect us from going into deficit. It is less kind to future generations, the ones who benefit from the debt paydown. Any responsible economist knows that in a time of an aging population, it is even more important than normal to pay down the debt. Why do the Conservatives not care about future generations? It is simple. Future generations will not vote in the next election. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13317">The Conservatives do not care about the environment. Why do they slash and burn expenditures on the environment? Everything except the special measures with direct benefit to the brother of the Minister of Finance. That one gets money, but everything else is slashed. I supposed the environment will not vote in the next election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13318">This is a dishonest budget. It does not tell the truth, the black and white truth about what is happening to income tax rates. It is a visionless budget. It does nothing for the future of this country. It is a meanspirited budget. It takes money out of the pockets of the least privileged, simply because they are unlikely to vote Conservative, and put the money into the pockets of the Conservative base.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13319">My last point is that it will not work. It will not work because Canadians, like that gentleman from Brandon--Souris, are intelligent. The government underestimates their intelligence. Canadians will know when they get their pay stub in July that their income tax rates have gone up. They will not believe this dishonest budget because they will see it in black and white on their pay slips.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13320">This dishonest budget will not resonate with Canadians. Indeed, polling shows that two-thirds of Canadians question the motives of the budget. Two-thirds of Canadians already believe that the budget is designed to get a majority, and not designed to be good for Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13321">I believe that Canadians will react negatively to this dishonest budget. Canadians will react negatively to a fiscally irresponsible and socially destructive budget that contains no vision for our future and that risks returning into deficit.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="13323">Canadians have a basic sense of fairness, decency, and a desire for vision for this country.

All the member opposite for Markham—Unionville did is attack motives with black helicopter conspiracies about why we put forward this budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13325">The fact is that this budget will help Canadians. It is good for the economy and it is good for every region of the country. The government is lowering taxes for every Canadian in every income group through lower sales taxes and a lower income tax that is going from 16% to 15.5%. Net taxes for every single Canadian will be lowered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13326">The member is right in one sense, Conservatives are pushing forward this budget to speak to our base. Our base is the entire country and the Canadian people. The polls show that the country is responding well to this budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13327">This is one thing that I found very interesting. Since January 23, when we have been on this side of the House and the Liberals are now on that side of the House, perhaps for hopefully a very long time, the Liberals all of a sudden have all these great ideas. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13328">We have noticed in question period and in their speeches, such as the one we just heard, that the Liberals say that they promised to do this and the Conservatives are doing that. It does not matter what a Liberal promise is, it matters what gets delivered. The Conservative government is delivering to Canadians.</ParaText>

This is good for Canada's economy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="13340">I think the Conservative government has simply taken a page out of the Liberal government's record on how to write a budget. The Liberal government has never presented a budget that was any more friendly for the vulnerable in our community. I am thinking about the hard-working seniors in my community. They have worked hard all their lives. They have done everything right and yet they are finding it harder and harder to make ends meet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13341">There is nothing in the budget for seniors in any of our communities. Yes, the government talks about some income tax credit that will benefit very few seniors in my community of Hamilton Mountain. Where is the real increase to public pension benefits? Where is the increase to CPP? Where is the long awaited increase to the OAS and the GIS? Those are things for which seniors have been clamouring for years. They did not get them under the Liberals. It is another missed opportunity under the Conservative government as well.</ParaText>

But it is still not $1,200, it is still not child care, and it is not universal, not even close.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13400">The government is still taxing the benefit and eliminating the $249 young child supplement. Working families will see very little at the end of the day, not as much as a lot of wealthy Canadians, according to the latest from the Caledon Institute.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13401">In fact, single working parents will get the least. They may see about $500 or $600. These people need child care the most. They need to earn a living to feed their families, but wealthy stay at home spouses of high income earners will see the highest benefit of all at $971. They need child care the least, but will see the most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13402"> This is not a universal benefit. It is a universal con game and a cruel joke for working families and single parents.</ParaText>

The maximum penalty for this crime would increase from five years to 10 years imprisonment.

              <ParaText id="13618">Mr. Speaker, with regard to Correctional Services Canada, CSC, for the purpose of responding to part a) of the member’s question, CSC has provided statistics on those federal offenders that have been convicted of murder or at least one Schedule 1 offence.  For a complete list of Schedule 1 offences, please refer to the Corrections and Conditional Release Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13619">Of the 12,661 federally incarcerated offenders, 756 are serving a sentence for a 1st degree murder offence<Sup>1</Sup> , 1,661 are serving a sentence for a 2nd degree murder offence<Sup>2</Sup>, and 7,229 are serving a sentence for a Schedule I<Sup>3</Sup>  offence.  Total equals 9,646.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13620">Of the 8,340 federal offenders in the community, 168 are serving a sentence for a 1st degree murder offence, 1,415 are serving a sentence for a 2nd degree murder offence, and 3,554 are serving a sentence for a Schedule I offence.  Total equals 5,137. The data is as of March 26, 2006.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13621">With regard to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, RCMP, the Canadian Criminal Records Information Services, CCRIS, and the Canadian Police Information Centre, CPIC, contain criminal justice information entered by police agencies and some government agencies such as the Canada Border Services Agency and Correctional Services Canada.  Although able to enter appropriate information, no agency is legally obligated to do so except in the case of Youth Criminal Justice.  For this reason, the statistical information provided about data in CCRIS and CPIC repositories is not reflective of overall Canadian statistics.   The RCMP was able to answer sub-questions b), c), d) and e):</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13622">b) 	The RCMP can only provide information on the number of records within CPIC where persons are prohibited from possessing a firearm, not the number of people prohibited from owning a firearm.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13623">The number of records entered on CPIC for “prohibited from possessing firearms” is 201,097.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13624">It should be noted that a person could be prohibited more than once or in more than one province and each prohibition will be captured as a separate record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13625">c) 	The CPIC system is designed in a way to capture all warrants. The system was not designed to differentiate between a criminal arrest warrant, for serious offences and a warrant for arrest, for such offences as non-payment of fines.  As such, to provide this information, a manual search in the system would have to take place which would represent a major undertaking that would not fall within the limited time of response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13626">d) 	The RCMP is unable to provide this information as CPIC does not maintain this kind of statistical information.  The CPIC system was not devised as a statistics tool, but rather a police investigative tool.  As such, each police service would have to be contacted to verify if a specific individual is released with or without conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13627">e) 	There are 161,916 records on CPIC for probation category with recognizance orders.  These orders include peace bonds (not of a criminal nature), recognizance and restraining orders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13628">With regard to the Canada Firearms Centre, CAFC, the center is able to answer sub-questions f) and g) only:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13629">f)	As of March 31, 2006, there have been 6,311 licence applications refused, and 10,915 licences revoked.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="78639" Type="2" Desc="">Mr. Mario Laframboise (Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="13653">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise on behalf of the Bloc Québécois to speak to Bill C-13, the budget implementation bill for 2006.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13654">It is never easy for those who follow our proceedings. This week, we voted on the budget. Once it is adopted, we have to be able to implement it. Implementing certain parts of the budget often requires legislative amendments to other acts of Parliament. That is more or less what is being proposed in Bill C-13. Again, and I will explain this during my speech, it does not authorize spending in all areas. The amendments contained in this bill are necessary to implement the budget. I will explain that because it is sometimes a bit complicated to follow this legislative debate and other parliamentary proceedings. I believe that if we take the time to look at this bill closely, its objectives will become obvious. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13655">The budget proposed a reduction in the GST. Part 1 of the budget implementation bill amends the Excise Tax Act so that the GST can be reduced from 7% to 6% as of July 1, 2006. Once we have adopted this bill, people will know that, as of July 1, 2006, the GST will be reduced by 1 percentage point, from 7% to 6%. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13656">This reduction requires amendments to various acts, including the Excise Act, 2001 and the Excise Act, which makes all this a little complicated. But the main objective of part 1 of this bill is to reduce the GST by 1 percentage point as of July 1. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13657">Part 2 deals with changes to income taxes. The budget included several tax-related announcements. Part 2 of Bill C-13, which we are discussing today, amends the Income Tax Act to implement the various announcements made in the budget. I will give all the provisions of the Income Tax Act that will be amended, and I will not read the section numbers, in order to simplify matters for the people who are watching.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13658">First, the personal tax rate will be reduced by .5%. More specifically, the rate will be reduced by .25% in 2006 and .5% in 2007. The basic personal amount will increase: it will be $8,648 in 2005, $8,839 in 2006 and $8,639 in 2007.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13659">The basic personal amount for common-law partners and spouses will also increase, allowing every Canadian to buy an additional coffee each week. That is the conclusion a number of analysts have reached. That is the decision the government made. I do have to mention, though, that there will be a reduction in income tax, amounting to $2 a week at most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13660">Bill C-13, which we are discussing today, will increase the child disability benefit to $2,300 effective July 1, 2006.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13661">The refundable medical expense supplement will be increased to $1,000. Capital gains on donations of publicly listed securities and ecologically sensitive land will be eliminated. The mineral exploration tax credit will be reinstated. The eligibility criteria for the disability tax credit will be modified. The lists of expenses eligible for the disability supports deduction and the medical expenses tax credit will be expanded. The amount of home renovation and construction expenses for disabled persons or others who need assistance that caregivers can claim will be doubled.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13662">A tax credit for adoption expenses will be offered. There will be tax deferrals for shareholders of agricultural co-ops. There will be corporate tax cuts. The corporate tax rate will be reduced from 21% to 19% by 2010. The capital tax will be eliminated on December 31, 2007.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13663">Lastly, the carry-over period for non-capital losses and investment tax credits will be extended.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="10">(1210)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="13664">This second part deals with the changes to the Income Tax Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13665">It must be understood--and I say this primarily for the benefit of our citizens who are listening--that when the time comes to discuss or to vote on a budget, the government proposes a number of topics. People need to understand that, when it comes to our support of the government's budget, the Bloc Québécois remains faithful to the principles that brought it here to this House, namely, to defend the interests of Quebeckers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13666">Clearly, the Bloc Québécois' primary objective continues to be resolving the fiscal imbalance. In a moment, I will cite a few figures that were music to the ears of the Liberal Party of Quebec, but that are far from the cure-all. Yet, at least this government decided to acknowledge the fiscal imbalance. When it was tabled, the budget was accompanied by a 135-page document on achieving a fiscal balance between the provinces and the federal government. The concept of the fiscal imbalance is rather simple: Ottawa has too much money, which generates a large surplus in relation to the amounts available to the provinces. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13667">We must always bear in mind that the federal government does not look after our everyday concerns. It is important to understand that. The federal government does not look after the everyday concerns of men and women in Quebec and Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13668">Health, for example, is an area of provincial jurisdiction, as is education. We want to ensure that our families, our children, our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren have the education necessary to do what needs to be done to advance the economy. That comes under provincial jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13669">Highway maintenance also comes under that jurisdiction, as do water and sewer systems, waste collection and all sorts of areas affecting our everyday life. Tap water is an area of provincial jurisdiction, because municipalities come under provincial jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13670">Resolving the fiscal imbalance is among the Bloc Québécois' objectives. Therefore, the Conservative government's stated intention to resolve it within a specific timeframe will do for this year. But, in the 2007 budget, the government will have to clearly state that it is committed to resolving the fiscal imbalance. That was one of our reasons for supporting this budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13671">In addition, the government pledged to look into the whole issue of older workers. We will recall the mass closures of manufacturing companies for various reasons, including globalization and emerging economies such as India and China, which are competing with us a lot. In many cases, the employees of these manufacturing companies had been working for 10, 15, 20 or 25 years, without necessarily approaching retirement. As a result, their age—they are often over 50—makes it difficult for them to find new jobs in other companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13672">We want an older workers assistance program like the POWA to be put in place. The government promised to put one in place. Granted, no funds were earmarked for that in this budget. But the government made a firm commitment to look into and measure the costs of a program to assist older workers. We know that there is enough money in the EI fund, which employees and employer pay into, to establish such a program. A seed was sown in budget 2006; let us hope that, over the course of 2007, the federal government will successfully deal with the older workers issue and, with its next budget, resolve the fiscal imbalance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13673">Bill C-13, which has been tabled in the House today, represents the implementation of certain provisions of the budget, including those requiring amendments to certain acts. I gave the example of part 2, which deals with amendments to the Income Tax Act. Part 3 amends the Excise Tax Act by repealing the excise tax on jewellery, clocks and items made from semi-precious stones, effective May 2, 2006. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13674">This budget contains a multitude of small provisions and, let us not forget, has returned $14 billion to taxpayers. All these small measures represent a few dollars per week, just enough to pay for a coffee I must admit. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="15">(1215)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="13675"> The measures in a number of clauses are applicable to certain portions of industries or businesses. For example, part 3 repeals the excise tax on jewellery under the Excise Tax Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13676">Part 4 amends the First Nations Goods and Services Tax Act. Once again, this will facilitate the establishment of tax arrangements between the governments of specified provinces and interested Indian bands situated in those provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13677">Among other things, it will also give a certain governmental autonomy to Yukon first nations resulting in better fiscal arrangements between the first nations and the provincial governments in terms of payment of taxes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13678">Part 5 contains another amendment affecting taxation under the Excise Tax Act, Excise Act, 2001, the Air Travellers Security Charge Act, and the Income Tax Act, in order to harmonize various accounting, interest, penalty and related application and enforcement provisions. Again , this is to facilitate the application of a portion of the budget in legislation affecting very specific parts of certain industries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13679"> Part 6, to which the Bloc Québécois made a significant contribution, deals of course with the universal child care benefit, this $1,200 amount that will be paid to families as of July 1, 2006 for each child under six years of age. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13680">Members will recall the questions that the Bloc Québécois put to the government when it announced this benefit because it was going to be taxable and it could have an impact on other benefits such as EI benefits and children's special allowances. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13681">Even though the government maintained its decision to make the universal child care benefit taxable, it is amending the Income Tax Act, the Employment Insurance Act and the Children's Special Allowances Act so that this $1,200 a year benefit does not affect the other benefits covered by these acts. In other words, this will ensure that adding $1,200 to the lowest income in the family will not cause a reduction in EI benefits or in children's special allowances. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13682">Again, we can call this a victory for the Bloc Québécois. We would have liked for the benefit not to be taxable, but it is never easy with the Conservative Party. These people are slow to understand. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13683">We hope that, next year, when those who will be receiving the $100 a month or $1,200 a year benefit get a T4 from the federal government, the government will understand that it should have listened to the Bloc Québécois and not given us only half of what we were calling for, which was a non-taxable benefit for families. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13684">As I just explained, part 6 that relates to the universal child care benefit deals with the implementation of this measure. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13685">Part 7 of Bill C-13 deals with the federal-provincial fiscal arrangements and makes some changes to the equalization formula. The Bloc Québécois has been consistently asking that certain parameters not be taken into account in the equalization formula. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13686">An adjustment was made giving Quebec $5.539 billion in fiscal equalization payments this year, an increase of $185 million over the old formula. Again, for the Bloc Québécois, balancing equalization payments is part of correcting the fiscal imbalance. Quebec has thus gained $185 million. However, the Premier of Quebec, Mr. Charest, who still tends to give in to whatever the Conservatives want, was close to a historic agreement on equalization payments. We are far from it. I hope that Mr. Charest, in all his wisdom, will understand that with respect to correcting the fiscal imbalance, Quebec has a right to expect much more than the $185 million it will get this year. Even though the Conservative Party seems at least to have recognized that the Liberals' calculation of equalization payments was wrong, $185 million this year is not a whole lot. We hope that as it drafts its 2007 budget, the government will truly understand that correcting the fiscal imbalance means correcting the equalization formula.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="13687">It has to stop calculating—or not calculating—as part of provincial revenues, all the duties on natural resources that give some provinces certain advantages over others. It has to understand that Quebec has paid. Quebeckers, our fathers and grandfathers alone have paid for setting up the entire hydroelectricity concept in Quebec. Let that be understood. Since 1970, the federal government has invested $66 billion in developing fossil fuels. Just look at the Athabasca oil sands, the Hibernia project and other carbon-based development projects—or even nuclear energy—in which the federal government has invested, when it has not invested a dime in hydroelectricity development in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13688">You will understand that it is very difficult, in calculating equalization, not to take into account the revenues other Canadian provinces get from their natural resources. Once again, it is an aberration of the Canadian federation. In that respect, this would not be the first time Quebeckers are treated unfairly by the federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13689">Thus, part 7 allows changes to existing legislation to redefine equalization for 2006-07. This will provide a certain advantage. Once again, this is one of the reasons that motivated the Bloc Québécois to support the budget. Quebec would nonetheless benefit from an extra $185 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13690">Part 8 talks about payments to the provinces and territories. We must remember that an agreement was signed between the Government of Canada—then led by the Liberal party—and the provinces on the whole child care network matter, which was called the early learning and child care network. It is a child care program. Hon. members will recall that agreements were signed. This case is not closed. As far as I know, the Government of Quebec, Mr. Charest, has not buckled to the federal government. It still wants this agreement signed by the former government to be upheld.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13691">This year Quebec will receive $152 million to help it continue to establish its provincial $7 a day child care network. It is a longstanding request. This great project was skilfully piloted by the Parti Québécois. That said, Quebec's child care network is now an example the world over. People come to Quebec to see how we came up with this. Other Canadian provinces seem to want to have the same service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13692">Because we live in a time where work-family balance is important, families need to be able to have their children cared for in a network of child care centres with qualified staff. The men and women who work in the child care centres in Quebec are qualified. They are paid fairly for the work they do. They provide children with some measure of education and enable their parents to work. This is more or less the principle on which the Parti Québécois based the world's best network of child care centres. We in Quebec take pride in that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13693">Obviously, we are proud that the federal government is taking part in that program this year and honoured its commitment by signing the agreement with the Government of Quebec. The problem is that the Conservative government has decided to terminate that program in 2007.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13694">Clearly, the Bloc Québécois will vote on the budget provisions one by one, year by year. We will not necessarily support the federal government's budget next year just because we support its budget this year. We will see; we will consider each budget on its own merits. Bloc Québécois members have always acted reasonably and responsibly. That is the way we do things, and that is how we succeeded in being elected again in 51 out of 75 ridings in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13695">Quebeckers place their trust in the Bloc Québécois because of its unique, responsible way of defending their interests. I hold the deep conviction that regardless of what is said or discussed and even what the polls say, when a future election is held, large numbers of Quebeckers will once again entrust responsibility for federal policy to real Quebeckers who defend their interests. And only the Bloc Québécois members do this.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="13700">By supporting the budget, the Bloc decided to support the $1,200. What we asked was that this amount be non-taxable, which the Conservative government refused. The Bloc's message to the Conservative government is that it was the one that decided to give the $1,200 per child per year to families with children under six. The federal government and the provinces signed an agreement to establish a national child care network, although Quebec is already ahead of such a network. Continue to pay and to respect that agreement. If the government wants to give $1,200 to all such mothers, well hooray for Mother's Day. Everyone will be delighted. However, the Quebec government must continue to receive the available and necessary money so that a network can be established while keeping the fee at $7. The federal government's actions must not force the Quebec government to increase its day care fees to $25 a day. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="13701">Mr. Speaker, the member presented a very good outline of the various acts and provisions and how the budget implementation act will work. I thank him especially for mentioning jewellery and microbreweries which will help the Yukon. He also made wonderful comments on how many of the provisions that the public sees as being so great will amount to about a cup of coffee. This happens many times when people analyze a budget. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13702">However, I think the member went overboard when he said that the Bloc is defending the interests of Quebec. Last June when his party voted against Bill C-48, the Bloc voted against public transit, affordable housing, training, post-secondary education, and foreign aid. Quebeckers believe in all those things and the Bloc betrayed them. He said that people are being too complimentary and are bending to the Conservatives. The Bloc itself is doing that by supporting the budget on the backs of the most vulnerable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13703">Quebeckers do not believe in doing this on the backs of students. Quebeckers do not believe in increasing income tax rates for the poor, in abolishing Kelowna, in abolishing Kyoto. How could the Bloc members possibly vote for this budget? They have given two reasons, one being older workers. We all agree with that. A study has already been done and a pilot project is working. Yet we get weak answers from the minister that the pilot project has to be studied again. The Bloc got nothing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13704">On the fiscal imbalance, the member said in his speech that Quebec received $155 million in increased equalization. My riding of Yukon received none. His province lost three times more than that on day care. It lost hundreds of millions of dollars on day care and received a promise from the government that it would study the fiscal imbalance. Is taking money away from Quebec going to solve what the Bloc believes is the fiscal imbalance?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13705">Could the member tell me why the Bloc supported the budget?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="13706">Mr. Speaker, I cannot get over my Liberal colleague criticizing me for wanting to resolve the problem of older workers, given that the Liberals did not do a thing in 13 years to deal with the EI problem. I have a great deal of difficulty understanding where my Liberal colleague is coming from.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13707">He, however, will understand why the logic of the Bloc Québécois always remained the same. The Bloc is asking that the fiscal imbalance be resolved. As I said earlier, the federal government does not deal with any of the real everyday problems people are facing. Health, education, drinking water, garbage, transportation and highways are all areas of provincial responsibility. That is why the Bloc's main objective never changed: to take the surpluses in Ottawa and give them to the provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13708">The problem is that the Liberal Party never acknowledged that there was too much money in Ottawa and not enough in the provinces. At least, the Conservative Party appears to be willing to recognize that fact. We are giving it a chance. The Conservative Party has set a 2007 deadline for showing what it will do. In the interest of Quebeckers, the Bloc is prepared to wait until 2007. But the problem better be resolved, though.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="13709">Mr. Speaker, my view is that the Bloc Québécois made a really bad deal. I honestly believe, and I say this with all due respect, there was more on the table that it could have used its bargaining power to achieve. This is a missed opportunity not just for the Bloc but for all of us, because in this minority Parliament the three opposition parties have all the power. We have the bargaining leverage, but it was given away. All negotiations stopped the very moment the leader of the Bloc Québécois walked out of this room and, in front of the microphone and the cameras, said, “I support that budget”. Negotiations ended. Kyoto, good-bye.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13710">We could have forced the Tories to accept Kyoto had the Bloc only held its ground and stayed tough. It did not for some reason. It is beyond me. I cannot see the benefit. At least when the NDP traded our support to prop up the Liberal Party, we held our noses and supported the Liberal Party but we traded it for $4.8 billion worth of spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13711">Some people argue that the Liberals did not follow through with their promise, but in fact the Tories are fulfilling the promise the Liberals made by putting that money in trust to fulfill Bill C-48. We got something for our vote. The Bloc got nothing for its vote. It is like the <I>Jack and the Beanstalk</I> story, where we trade the family cow for three beans, none of which sprout.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13712"> I have a great deal of respect for my friend and colleague from the Bloc. Will he tell me, though, what did the Bloc get for this to sell out so early and to sell out on all of his opposition colleagues?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="13713">Mr. Speaker, I have been attempting for a while to explain to my colleagues that the real problem with the entire federation is the large amount of money in Ottawa and the small amount in the provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13714">One day, they will understand that the fight led by the Bloc Québécois for Quebeckers is, at the same time, a fight for all Canadians, who see, when they use their roads, drink water from the tap, have household garbage problems and health and education issues, that the root of these problems is that there is too much money in Ottawa and not enough in the provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13715">That is what we are trying to do and, for the first time, we have a government that seems to be interested in resolving this imbalance. Thus, we are giving it a chance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13716">As for the rest, I would say to my NDP colleague, that this budget has done more for workers than the NDP has been able to do. Although it supported the Liberal budget , the NDP obtained nothing for workers. However, we have obtained a commitment from the government to analyze and solve the issue of older workers. I am speaking of all those individuals who, because of globalization and emerging markets, are losing their jobs after 15, 20 or 25 years of service and cannot find other work because they are over 50 and are having trouble. It will be a Bloc Québécois victory when an announcement is made in this regard. I hope he will applaud at that time.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="13717">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to participate in the debate on Bill C-13, the government's bill to implement the budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13718">I had been cautiously optimistic that both this bill and the budget before it might have contained some good news for my community of Hamilton Mountain and, indeed, for all working families across Canada. After all, with this government's fiscal capacity, this budget was a huge opportunity to invest. From its own books, we know that the Conservative government has an $8 billion surplus this year and $83 billion in surplus money over the next five years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13719">There has never been a better opportunity to invest in child care, education, training, and the environment, yet the government chose instead to squander over $7 billion of that $8 billion on tax cuts and subsidies to oil and gas companies. It is no wonder that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13720"> My colleague from Winnipeg North, who is also our party's finance critic, released information yesterday which clearly indicates that while the rich are getting richer, most Canadian families have seen their real incomes shrink since 1989. The fact is that the average income for the majority of Canadians, before taxes and transfers, is lower today than it was in 1980. Most Canadian families are poorer, and the recent federal budget will not be helpful in fighting this family income crisis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13721">The Conference Board of Canada reports that while the average CEO experienced record growth in total compensation, at about 20% a year, most Canadians are working longer and harder for less pay and a smaller piece of the pie. It is simplistic, naive and even manipulative of the federal government to tell people that tax cuts will fix the problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13722">What Canadians want and deserve is an investment in the things that matter most. Unfortunately, in that regard this budget is a missed opportunity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13723">The only real investment is a re-announcement by the government of the money that the NDP budget delivered for working families in the last Parliament. We secured $1.6 billion for housing. The Conservatives re-announced that spending by allocating $800 million to affordable housing, $300 million to northern housing and $300 million to off reserve aboriginal housing. Even at that, they are still $200 million short of investing the full amount of the $1.6 billion that the NDP budget delivered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13724">Similarly, the NDP secured $900 million for public transit and energy retrofit programs and another $400 million under Bill C-66. That totalled $1.3 billion, the exact amount the Conservatives re-announced in their budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13725">In yet another re-announcement of NDP money, the government reduced the $1.5 billion commitment to post-secondary education from the NDP budget by 33% to just $1 billion. Even worse, instead of letting that money go to tuition fee reductions, to which it was originally assigned, the Conservatives have redirected the money solely to bricks and mortar instead. Investments in infrastructure will do nothing to protect Canadian students from skyrocketing debts and surely will not ease the barrier to education that rising costs represent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13726">When it comes to foreign aid, the government has also failed both Canadians and the international community. The Conservatives' budget simply re-announced investments made in the NDP budget. Even at that, it reduced our country's contribution from the $500 million the NDP had secured last year to a mere $332 million. We are falling further and further behind in honouring the millennium development goal and meeting our commitment of committing 0.7% of GDP to foreign aid.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13727"> Let us be clear about this. Meeting these commitments is not a matter of altruism. It is the most practical response Canada can offer to reduce global economic inequality, the single most important contributor to international instability and insecurity. It is time that Canada stepped up to the plate and lived up to the commitments we made when we supported the more than 50 United Nations resolutions at the General Assembly, as well as other votes, all of which supported the 0.7% target.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13728">In my riding of Hamilton Mountain, more and more people are joining the campaign to make poverty history. I wear a white bracelet as a symbol of solidarity with all others who are committed to helping the world's poorest and most needy people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13729">While I am speaking about our international obligations, let me take just a moment to speak about the crisis in Darfur, which the government fails to address altogether in its recent budget. New Democrats are on the record as urging the government to use Canada's influence to insist that the five permanent members of the UN Security Council respect and support the right to protect.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="13730"> Members of the Security Council, including China, Russia, France and the United States, must put an end to their self-serving delays and their lip service and act now to apply international pressure on the Khartoum regime to end the violence in Darfur by respecting the arms embargo mandated under Security Council resolution 1591. Canada must encourage the UN to consider the deployment of a UN-led peacekeeping force to join the AU in trying to stabilize and improve conditions for the people of Darfur.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13731"> Beyond the UN, there are measures the government can take that will have an immediate impact. The first step must be to increase the funding to the world food program for emergency aid. I am sorry to say that funding for this program was slashed by the Liberal government from $20 million in 2005 to just $5 million in 2006. This can be corrected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13732">Second, Canada must strive to ensure that development is not diverted to the Sudanese government, but rather that it reaches the people in need. This country's record on foreign aid had been one of steady and shameful decline. That is why the NDP ensured the inclusion of half a billion dollars for foreign aid in Bill C-48, our budget amendment of last year, to help those suffering in countries such as Sudan. Those funds are now available and should be used.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13733">Third, Canada must increase its direct aid to the African Union.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13734">Finally, the government can and must take immediate steps to support target sanctions against government leaders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13735">There certainly is no shortage of international need for Canadian leadership. Unfortunately, such leadership thus far has been sadly lacking. In fact, the government has not demonstrated any better leadership in dealing with domestic issues. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13736">As I said earlier, this budget is one of missed opportunities. Let me give members just a few more examples. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13737">Although I have addressed issues of poverty in a global context, allow me to take just a moment to reflect on the increasing poverty at home. In my hometown of Hamilton, one in five people live below the poverty line. Twenty-five per cent of those are children, but we all know that children are not poor. It is their parents who are poor. Hamilton families need help now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13738">We need to invest in our manufacturing sector to ensure that we will continue to have decent paying jobs in our community, yet Bill C-13, the budget implementation bill, is silent on this issue. It offers neither a steel industry strategy nor an auto sector strategy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13739">Nor does Bill C-13 do anything to provide funding for decent paying public sector jobs for professions such as nurses or nurse practitioners, who are so crucial to improving our health care system. Similarly, the doctor shortage remains unaddressed. In fact, as I will return to later, the entire budget is largely silent on one of the top of mind issues for most Canadians, and that is health care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13740">Continuing on the jobs front for the moment, decent paying jobs also are not being supported by adequate training and retraining opportunities in this bill. Without such support, it is impossible to build and maintain the skilled workforce that is essential to supporting the 21st century economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13741">Of course, there is the double-barrelled impact of not supporting our municipalities with money for infrastructure renewal and housing. Not only does this curtail the number of building trade jobs in our communities, but it also adversely impacts the ability of cities like Hamilton to provide residents with the services they deserve. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13742">In short, there is nothing in this bill to offer hope to working families. It is simply a missed opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13743">What about those whose careers are behind them? This budget offers absolutely nothing to our seniors. They have worked hard all their lives, they have played by the rules, and yet they are finding it harder and harder to make ends meet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13744"> Despite a compelling report entitled “Aging and Poverty in Canada”, by the government's own National Advisory Council on Aging, the Conservatives have done nothing to address any of its key recommendations. Instead of offering income tax credits that will do nothing to improve the lives of most Canadian seniors, the government should lift seniors out of poverty by increasing the guaranteed income supplement to at least the low income cut-offs recognized by Statistics Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13745">Instead of proposing to pump $3 billion of taxpayers' money into the CPP for questionable purposes, the government should be using that money to raise the public pension benefits of all seniors. CPP has always been a “pay as you go” plan that does not rely on public money and, by the government's own estimates, CPP is going to be solvent for more than 75 years. It hardly needs a cash infusion. It is seniors who desperately need additional cash, not in the pension fund, but in their pockets.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="13746">With so many private pension funds currently in a state of underfunding, it would have been helpful if the government's only statement on this critical issue had not been to address debt servicing, but rather had focused on benefit security for workers and retirees made vulnerable by the solvency issues surrounding their pension plans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13747">I introduced a bill in the House on Tuesday entitled the workers first bill, which would put workers at the head of the list of creditors in cases of commercial bankruptcies. If the government really wants to do the right thing for seniors, I would encourage the industry minister to work with me so that together we could ensure quick passage of my bill for the protection of workers' wages and benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13748">There is one more pension issue that needs to be addressed immediately, but it is one that only got a promise of review and more study in the government's budget. That is the issue of survivor pensions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13749">At first blush, the budget documents that the minister tabled on May 2 seem to offer a faint promise of hope for parents and grandparents of children with physical, psychological and developmental disabilities. In fact, on page 105 the budget states: </ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">An important consideration for parents and grandparents of a child with severe disabilities is how best to ensure the financial security of their child, when they are no longer able to provide support.

                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13751"> While the minister indicates a timetable for receiving initial input, he offers absolutely no timetable for action. In the midst of a minority government, that is a huge concern. Families are tired of waiting. They want answers now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13752">Moreover, I hope the small group of experts is not limited to actuaries only. This issue goes well beyond exploring options for private pensions and trusts and must include a full examination of all public supports, a new way of dealing with other moneys or assets left to survivors and a prohibition on clawbacks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13753">I look forward to engaging the Minister of Finance in a dialogue on this issue because action is long overdue. Action of course is also long overdue on a number of other issues but again, instead of dealing with these issues head on, Bill C-13 and the budget represent a missed opportunity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13754">Let me turn first to health care. If health care is one of the government's top five priorities, why is it barely mentioned in the budget? If it is so important, where is the plan? Where are the imperatives? How is the federal government going to work with the provinces? Where is that information? It certainly is not in the budget implementation bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13755">As I have said in the House before, people in my riding of Hamilton Mountain remember only too well the last time a Conservative government turned its mind to health care. The last Conservative government in Ontario, of which the current Minister of Finance was then a member, threatened to close the Henderson Hospital, jeopardized access to home care and did nothing to address the unprecedented shortages of family doctors in the community. In fact, it laid the foundation upon which Premier McGuinty is now building his P3 hospitals and justifying the privatization of health care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13756">I had hoped that the Minister of Finance might have learned from his mistakes in Ontario and not repeated them here. However, his budget did nothing to expand public home care, an issue which not only impacts the most vulnerable families in the community but is directly linked to opening up beds in the acute care system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13757">The budget did nothing to reduce wait times for surgeries, which could have been done by investing in training and skills upgrading for health providers, particularly nurses and nurse practitioners. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13758">The budget did nothing to act on the recommendation of the provincial premiers by enacting a national drug plan, which could have saved Canadians $2 billion a year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13759">In short, this budget should have been an opportunity to get serious about implementing the recommendations of the Romanow report so that governments like the McGuinty Liberals in Ontario would have to stop using the federal government as a scapegoat for proceeding with their ideologically based push toward the privatization of health care. However, instead of seizing the opportunity, this budget is just another missed opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13760">The same is true of the environment. The Conservative budget and the budget implementation bill that is before the House today do absolutely nothing to address the profound environmental challenges that confront Canadians today. The silence is absolutely deafening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13761">When it comes to climate change, we have essentially lost yet another year on this most critical issue. It is showing up on the pages of <I>Macleans</I>, on the front page of <I>The New York Times</I> and across our communities, but it is not showing up in the budget. Canadians want this issue addressed. They recognize that the environment and wellness are inextricably linked. They know that environmental issues have a positive impact on our economy, but as of May 2 they also know that the Conservatives do not care.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="13762">Over many decades, and sometimes not deservedly, Canada has earned itself a reputation as a country that engages the international community in a positive way, whether it was through former prime minister Pearson's work in the UN or eventually through such treaties as Kyoto. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13763">The Liberal Party of Canada as early as 1993 made commitments, Liberal promises if you will, to cut greenhouse gas emissions, but once in power the Liberals went about doing absolutely the opposite. In fact, emissions rose by over 25%, a record worse than that of the Bush administration in the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13764">Successive Liberal governments have not made the investments to improve the productivity and efficiency of the Canadian economy and to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that it promised to do. There was a deathbed conversion as the Liberals were starting to sink in the polls and only then did a plan finally come forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13765">As an environmentalist, I can remember day after day the then minister of the environment saying that the Liberals had a plan, that it was coming, to just hang on and have a little patience. It literally took years. The Kyoto accord was signed in 1997 and the government said nothing until 2005. What did Canada end up with: a discussion paper about climate change. There were no targets, no timelines and no strategy whatsoever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13766">Now there is a Conservative government in power, a government that has only recently come to realize what most of the world has known for years, that climate change caused by humans is in fact happening and is in fact a threat to both our society and our economy. Yet the budget is devoid of a strategy for dealing with climate change. It is a budget that is being declared an absolute disaster by environmental groups across the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13767">Instead of offering solutions and a concrete plan, it cut $1 billion from home retrofit programs that benefited both the environment and low income families across our country. When it comes to the environment, there is no more significant tool than the budget to make real progress. The message the government sent through its first budget is that the environment simply does not matter. The budget has failed Canadians both at home and internationally when it comes to the environment and it is yet another missed opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13768">By this time in my participation in this debate, I have already outlined at least eight opportunities for meaningful action that were missed in both the budget and the budget implementation bill. Since the government was intent on cutting taxes rather than making meaningful investments that would help working families, perhaps that should not surprise me. There were two other missed opportunities that I would now like to identify which fall squarely into the tax cutting agenda and yet they too are nowhere to be found.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13769">The first issue I would like to raise is the elimination of the goods and services tax on literacy materials. Yesterday I had the good fortune of seconding the introduction of Bill C-276, an act to amend the Excise Tax Act, literacy materials. The bill was brought forward by my good friend the NDP finance critic and member for Winnipeg North, who shares my belief that literacy is a necessity and must therefore not be subject to taxes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13770"> For many Canadians the added cost of the GST can be a real impediment and there are far too many barriers to literacy already. Removing the GST on books and audiovisual materials for literacy training in fact complements existing tax relief programs given to organizations that conduct literacy work. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13771">In my view, the GST should never have been imposed on these materials at the outset, but when the Conservatives under Brian Mulroney brought in the GST, they failed to establish an exemption for literacy materials. Despite the fact that the Liberals had 12 years to redress that issue, they failed to seize the opportunity and left the GST in place throughout their term in government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13772">In this minority Parliament we have the opportunity to do the right thing. Let us act together to remove the GST from all literacy materials. The measure would pay for itself. In our knowledge based economy the bar is being constantly raised higher on the base of skills needed to access decent jobs, to function in daily tasks and to participate in social and political life, and yet despite our technical sophistication, nearly 50% of Canadians still have difficulty working with words and numbers. It is in everyone's interest to raise Canadian literacy rates. As I said earlier, let us act now. It is the right thing to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13773">Similarly, if the government is intent on governing through tax cuts, then I have another proposal that would also be the right thing to do. I had the privilege yesterday of seconding the introduction of Bill C-275, an act to amend the Excise Tax Act on feminine hygiene products. The bill was brought forward by my good friend the NDP finance critic and member for Winnipeg North, who shares my belief that taxes on feminine hygiene products are discriminatory. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="13774">Charging GST on feminine hygiene products clearly affects women only. It unfairly disadvantages women financially solely because of their reproductive role. Our bill would benefit all Canadian women at some point in their lives and would be of particular value to women with lower incomes. If a proper gender based analysis had been done when the GST was introduced, this discriminatory aspect of the tax would never have been implemented.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13775"> I urge all members of the House to support this initiative. I am confident that members of the Conservative government will do so because of their announcement of support last October when they pledged to deal with the tampon tax. Failing to--</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="13779">In our budget we have outlined a $1.7 billion investment in new, cleaner transportation to get Canadians out of their cars and into public transit. That is an important initiative for Canadians to help end the pollution that we see in our cities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13780">Really important to me is that we will be moving to a 5% average renewable content in Canadian motor fuels. I am excited about this for a couple of reasons, for the benefit to the environment, which is important, but also for the benefit to our primary producers, our farmers. It will give farmers an opportunity to have one more market for their products to help them get through the terrible crisis they are going through right now and help the environment at the same time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13781">The government has also stated that it will review the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, CEPA, which will be the first serious review of it since 1987, and will also look at the Great Lakes water issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13782">The government is fully engaged on the environment. The environment minister has started us down the right path. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="13784">Mr. Speaker, I am really delighted at the intervention, because I ran out of time and now I have a whole whack more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13785">I understand that the Minister of the Environment this weekend will be in Bonn, Germany to chair a conference on climate change. I find it absolutely incredible that the government could send her there, given that the Conservatives have not bought into the Kyoto accord, that the budget offers no plan and that the single biggest tool for creating action on the environment, the budget, is largely silent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13786">While the hon. member raised a couple of points he would like me to consider, I would like the government to consider this: the EnerGuide program was cut. As of midnight, the level A audits are no longer allowed to be conducted. Not only does that hurt our environment, it hurts the lowest income families in our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13787">In my community of Hamilton, Green Venture has been conducting these audits on behalf of consumers and on behalf of low income families. It will have to potentially lay off up to four staff. This is completely counterproductive to the member's stated goal of wanting to improve the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13788">If the Conservatives are serious about wanting to address environmental issues, they should look at what they can do about the Kyoto plan, what they can do about energy retrofit programs and what they can do to encourage green industries. On none of those issues did their budget make a single bit of difference.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="13789">Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member on her comments with respect to the budget, a budget that attacks the most vulnerable in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13790">I know she is a new member so I should cut her some slack, but she really has to do her research if she wants to appear credible when she talks about the environment. She said there were no targets, but Canada had set targets. Even her own member talked about the $1.1 billion that we invested. She just passionately defended one of our programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13791">She should have listened to the speeches yesterday, if she were really interested in the environment and Kyoto. It was made quite clear that the Liberal government planned to implement 22 made in Canada plans and programs. These programs would have cut millions of tonnes of greenhouse gases. She cannot say that we were against biodiesel, considering the help we were giving for ethanol development, deepwater cooling, solar heating, wind energy, ground source heat pumps, photovoltaic, geothermal, landfill gas, biomass and low head hydro. We had one of the best auto agreements in the world to cut emissions. We were also in the process of developing legislation for large emitters. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13792">A number of Conservatives have said they believe that climate change is somewhat of a natural phenomena. For the NDP to be unaware of these 22 programs and for them not to support environmental initiatives in what environmental groups said was the greenest budget in history is not a very productive way to support the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13793"> I agree things could be improved. We could cut more greenhouse gas emissions. The emissions have gone up because our economy has been so successful, the greatest in the G-8. However, we have cut millions of tonnes. The NDP should support these programs. It should support these cuts and ask for even more. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="13794">Mr. Speaker, I hardly think New Democrats need to be lectured by a Liberal on environmental action. When the member's government was turfed out of office, emissions had gone up 25%, even more than those emissions under the Bush administration in the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13795">While I appreciate the member's more gentle comments at the beginning, when he congratulated me on my comments about vulnerable people in our communities, let me also use this opportunity to remind members that I have in fact done my research. We have talked to seniors in our communities. They are telling us that they are hurting more each day because their pensions, their fixed incomes, are not keeping up with things like increased property taxes, which would have been helped with some significant investment into municipal infrastructure. They are also being hurt by rising energy prices. With the cut of the EnerGuide program, these seniors have no hope of reducing those costs. We have to remember that public pensions have not been improved in any significant way.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="13798">I would like to take this opportunity to thank the voters and the citizens of Wellington—Halton Hills for giving me the privilege of representing them on the floor of the House of Commons for the second time. I am truly honoured by this trust and the confidence that the people have shown in me and I am determined to act in a manner that is consistent and worthy of that trust.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13799">I would also like to thank all the volunteers who assisted me in the most recent campaign. Many Canadians may not realize that there are literally tens of thousands of volunteers who help out. In any particular riding, there are hundreds of volunteers who assist in election campaigns. This is time that they take off work and it is time they take away from their families to participate in our democratic and civic processes. It is a commitment they make because they believe in the importance of our parliamentary institutions and in our democracy. I want to thank them especially for taking that time helping me and our government in that regard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13800">Anybody who has spent time in politics also realizes the enormous burden that our jobs and our work places on our families. I would also like to thank my wife Carrie for all the commitment she has shown over the last number of years in helping me with my work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13801">Budget 2006 delivers on our commitments. It is a balanced budget that focuses priorities and that delivers on many of the commitments we made in the most recent election campaign, including debt reduction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13802">In the recent election campaign, we made a number of commitments to the Canadian people. We broke them down into our key five priorities. I am happy to say that our budget delivers on many of those commitments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13803">Budget 2006 gives tangible expression to the things that we told Canadians we would do. During the election we said that we would commit to certain things. We have come to this House and we have done those things. There is no greater way to restore the trust and faith of Canadians in government than to do what we said we would do during election campaigns.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="13804">One of the government's top priorities is to enhance accountability to Canadians and transparency in government operations. The federal accountability action plan published on April 11 introduces a broad range of reforms, including the establishment of a position of parliamentary budget officer and a commitment to provide quarterly updates on fiscal forecasts for the current fiscal year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13805">The budget offers sweeping tax relief for individual taxpayers, totalling nearly $20 million over two years. That is as much relief as was provided in the last four budgets put together. Budget 2006 provides improved assistance to Canadians and their families, to the tune of $5.2 billion over two years. Budget 2006 invests $1.4 billion over two years in protecting Canadian families and communities, ensuring border security and enhancing public health emergency preparedness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13806">Over the same period, the budget will provide $73 million for making our financial system safer. The government is also committed to strengthening Canada's role on the international scene by investing $1.1 billion over two years in the Canadian Forces and striving to ensure the efficiency of international aid.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13807">In this budget, the government pledges to take immediate measures to restore fiscal balance in Canada and respond to concerns in that regard, by implementing the ten year plan to strengthen health care and—in conjunction with provincial and territorial governments—developing and introducing a wait time guarantee for necessary medical treatment, among other things.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="13808">The budget is also good news for Wellington—Halton Hills. In our area, many farmers over the last year have faced particularly devastating economic circumstances, especially farmers outside the supply managed system. They have indicated to us over the last number of years that they do need help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13809">Our government has responded. In the budget we fulfilled our election commitment to put an additional $500 million annually into farm income support. Budget 2006 not only delivers on that commitment, but it goes beyond that. Our government has deep roots in rural Canada and we understand the plight that farmers today face. The budget responds to those dire needs of many farmer by putting an additional $1 billion in budget 2006 into farm income support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13810">The total additional financial support that the Government of Canada has committed to Canadian farmers is $1.5 billion for this current fiscal year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13811">I am very glad I can go back to the citizens and the farmers of Wellington—Halton Hills and tell them that our government is committed to Canadian agriculture and that we will deliver on those commitments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13812">Like all provinces, Ontario faces infrastructure challenges. Our government made commitments during the election to help provinces and municipalities with infrastructure. The Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities has delivered on those commitments. Budget 2006 puts an additional $6.6 billion into infrastructure support: $2.4 billion for the highways and border infrastructure fund; $2 billion for the Canada strategic infrastructure fund; and $2.2 billion for the municipal rural infrastructure fund, also known as COMRIF, in Ontario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13813">In addition, we met our commitment during the election to continue with the previous government's gas tax commitments by committing an additional $4.4 billion over the next four years to deliver that gas tax on a per capita basis to Canada's municipalities. In budget 2006 municipalities in the province of Ontario will receive $233.9 million as part of that commitment to fulfill the gas tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13814">Another area that our government fulfilled its commitment on is the environment. During the election campaign, we committed to putting in place a 15.5% federal tax credit for public transit fees. We have delivered on that commitment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13815">We have also delivered our commitment to support the Canadian arts and Canadian culture by committing an additional $50 million over the next two years to ensure that arts and art institutions are supported. This money will go toward the Canada Council for the Arts to ensure that it can deliver and protect Canadian culture throughout our great country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13816">Finally, our government has been prudent in its financial planning and we have delivered $3 billion in debt reduction for the upcoming fiscal year. Our belief is that the best way to protect social programs is to run a good fiscal program and to ensure that the fiscal and monetary situation of the country is run in such a way that the Government of Canada has adequate resources in future years to deliver the programs that Canadians so value.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13817">In conclusion, before I take questions from members of the opposition, as Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and Minister for Sport, I am very proud on some of the commitments that our government has delivered in the budget. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13818">The budget offers immediate assistance to the citizens living in my riding of Wellington—Halton Hills and to all Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13819">It offers a clean plan for the future to effectively address many of the serious challenges our country faces and represents a tremendous step forward in the right direction for our great country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="13825">Our government tabled, as part of the budget, a paper entitled “Restoring Fiscal Balance in Canada”. In it, one of the problems that we identified in years past under the previous government had to do with transparency in budget planning. The budget paper outlines one of the problems that we have had in recent years. The government consistently underestimated the sizes of the surpluses. At year end, March 31 each year, the provinces were always surprised at the amount of the federal surplus because the government failed to be sufficiently transparent in this regard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13826">For example, just before the 2004 election, Canadians were told that the budget surplus would be $1.9 billion. It turned out to be $9.1 billion, a difference of almost 400% to 500%. As a result, provinces felt that the government was not being transparent with them with regard to fiscal transfers of the federation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13827">Our government acknowledges the problems of the previous government with respect to transparency and budget planning. That is why we have set out to establish an independent budgetary office that would be part of the federal accountability act, so that there would be greater transparency and greater accuracy in budget planning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13828">We have committed to dealing with the question of fiscal balance. We have acknowledged that this is an issue across the country. Obviously, the previous government had mixed messages on it. On the one hand, it indicated that it was not an issue, but on the other hand, it signed the Atlantic accord and the May memorandum with the province of Ontario to address its concerns about fiscal and federal transfers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13829">Our government has said that we received the Council of the Federation report. We welcome its feedback in this regard. We have received the budget paper. We are looking forward to the expert panel on territorial and equalization financing, also called the O'Brien report, that the previous government commissioned. Over the course of the coming months in the summer, the government will consult widely with the provinces on this issue and in the fullness of time, the Prime Minister will be putting forward proposals in this regard.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="13834">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to be here to speak about this government's new budget. I am very proud of our colleague, the Minister of Finance, and his hard work over the past few months. He has tabled a budget that reflects all the priorities of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13835">I am referring to, among other things, how this budget will reduce the rate of taxation for all Canadians. This budget will put in place a good number of the true priorities of Canadians. It is the first time in several years that a budget has been able to accomplish this. I am very pleased to speak about this budget, today.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="13836">Speaking with the people from my riding, the feedback I am hearing is overwhelmingly supportive. It seems that Edmontonians know that the budget is good for their city, good for the province, and obviously good for Canadians. They support a focussed agenda that will actually get results for a change. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13837">As someone who has stood before the House in the past to speak on budgets, especially being in the opposition, one of the key assessments that I have always had to make is to look at how the government's plans would actually affect the people who sent me here to represent them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13838">In the past, I will say as many have felt, it has been frustrating because despite a punishing tax regime that squeezed the average family, individuals and small businesses in my riding, people regularly had the sense that we were not receiving value for money. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13839">The previous government would announce billions in funding, but for average people, for real people in neighbours in my riding, the only results they ever saw was a creeping tax burden, a rising cost of living, the occasional press release announcing a new program, but no real help or support that ever seemed to make a difference. This budget is different.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13840">I am proud to say that our plan does more in one budget to help the diverse needs of people in my riding than the previous government was able to deliver in the last 13 years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13841">Individuals in Edmonton—Strathcona are hard-working people. There are students at the University of Alberta, small business owners, entrepreneurs on Whyte Avenue, and moms, dads and grandparents who put a premium on family. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13842">I am happy to say that the budget speaks directly to their needs and it does so in a way that leaves the maximum amount of flexibility for individuals to pursue their own goals in their own way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13843">It is in the spirit of respect and acknowledgement of the fact that individuals not bureaucrats know best that our budget seeks to make life easier for all Canadians. The government does not and cannot better understand the needs of a third year chemistry student trying to balance work and study to afford tuition at the University of Alberta. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13844">None of us here can pretend to know what is best for the restaurant owner trying to scrape the money together to expand on Whyte Avenue and we cannot certainly assume to better be prepared to tell the parents of young children in my riding how to raise their family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13845">In the past, the previous government sought to impose a one size fits all for its own solutions for these very real problems. Our vision is very different. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13846">We do not pretend that because people have different needs that government does not have a role to play in making life better, but what we do say is that people know best for themselves and that government's proper role is a supportive one. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13847">I am proud that the budget recognizes this fact and takes steps to position the federal government to help people achieve their goals and realize their dreams.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13848">One of those groups is students. For every single one of more than 35,000 students attending post-secondary studies at the University of Alberta in my riding, the budget delivers significant and meaningful assistance in the most direct way possible by getting out of the way and leaving students with more money in their pockets for their own priorities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13849">Our new government will help reduce the burden on students in Edmonton—Strathcona by providing an immediate tax credit to help all students with the cost of their textbooks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13850">For a full time student at the U of A this will mean a textbook tax credit of about $520 per year. This is money that will be left in the pockets of students and go toward any number of needs from groceries to school supplies, a ticket home to visit friends and family, or to start paying down some of their debt. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13851">Students need to be supported for their hard work in pursuit of academic excellence. That is why we took a bold move, that should have been done a long time ago, to exempt bursaries and scholarships from tax, so that when students are awarded some of the much needed financial assistance, they will not see that recognition clawed back to the federal coffers in Ottawa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13852">As I mentioned, I used to be a small business owner in my riding. I know firsthand the challenges faced by entrepreneurs and hard-working independent business owners who make our community so vibrant. Incredibly, I have long made the case to fix the problem. Government needs to do a lot less, not more. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13853">We need to leave individual business owners more of their hard-earned money to invest in how they see fit. This will mean more jobs and a more robust economy as small business owners find they have more money to expand, to take on more staff, and also make key investments. The budget delivers on that.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="13854">Entrepreneurs in my riding will have an additional $100,000 of qualifying income for the small business tax limit. Not only does this mean more business income than ever before will be protected from punitive tax rates, but our government has moved to reduce the small business tax rate by 1% over the next two years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13855">In addition to helping small business owners, we knew that all Canadians, regardless of who they are or what they do, deserve meaningful tax relief. That is why the government is providing tax relief people can actually see, tax relief that will affect every single Canadian. We will be immediately reducing the GST by 1%. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13856">The benefits of this commitment will be felt by every single individual in my constituency. I know, coming from a service industry business, the more that can be freed up in taxes, especially in the service industry, the more disposable income people will have to actually spend on particular items for their families or themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13857">For students, it means that the necessary expenses needed to get them to class will be cheaper. For business owners, it means customers will have more money to spend on their products and services and, more importantly, for families in my riding, it means an extra $400 on average every year that can be spent or saved as families see fit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13858">More often than not, government cannot spend money better than Canadians. This is a recognition that Ottawa can do more with less and that Canadians can do more with their own money. Instead of treating Canadians like a series of special interest groups, the budget recognizes that Canadians are individuals with their own goals and desires.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13859">I am thrilled that my constituents finally have a government that recognizes the need to support their choices by leaving them with more resources to carve out their own destiny. By providing broad based and meaningful tax relief, our fiscal plan will make a real difference for every single person in my riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13860">One point that I did not mention during the course of my speech relates to students and the link to small business. I know that one of the unfortunate restrictions in the past was that international students, who are now making up such a significant part of our student base across the country, were not able to work while they were spending time here in Canada. Often we would have those international students bring about $4 billion worth of investment into Canada every year by attending classes, taking up housing, and spending money when they came here to pursue their studies. Unfortunately, they were not able to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13861">As we know, in the budget there was the announcement that we have opened up that process to allow those international students to actually pursue employment here in Canada while they are attending school. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13862">As I mentioned, as a small business person in the service industry, I have noticed that there is a labour crunch right across this country. Many of the markets are finding it difficult to find people to work. Our budget will provide not only the chance for students to find work and raise some money to help pay for some of the costs that they incur, especially being away from home in an international location, but will also help fill the gap that we currently have in the employment market when it comes to the service industry by allowing some of those students to take up some meaningful employment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13863">I know that will make a huge difference to many people in my riding, especially when it comes to filling that labour shortage that many people are currently facing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13864">The budget is an excellent new start for the government. The budget sets some key priorities in the short term to achieve meaningful results. It sets a plan in place for the future, a bold vision that I think Canadians were so desperately needing after 13 years of mismanagement, corruption, and lack of attention to their needs.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="13867">Mr. Speaker, the wealthy and the big businesses of this country are very generous. They help a lot of people, but they did not ask for a budget that was built on the backs of students. I was amazed that the budget is such a slap in the face for students.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13868">When the Liberals were in government, they created the biggest scholarship program in history with thousands of dollars for students. The last Liberal budget proposed $6,000 for every student for tuition. In fact, for poor students, the amount was doubled to $12,000. What do students get in this budget? They receive an $80 tax credit on books.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13869">One of the Conservative members was asked during the budget debate what the government had done for single mothers and poor people. The member said that a single mother could go back to school with the $80 tax credit on books. I phoned my college bookstore and asked for the price of an average textbook. In fact, I asked for the price of three books. All three books were more than $80. I think the books cost $110, $120 and $130 each. I know that there are lots of books, so I wanted to be sure. I was told that the average book would cost $100.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13870">The Conservatives are telling single parents that they can go back to school and the government will help them with three-quarters of the price of a textbook. This is embarrassing. I would not boast about this part of the budget because it is not a serious attempt to help students.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="13871">Mr. Speaker, I have a lot of respect for the member in this House, but it is funny when he says that the government promised a lot, especially after what we saw in the deathbed conversion process during the campaign, when the Liberals were coming up with policies we had never heard from them in the last 13 years they were in power. They never made any meaningful changes to help students. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13872">The member talks about the bursaries or scholarships they implemented. It is all fine and dandy to say that was in fact done, but when students are taxed on that same income they are getting as bursaries or scholarships, it is almost doing reverse damage to them. That is why this government moved very quickly in the budget to remove that unfair tax on scholarships and bursaries. It should have been done a long time ago if the previous government really was committed to students, but it lacked the intention to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13873">Again, promises are all we heard from the Liberal government for over 13 years. I was in opposition for the last 9 of those 13 years, and there were some really great promises, let us face it. Did the Liberals actually follow through with any of them? I would say not.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="13874">Mr. Speaker, one of the things about this budget is what I think of as the lack in the opportunity to plug one of the most egregious tax loopholes out there. What I am talking about is what is called tax motivated expatriation, which is in fact the transferring of money offshore to tax havens, whereby companies can avoid paying their fair share of taxes in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13875">I sense that the Conservatives are generally sympathetic and think this practice should be stopped. It was used most notably by the former prime minister when Canada Steamship Lines was set up in the only tax haven left. The Liberals tore up all the tax treaties except for the one haven where Canada Steamship Lines happened to reside.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13876">If the Conservatives did not see fit to plug that tax loophole in this budget, would my colleague at least agree that companies that take advantage of these tax havens should not be able to get contracts from the federal government while they are taking advantage of this tax fugitive situation?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="13877">Mr. Speaker, I agree with my hon. colleague, especially in light of what we saw from the previous prime minister in taking advantage of that particular tax loophole. Obviously it was not the best way that Canadians like to see companies do business. I am willing to explore the idea of ensuring that contracts are done openly and transparently and given to the best people who are applying for those contracts with the federal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13878">I think the member's question speaks to a bigger issue that we have to address, and I think this government has already taken a step to address it. That issue is the overall tax burdens that Canadians and business have been facing in this country for years and years. The only reason many of these companies look at ways to shelter their incomes and to move them offshore is that clearly we have had a regime in this country that has had very strict and very high levels of tax on businesses. That has affected competition, their ability to invest and their ability to actually look at ways to hide that income in other places.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13879">I think we have moved in the right direction. We have to lower those tax levels. We have done so in this budget. We hope to continue down that track to keep our economy competitive and to stop that process of people looking at putting their money overseas.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="13880">Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for the great riding of Thunder Bay--Rainy River.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13881">After 13 years of Liberal government, Canada's economic and fiscal situation is among the best in the world. I hope the government would agree that it is extremely fortunate to inherit the strong economic house that was built and fostered by the governments that preceded it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13882">The budget we are debating today is in large part a budget of small advancements that is rigidly tied, it appears to me, to an ideology that really is the architecture of small government. It is in large part a short-sighted budget, in my mind. It is a budget that values political expediency, as the member from Markham pointed out, instead of long term stability or progressive investments in the future of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13883">Liberals believe the budget should have included, for example, a national child care system that offers quality and affordable child care to all Canadians. As well, it is a shame that the Kelowna accord, which finally turned a page and enabled Canada to move forward on improving the social and political situation of Canada's aboriginal people, was entirely neglected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13884">While the Prime Minister may want to focus his attention on five priorities, this country is far bigger than that. There are many challenges facing this country, as well as many opportunities. This is not the time to put on blinders and ignore the difficult issues that Canadians expect us to be working on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13885">That said, the budget is not entirely without merit. There are some very positive aspects. The Conservative budget, for example, talks about tax relief, and the kind that applies to all Canadians equally, sales tax relief. It is a positive way to encourage our citizens to become more productive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13886">Don Johnson, a tireless crusader for the arts and social causes, has long been an advocate of tax abatement for those who give stock contributions to charities. Thanks to his hard work and tireless advocacy, a total exemption for charitable stock contributions was included in this budget. That is a good thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13887">My riding is a thriving bastion for small business. Over 95% of all businesses in Canada are small businesses. They are responsible for not only the spirit and drive we find in York South--Weston, but also for nearly half the jobs created in Canada every year. I am glad, and I am sure all members in the House are glad, to see that the threshold for small business income eligible for the reduced federal tax rate will be increased to $400,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13888">We are also glad to see that the government has listened to the many members on all sides of the House and has pledged to support our police forces. Funding those who shield our municipalities and protect our provinces and our people is a noble and necessary pursuit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13889"> At the federal level, the RCMP need to be equipped with the latest technology and capable of handling the most challenging of investigative tasks. This budget at least recognizes that there has long been a shortfall in the funding of the mounted police. An accomplished force with such a rich history and storied symbolism deserves the best we can offer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13890">However, I am compelled to talk about some of the shortcomings of the budget. I wish I could say more positive things about what is being offered the rest of Canada, but sadly there is not that much. This is a budget that fails the regions, fails our health care system, fails our first nations and fails the environment. I would like to expand on the reasoning behind this statement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13891">First of all, I would like to expand on how this budget fails our health care system. During the election, the Conservative Party made wait times reduction one of their five core priorities. During his budget speech on May 2, the hon. Minister of Finance said his government was “committed to implementing the 10-Year Plan to Strengthen Health Care”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13892"> The Conservatives' federal budget provides no additional funding for wait time reduction, nor any explanation as to how their wait times guarantee will be implemented. What happened to the Conservative priority of fixing wait times? They promised to outdo the Liberals, yet their budget invests no more funding for wait times reduction beyond what the Liberal government already committed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13893"> How will the Conservatives pay for their wait times guarantee? Will they download costs to the provinces and territories without giving them more funding to cope? Despite their criticism of the Liberal government's 10 year plan to strength health care, this plan has now become the core pillar of their health care platform. Now that the groundwork has been laid by the previous Liberal government, the Conservatives seem ready to claim its successes as their own.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="13894">It was the Liberal government that worked with the provinces and territories to establish benchmarks for medically acceptable wait times, to set reduction targets for key medical procedures, to create the $5.5 billion wait times reduction fund, and to integrate foreign-trained medical professionals to supplement shortages within the Canadian medical field.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13895">The Conservative government seems to have overlooked not only one of its own priorities but the number one priority for Canadians: a better, stronger health care system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13896">The budget also fails our children and working parents. The Conservative budget fails to provide a real child care choice for parents. Twenty dollars a week for child care is simply not enough. Low income parents will also be losing the young child supplement of the Canada child tax benefit. The Conservatives are cutting $1 billion from the child tax benefit, which was supposed to reach $10 billion next year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13897">The budget fails our first nations people. The hon. Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development has implied that he has doubts whether the $5 billion for the Kelowna accord was actually budgeted for by the previous Liberal government. This commitment is so fundamental that it is vital to dispel any such doubts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13898">The previous Liberal finance minister has confirmed that as of November 24, 2005, the day of the first ministers meeting when the agreement was signed, the fiscal framework of the Government of Canada included a total of $5.096 billion to address obligations arising from the Kelowna accord.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13899">In the Liberal government's 2005 economic and fiscal update on November 14, the importance of the then upcoming Kelowna meeting was specifically stated, together with an undertaking to provide the needed financing, and there was more than enough unused fiscal room in our framework to accommodate the expected sum. When the Kelowna meeting actually took place 10 days later, the money was booked.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13900">The fiscal treatment of the Kelowna accord was quite similar to how we handled special federal funding of $755 million to help grains and oilseed producers in the farm sector. Although we are pleased that the Conservative government has proceeded with our $755 million commitment to help farmers, it is just as important that it also follow through on our parallel commitment to aboriginal peoples, delivering the funding that was most certainly set aside for this compelling purpose on November 24.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13901">What looms ominously over the budget is the Prime Minister's commitment to cutting $1 billion worth of unidentified programs each year for the next two years. Does that means that the right hon. Prime Minister intends to cut these things: the northern strategy, which ensures that economic development opportunities are developed in partnership with northern Canadians; the Mackenzie gas project, which increases federal and regional capacity; and the oceans action plan, which improves oceans management and preserves the health of Canada's oceans?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13902">This budget also fails the environment on the commitment to Kyoto. The government has eliminated climate change programs and is getting ready to pull out of the Kyoto accord. Its transit tax credit is costly and ineffective. It will cost almost $400 million over two years and will increase transit use by only 5%. This translates to a cost of $2,000 for each tonne of carbon dioxide saved, and that will be 10 to 100 times the cost per tonne under the Liberal project green plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13903">The budget also fails Ontario. A year ago, the Liberal government and the Government of Ontario signed an agreement that would see Ontario receive $7 billion in federal funding. This money was to be used by Ontario's government to help convert coal-fired power plants to natural gas, expand public transit, augment funding for universities and community colleges, and bring the province up to the same level as the rest of the country in federal spending on immigration settlement and job training programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13904">During the election, the Prime Minister promised to uphold this agreement and transfer every single dollar of the deal to Ontario. Yesterday we learned that the Prime Minister's Minister of Finance has written to his provincial counterpart and informed him that the money on its way to Ontario will be $3 billion short of what was promised. This is no way to retune the Ontario economic engine, which in fact transfers through equalization two-thirds of the total amount of money that goes to those fiscally disadvantaged provinces in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13905">This budget fails Canada. This budget is all about short term gain in exchange for long term pain. The budget has failed all Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="13906">Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for painting such a negative picture of our budget. I would like to draw his attention to this, though: by virtue of their attitude over the past 13 years, the Liberals came very close to ruining Canada because they did not recognize the fiscal imbalance. Today, the Conservative Party's budget does recognize that fiscal imbalance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13907">Since, by voting against the budget, the Liberals denied the existence of the fiscal imbalance, can my colleague explain why all Canadians acknowledge that it exists? By voting against the budget, the Liberals do not recognize the fiscal imbalance, when everyone knows that it exists. I would like to hear my colleague's answer about this fiscal imbalance that his party refuses to recognize.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="13908">Mr. Speaker, let us use a case in point. I would like to expand a bit on the case that I use in terms of Ontario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13909">We do recognize that there is a fiscal imbalance. More than that, we realize that if we do not invest in the manufacturing economy of the province of Ontario, for example, at a time when natural resource based economies are booming, that is the economic engine that in terms of our federal history has produced the kinds of prosperity that we have all enjoyed. That budget does not do it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13910">I do not know what the member means in terms of challenging this side of the House. This is not the side of the House that he should be looking at. He should be looking at his side of the House because it is that side, through this budget, that is not going to generate the multipliers, transform the economy to the extent that we create jobs in high value added activity such that there is more of the economic pie that we can then equalize across this great nation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13911">That has been the history. That is what the Liberal Party and Liberal governments recognized and that is what they did so well, that this budget is not going to do, and that is tragic.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="13912">Mr. Speaker, I do not think it is helpful to watch my colleagues point fingers at each other and blame one another for the recent state of affairs, or even the state of the nation, because they are both to blame to some degree.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13913">It may be something of a cliche to say that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, but I now have the empirical evidence here that in fact this is true. The average total income for all families might be the best measurement of how we are doing economically.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13914">The average total income for all family units from 1989 to 2004, in quintiles, was: in the lowest quintile, the bottom 20%, the standard of living went down by 9%; in the second lowest quintile, $30,000 a year, it actually dropped by 4%; in the third quintile, the standard of living dropped by 3%. These figures are for 1989 to 2004, so there were some Tory years and some Liberal years. The only quintile that went up is the highest quintile, which went up 23%. These are not left-wing pinko figures; these are statistics. This is the truth. This is what really happened. Canadians are not better off.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13915"> For all the equality measures that we talk about and the successive budgets that are designed to make Canadians' lives better for most of us, 60% of us at least, we are dropping and only the rich are getting richer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13916">I would ask my colleague, does he not agree that equality should be the goal here and elevating the standard of living of all Canadians should be the goal and that something has gone terribly wrong?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="13918">I would like to direct my colleague to the 10 year trend with respect to the income tax reductions that had been distributed through the surplus to those who fit into that very category he talked about. If he looks at that 10 year trend under the budgets that were brought forward by a Liberal government, he will see that while it has not been fast enough, there was definitely an improvement in those lower categories through the regime and architecture that the Liberals had supported. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13919">That is not the trend nor the pattern nor the philosophy of the current government through this budget. It is going to go in exactly the opposite way.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="78979" Type="2" Desc="">Mr. Ken Boshcoff (Thunder Bay—Rainy River, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="13920">Mr. Speaker, in my address in terms of the implementation of the budget, I will show what will happen in northwestern Ontario, particularly in Thunder Bay—Rainy River. There should be several good things, and rightly so, as the government inherited one of the best financial situations of any provincial or federal government in recent memory. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13921">Nonetheless, when we think about what is good, what is bad, what is missing or what the Conservative government has adopted in continuing previous government policies, the first thing that comes to mind is how offensive the raising of the income tax rate for the poor is. People all across the country are offended, hurt and indeed embarrassed by hurting the poorest classes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13922">The cancellation of the early learning and child care agreements in northwestern Ontario means the loss of 1,400 spaces that were desperately needed. Of course, Ontario and indeed all those provinces across the country that uploaded the child care support will now be facing the fact that they will have to download them again and raise property taxes in those municipalities. When that starts happening, people will really know the serious effect of this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13923">The slashing of the forestry agreement from $1.5 billion to $400 million is of concern to many northwestern Ontario companies that have been struggling over the past number of years, and in particular are paying the penalty of not having a chance to get that $1 billion of illegal duties paid back to them and only get 78% of that. For example, the Ontario industry has paid 12% of all the duty submitted and of that provincial portion northwestern Ontario companies have paid nearly 60% of that total. That is nearly $300 million out of the communities in and around my riding of Thunder Bay—Rainy River.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13924">When asked about how good the softwood deal was, yes it has been rejected many, many times in the past number of years and indeed the reason the previous deal was never accepted is that it is not going to help us. For example, no money will likely be returned in less than nine months, but more important to the people of northwestern Ontario, the provincial and federal governments will not be permitted to change forestry policies in any manner that could be interpreted as assisting the forestry industries because of the terminology of the anti-circumvention measure. This means that for northwestern Ontario producers who are pushing for regional energy, as we call it, once that became implemented by the provincial government, an American company could simply overrule it and roll that back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13925">When we talk about the impact on tourism of the passport restrictions, there are no programs in the budget to assist border communities and no funding to educate Americans and Canadians about these changes. Indeed for communities such as Morson in my riding which depend heavily on tourism, because of the FedNor program we were recently able to expand cell tower and broadband services. This will greatly enhance tourism because tourists can use their cell phones and computers. But tourists will stop coming. That has already begun to happen and we have to be on full alert about this. Many people in the United States actually think that the passport requirement is a Canadian program. On top of all of this, significant progress had been made by American legislators, mayors and reeves of border communities, and the tourism industry, so we did not have to roll over on this one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13926">In terms of the Trans-Canada Highway, the previous agreement signed last year with the province of Ontario should allow us to continue with federal-provincial funding for a national highway program. We look forward to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13927">In terms of agriculture, my riding has a considerable amount of agriculture as it spans a seven and a half hour drive over two time zones. The beef, dairy, and grains and oilseeds farmers are somewhat dismayed that they will get less this year than they did from the previous government. That is a concern for them, particularly when we know full well the impact on the grains and oilseeds right now during planting season.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="13928">I congratulate the government for continuing the FedNor program. I believe the Conservatives understand its value and I thank them very much for that. We hope that the program will also allow the people of the town of Fort Frances and the Rainy River district to benefit with the purchase of the privately owned bridge. With the FedNor contributions and the ministry of transport's assistance, we are looking forward to some kind of help for the town of Fort Frances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13929">From the health perspective, the regional cancer research centre has received support already from the municipality, the province and the private sector. All it is waiting for now is the federal contribution so hopefully that will come shortly. The minister is welcome to come to my riding and make that announcement at his convenience.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13930">Environmentally there is a very high degree of awareness in Thunder Bay, very cost effective programs and a great deal of community buy-in. The loss of a program such as EcoSuperior was a dramatic hit. It was enlisting strong community based support for environmental programs and awareness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13931">When talking about the hopper car deal, the FRCC, the people of Thunder Bay, the port authority and I had been looking forward to an agreement. Now that the deal has been turned back to the railways, this will hurt all the communities along the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway, and particularly the port of Thunder Bay. That has been greeted with considerable dismay.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13932">We are also concerned about the lack of identification of the continuance of regional programs for such organizations as the CBC. This would greatly take the pressure off that station which services an area larger than France and a couple of other European countries put together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13933">If we have a goal of becoming the most literate nation in the world, support for literacy programs is conspicuously absent in the budget, particularly support for aboriginal literacy. I am hoping that is perhaps a small print item that we will hear more about in the next little while.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13934">Ridings such as mine have considerable distance and travel times. The Conservatives have previously campaigned on and made many overtures in the House about lowering gas prices. The fact that nothing has been mentioned about that has many of my constituents calling me. Even people who had supported that party in the last election have expressed considerable dismay and have referred to articles quoting the current Prime Minister and many members of that party about gasoline pricing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13935">The absence of mention of health care in the budget is something which many people have mentioned. If the government will be continuing the health care accord, then that is very significant. It would be an understanding that that was a significant achievement and that the current government understands how well the previous prime minister and former minister of health had done in bringing people together to come to an accord. It was historic and appreciated indeed by the whole nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13936">I do not have time to dwell on many other topics, but there are some that I would like to mention. The government deserves credit for the apprenticeship programs for small business. If there are plans to build a prison for $500 million and $500 million worth of operating costs, please put one in my riding. We would be glad to take it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13937">When we talk about a budget we cannot just be negative and cynical. Every budget tries to put the government's best foot forward. I hope that I have identified some of the shortcomings, some of the good things, some of the things that are missing. I hope that members in the House today understand that when we make a point it is to try to make improvements. If there is a shortcoming, members should not get all defensive, negative and hostile. They should just know that someone is trying to make it better and I would ask hon. members to understand that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="13938">Mr. Speaker, the member mentioned 1,400 child care spaces in his region of the province of Ontario. He claims that those spaces will no longer exist. In truth, they never did exist. The reality is that after 13 years of Liberal government promises, of which he was a part, not a solitary child care space was created and billions of dollars were spent. There were no results, zero, zip and zilch, in that order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13939">Today we are confronted with a new debate. Do we continue with the path of the last 13 years where the Liberal government had promised $1 billion a year to create day care spaces, which 19 out of 20 children would not have received a solitary space? Let us do the simple math of one child care space costing $40 a day and multiplying that times the number of business days in an entire year. If one plays the math out, there would be enough money for about 1 in every 20 kids to have a day care space. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13940">Automatically all the families who have a stay at home parent, or who rely on a family member to take care of children, or who send their children to a religious-based child care option, or who have a neighbourhood nanny, all those options, which polls show are far preferred by parents, would automatically have been excluded by that plan. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13941">We have a choice that is very simple: a 1 in 20 chance at a government day care space for one's child or a 100% chance at a $1,200 a year choice in child care allowance. The choice is a universal system of $1,200 for every preschooler or an exclusive government run option, which gives a child care space to 1 in every 20 children. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="13945">Clearly, history will prove that in 1993 the reason the child care program could not begin was because of the very sorry state of affairs the country had inherited. It took that many years to get out of that. The fact that we can get into a situation in our country where we are the leader of the G-7 is very significant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13946">For my riding, clearly child care spaces, which would have been created from the money that came from the federal government, is now being used by the provincial government to take care of the existing spaces for the next four years. It is essentially an uploading of that program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13947">Make no mistake about it, all municipalities are keenly aware of the hit they have taken in terms of early learning and care.

              <ParaText id="13949">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to rise today on behalf of the hard-working families of Palliser, on behalf of seniors, producers, small business people and students in my constituency who told me that during the last federal election, they wanted a government in Ottawa that would deliver responsible spending and real tax relief to put money back into their pockets after more than a decade of Liberal mismanagement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13950">Our government has delivered on that commitment with our first budget. When I went home after the budget last weekend, Palliser residents told me this was a good budget and that our government was on the right track.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13951">We have delivered on our commitment to tax relief. In fact, the budget delivers $20 billion in tax relief over two years. As has been said by many members, that is more than the last four Liberal budgets combined.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13952">If there was one thing I heard again and again on the doorsteps of Palliser residents during the last election campaign, it was that they were overtaxed. Is it any wonder that they felt that way? Under the previous Liberal government, billions of dollars were taken from Canadians through overtaxation and wasted on scandals and boondoggles such as the sponsorship program and a costly and ineffective gun registry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13953">Meanwhile, families in Palliser are working longer, paying more in taxes and saving less than they were 13 years ago, but I am proud to say that all that has changed under the new Conservative government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13954">The bottom line of budget 2006 is that every resident of Palliser, every family in Saskatchewan and every person across this great country will see real tax relief.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13955"> In the budget our government has committed to reducing the GST from 7% to 6%, effective July 1 of this year and creating a new $1,000 Canada employment credit, which starts effective July 1. We will reduce the lowest personal income tax rate from 16% to 15.5%, effective July 1. We will increase the amount that all Canadians can earn without paying federal income tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13956"> We will create a new apprenticeship job creation tax credit of up to $2,000 per apprentice. We will completely eliminate the federal income tax on all income from scholarships, bursaries and fellowships while creating a new text book tax credit for post-secondary students. I can not say how much I would have liked that to have been in place when I was a student while the Liberals were in power. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13957">We will provide a physical fitness tax credit for up to $500 to cover registration fees for children's sport, which was very well received by parents with one, two or three kids in sports in my riding. We will double the amount of eligible pension income that seniors can claim under the pension income credit, the first such increase in more than 30 years delivered by the government and the Prime Minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13958">As I said, budget 2006 delivers $20 billion in tax relief over two years. That is more tax relief than the last four federal budgets combined. For every $1 in new spending, we have delivered $2 in real tax relief back to Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13959">As a result of these measures, residents of Saskatchewan will pay $250 million less in taxes in 2007. Families earning between $15,000 and $30,000 a year will be better off by almost $300 a year in 2007. Those earning between $45,000 and $60,000 will save almost $650. Those are real results for families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13960">Unlike the previous government, our government has focused spending on key federal priorities, Canadians' priorities, that will get results and provide value for taxpayers money. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="13962">A significant example of this is the new universal child care benefit. As of July 1, Palliser families will receive $1,200 per year for each child under six. That is real results. That is real money in the pockets of constituents in my riding, not fictional spaces, not promised spaces. We heard promises for 13 years with no delivery. This is money in the hands of families. We will also spend $250 million, beginning in 2007, to create child care spaces. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13963">We have also followed through on our commitment to make our streets safer and to reduce the crime epidemic that is sweeping our communities. We heard from the Liberal member opposite that he would welcome a prison in his riding. We can have that debate another time. I invite him to come on over and join us as we get tough on crime in the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13964">Under federal Liberal and provincial NDP governments, my home province of Saskatchewan holds the dubious distinction of being Canada's crime capital. When I talk to seniors in Moose Jaw and families in Regina about the problem of crime, they have told me clearly that it is time to get tough on crime and tough on criminals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13965">During the last Parliament, I demanded many times that the former Liberal government get tough on drug crimes to address the crystal meth epidemic, which continues to sweep our province. The residents of Palliser indicated during the last election that they were tired of begging the Liberals to take action and that we needed a new government in Ottawa that was serious about getting tough on serious crimes. With the budget, we are keeping our word. We are cracking down on crime. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13966">We will provide $161 million to put more RCMP officers on the streets. We will invest $37 million in my home city of Regina for the RCMP to expand its national training academy. This is great news for Regina and the province of Saskatchewan. We will provide $20 million for communities to use to develop programs designed to prevent youth crime. We will provide the money that is required to arm our border agents. We have delivered on our commitment to make our streets and our borders safer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13967">I want to turn now to agriculture and what budget 2006 delivers to agricultural producers, who are the backbone of Palliser's economy. Farming is part of our heritage. Farmers feed our cities and keep our rural communities strong. Falling prices and trade disputes are causing them real financial hardship. People are suffering. They are losing farms that have been in their families for generations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13968">Current insurance and income support programs are not doing enough, and we cannot allow this to continue. That is why our government will restore and sustain a strong, vibrant farm sector which provides the income farmers need to live.</ParaText>

We are now going further. In budget 2006 our government is committing an additional $2 billion in funding over two years, $1.5 billion of which will be allocated in this budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13970">During the election we committed to an additional $500 million for farm support programs, and we are delivering on that promise. We will provide an additional $500 million per year for farm support. We will provide a one time investment of $1 billion to help farmers in the transition to more effective programming for farm income stabilization and disaster relief.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13971">Unlike the previous Liberal government, which lurched from crisis to crisis on the farm gate without any real vision or commitment to improving things, our government has begun the process of scrapping the CAIS and replacing it with programs that are simpler for farmers and that will actually deliver results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13972">As the residents of Palliser understand and appreciate, the Conservative government has delivered on its key priorities. Families, seniors, students and working people will all see tax relief in this budget and new spending which addresses their priorities and improves their security. We have also addressed health care, which is of particular importance to the residents of Palliser. Despite being the home of Tommy Douglas, Saskatchewan continues to experience the longest wait lists in the country under an NDP government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13973"> It is unfortunate that two parties did not support the budget. I do not know how they are going to go home and look their constituents in the eye and explain why they voted against real tax relief and real help for families in our country.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="13974">Mr. Speaker, I do not know how that member is going to go home and tell the poor people in his riding that he is increasing their income tax from 15% to 15.5%. I invite all the people at home to look at their income tax forms. I would not have brought this up if he had not said it was a reduction. I ask people to look at their income tax forms, at the column with the lowest rate. It is 15% this year. On July 1 it goes up to 15.5%. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13975">That is not the only reduction for low income people. The low income tax credit for young children has been removed. As for the $1,200, with cuts to that because of their income tax and other benefits they lose, it could be as low as $200 for low income people. The Caledon Institute said that, not the opposition. That is 55¢ a day for day care. How is the member going to tell stay at home parents that they will receive 55¢? The member for Nepean—Carleton just said it costs $40 a day and the government is giving 55¢.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13976">The government is cutting culture by two-thirds of the increase it was going to get. How can government members be proud of that?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13977">However, my question is about the broken promises, which seem to be adding up. Why was there so much talk about defence? Actually, I really enjoy our defence minister and I think he is a great minister, but he got scooped. Our party had larger increases for defence. After all the hyperbole, the Conservatives did not give such a big increase and there is no talk about equipment. The three icebreakers, which I was delighted to hear about, have vanished since the campaign promises.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13978">I would like to ask the member about the capital gains tax promise that has now vanished from the budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13979">The member also mentioned agriculture. The last part of my question is about how the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance had a prebudget meeting. I congratulate her for that. It was reported to me that when Conservative members asked her where the $1.5 billion was, as the member just suggested, she said, “Oh, we can't talk about that until it has been through cabinet”. Then the Conservative members asked, “Where is the money for this spring? How is this money going to flow?” The answer was, “Oh, we don't know that”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13980">The farmers need money for this spring. Not a single Conservative member yet has mentioned any possible mechanism by which the farmers will be able to get any of that $1.5 billion to stop the bankruptcies that are going on right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13981">Just so we do not get the common question about what our government did, let us remember that statistically and financially in the last several years we gave the largest funding to farmers at any time in history.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="13982">Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to respond to some of those comments. If we look at the press coverage of the budget, what we will see from poll to poll is that Canadians love this budget. They love what they are seeing from this Prime Minister and this government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13983">Let us look at the tax relief. There is $20 billion in tax relief over two years, which is incredible, more than the last four Liberal budgets put together. We have to look at the totality of the package. We have to look at everything. There is the employment tax credit, for example. We have to look at all the ways that the government is putting money back in the hands of hard-working Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13984">There is money for child care, the $1,200 a year. The member talks about how much that equates to per day et cetera. Let us look at how much money hundreds of thousands of families across this nation received under the previous Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13985"> Let us count it up. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13986">What about shift workers in this country? How much did they get under the previous Liberal plan? Nothing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13987">How about people who utilized a neighbourhood day care or a trusted family member? What did they get? Nothing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13988">What about mom or dad who chose to stay at home and raise children? How much did they get under the previous Liberal government?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13989">
                <B>Some hon. members:</B> Nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13990">
                <B>Mr. Dave Batters:</B> Absolutely nothing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13991">What about people in rural Saskatchewan, where there is no licensed day care facility? What did they get under the previous Liberal government? Absolutely nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13992">It goes on. Let us talk about the transit passes, the almost 16% credit that people across the country will get for any mode of transport they choose to use. We have to look at the totality of the package. That is a fantastic measure to improve our environment as well. As for the members opposite who say this is not going to encourage anyone to ride public transit, they clearly have not been in their ridings and they have not been listening to their constituents. My constituents are loving that measure. They think it is very positive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13993">As for money for farmers, that question is just a softball question, and it is almost as though one of my own members gave me this question, because no matter which way we look at it, it is $1.5 billion more than that party, the previous Liberal government, committed to our producers. Yes, it is not a panacea and it is not a cure-all, but it is real money for farmers, money that is going to keep people on their land and enable them to keep farms that have been in their families for generations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13994"> That member is $1.5 billion short.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="13995">Mr. Speaker, that is a tough act to follow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13996"> I suppose those members who have been here longer have noticed that my number of interventions in the House has really decreased in the last year and a half or two years. It used to be that I was up all the time on everything. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13997">I was asked the other day why I have turned really quiet. I responded by saying that we are now surrounded by very capable new members. I just feel I do not want to dominate the proceedings. I want to give them a chance to develop their debating skills as well and they are doing just fine. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13998">My hon. colleague from Palliser has done us proud in the last little while, and I really appreciate that. It is such an honour to be here with all of these good quality, highly principled people who want to do what is good for this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="13999">As members know I taught math for many years. One of the things that really disturbs me is the lack of mathematical knowledge by the members on the other side. Somehow they cannot get it into their heads that when they compare two numbers, and most of us would look at it and say this number is less than that one, they call it a tax increase. They are just out of it. What they are failing to take into account is the fact that the income tax rate on the lowest category is 16%. The update that provided for that to be reduced has never been passed by this Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="14000">The fact of the matter is that even though the Liberals say that they did this and it was announced in their budget, it has never had the approval of Parliament. They cannot say that the tax rate has been increased. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="14001">Even if the tax rate had been increased and let me take that stance just for their benefit for a few milliseconds. Let us say that 15% would have been approved and it would be in place, we are talking about 15.5% now. My question to the members opposite is very simple, who instead of listening keep heckling here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="14002">
                <B>Some hon. members:</B> It was approved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="14003">
                <B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B> Just listen to the master math teacher for a few milliseconds, if I may suggest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="14004">How much money is this? I will take $35,000 as an example. The $35,000 at 15.5% is equal to $5,425. It is curious that if we were to charge a rate of 15%, we would come up with exactly the same number if the taxable income is $36,167, which is about what it would have been under the Liberal plan. It is actually fairly close.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="14005">All of the individuals earning income and paying income tax under our plan have an additional $1,000 that they can earn tax free because of the benefit for employment. We have now another $1,000 that we are not paying tax on at all. Zero. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="14006">As a result, the 15.5% on the amount that is remaining is actually less tax than if we paid 15% on the larger amount. All they have to do is to put on their math caps for a second and let it sink in. That is how it works. One number is not bigger than the other because of the tax rate. It is actually smaller because of the fact that we are paying on a lesser amount. When one adds to this the fact that this will benefit all families, this is a tremendous thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="14007">I am a little older now and I do not know whether I should announce it to everyone, but it was just yesterday that I turned 67. It is a long time since we had young children running around the house, but I still remember when my wife and I decided that she would be a full time mom. We decided that the best care for our children was parental care. In order to accommodate that choice, I had to take on the teaching of some night classes in order to pay my taxes.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="25">(1425)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="14008"> In order to live on my income alone, we made sacrifices to make that happen because it was important, but there was no recognition for it to speak of in the tax act. We just made the sacrifice with after tax dollars. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="14009"> I took on teaching a night class at NAIT, where I worked, in order to supplement our income so we could pay our bills. I used to tell people that on Tuesday nights I was working for Trudeau. On Thursday nights I was working for my family. That is because about half of my incremental income went to taxes, so not only did we have the loss of my wife's income because she was a full time mom, we also had a penalty because when I did that extra work, I had to pay tax at the higher rate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="14010">I am so happy to be a part of a political party that looks at the value of a tax system for families and is saying that it will allow those families to make a real choice. There is no doubt in my mind whatsoever that the absolute best child care that children can get in those early formative years is the care of mom and dad. There is no doubt about that. There is a lot of data available if we were to look for it, in fact it is available, that proves that to be true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="14011">Mr. Speaker, I can read body language. I taught for 31 years. When I see somebody sitting like this, I know he is ready to go, so I will now interrupt my speech and hope to continue it at the next sitting.</ParaText>
