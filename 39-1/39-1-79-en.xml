              <ParaText id="256044">Canada's new government has introduced a tax fairness plan to assist all senior couples who receive pension income. This plan helps seniors in two ways.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256045">First, it reduces taxes for low income and middle income seniors by increasing the age credit amount by $1,000, retroactive to January 1 of this year. Second, effective January 1, 2007, senior couples will be allowed to split all pension income that is currently eligible for the pension income credit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256046">Pension income splitting is here after a 40 year wait. Our tax fairness plan is an important step in improving the quality of life that Canadian seniors enjoy, especially after the amount of time and effort they have given to this country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="256362">Mr. Speaker, we heard the discussion yesterday by other parties that spoke to Bill <Document DbId="2413948" Type="3">C-31</Document>, the voter integrity bill, and now the NDP is here to put forward its issues and concerns about the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256363">I want to say at the outset that the member for <Affiliation DbId="78825" Type="2">Acadie—Bathurst</Affiliation>, who is a member of the procedure and House affairs committee, was a member of the committee when the report was done, a report that was based on the bill before us. However, I should make it clear that the bill only deals with a few of the matters that came from the report. I was at committee when the Chief Electoral Officer, Mr. Kingsley, responded to the issues in the report. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256364">The bill deals with a voter identification system based on the premise that fraud and serial voting take place and therefore we need a voter identification system in our national registry and in our voting system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256365">The NDP is very supportive of the need to take measures to ensure fraud does not take place within the voting system. It is very important that we protect the integrity of the system. We are talking about a time honoured, democratic process where eligible voters have a proper place to vote and we have integrity in our system. From that point of view, we support the need to review the system and ensure measures are in place to lower the risk of fraud. I am sure it cannot be eliminated 100%, but measures should be in place to offer that protection. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256366">What is being offered as the main solution to this problem is a voter identification system. In looking at the bill and knowing where this came from at committee, we want to express some of our concerns about what may be the unintended consequences of the ID system on voters. In particular, we are concerned about how this would impact low income people, people who live in small remote communities and aboriginal people who do not have the necessary ID outlined in the bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256367">I represent the riding of <Affiliation DbId="78973" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation> where, in one community, the downtown east side, regrettably and unfortunately, many people do not have IDs through no fault of their own. These people are often homeless and often transient and they have difficulty getting government ID. They certainly do not have photo ID. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256368">One of the problems with the bill is that it would require one piece of photo ID from any level of government or two pieces of ID that are authorized by the Chief Electoral Officer. A further provision in the bill says that an elector who is not registered can take a statutory oath if he or she is accompanied by an elector with ID whose name appears on the list of electors for the same polling division. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256369">On the surface this may sound like a reasonable measure in that it would allow people with no ID to have some mechanism to vote. However, I have looked at this carefully and have talked to lawyers in my community who have been involved in providing assistance around statutory declarations for voters with no ID, and they are very concerned, as I am, about what this provision will mean.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256370">At present, it is acceptable for a voter to make a statutory declaration along with a person in the community who can identify the voter. In the downtown east side, it has often been a street worker, someone who knows many of the people in the community, who vouches for the individual. Under the new bill this would no longer be allowed.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="40">(1540)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="256371">We are very concerned that this provision may have a very negative consequence and may disenfranchise potentially thousands and thousands of people who will now, through no fault of their own, not be able to vote.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256372">We are prepared to see this bill go to committee. The government has said that it is willing to look at amendments that would correct this to ensure that by dealing with voter fraud, we are not at the same time unintentionally disenfranchising people who have a right to vote, who want to vote and who are voting legitimately, but would be precluded from doing so by these new provisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256373">When the bill goes to committee, it is our intention to see substantive improvements and changes made to this bill to address what are very fundamental democratic issues. One of the provisions in the bill is that a person vouching for another can only do it for one person. This would set up a very complicated system where people who are not registered and who do not have ID would be running around trying to find somebody else who is registered, is on the list and does have the proper ID, and then getting that one person to vouch for one person. It would create a very complex situation and could mean that a lot of people would not get to vote.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256374">It may also impact more middle class voters who go to the polls thinking that because they are registered they are okay. They have the voter cards and some ID, only to find that when they get there they do not have the proper ID. We may actually be frustrating those people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256375">I would also point out that this has been an issue in the U.S. elections and in fact there have been some court challenges. A similar provision was struck down in Georgia and there is currently a challenge going on in Ohio. In the United States, there is no centralized voter registration or election apparatus. It is contingent upon each state, and varies from each state, but a similar provision has been used in the U.S. and it actually has caused immense problems in the current elections that were just held yesterday. Challenges are underway and some of the provisions in some states have already been struck down. We should learn from this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256376">In terms of the principle of dealing with fraud, we support that but we do want to ensure we are not setting up a system that creates a two tier system where it becomes increasingly difficult for marginalized, low income people to actually exercise their franchise, which would be a travesty. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256377">I do not think that is what anyone intended in this bill, at least I hope not. However, it will be up to us in committee to hear from experts, especially the lawyers who are very familiar, as are those in my community, with the statutory declaration process. They will be able to offer some insight into how this process works and may be able to tell us what we need to not only protect the system but protect people's right to vote.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256378">With those kinds of concerns and reservations that we have, we are prepared to see this bill go to committee where I hope we can sit down and work on some amendments to make sure people who legitimately have the right to vote are not disenfranchised. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="256379">Mr. Speaker, I have to admit that I gave a tiny shudder when the reference was made to the American parallel simply because, although things are far better and have been for a number of decades in the United States, there was a time when electoral laws in some states were designed for the purpose of selectively disenfranchising certain people. I always worry that someone will misunderstand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256380">I want to make it clear that the model that was used in designing the ID requirement was based on a precedent that is Canadian. It is the electoral law in Quebec and modifications were made to that law in 1999. In saying that, I think my hon. colleague who just spoke would agree that the logical thing to do in committee is to seek out information as to how well this has worked out in Quebec. My understanding is that it has been a positive experience in Quebec, but obviously we could summon, as witnesses, electoral officials from that province and enquire about problems that have occurred, and also advocates for the homeless. Obviously there are homelessness issues in some Quebec cities as well as there are in Vancouver and elsewhere. We could probably deal in a businesslike manner with that problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256381">One thought that I do have as well is that the fundamental problem, when it comes to homeless people voting, is in addition to the issue of identification, and that is the fact that one's identity is normally linked in the electoral rolls to an address. It seems to me that there is a general need anyway for us to work on those whose addresses have recently changed. Young people going off to school tend to fall into this category, as do homeless people, obviously. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256382">I think a good case can be made for enhanced enumerations shortly before an election in areas where there are high levels of homelessness. This is obviously easier with fixed date elections.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="256383">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the member's comments and I will respond to them as quickly as I can. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256384">In actual fact, my information is that the new language in the bill would bring our system federally in line with what we have in B.C. as well. Actually, under the B.C. system there are problems in terms of people without identification who vote. We can look at the Quebec system, but I know it is a problem. What we can do federally now cannot be done provincially in B.C. in terms of homeless people who are not on the list being able to vote if they do not have ID. That is something to pay attention to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256385">In terms of the address, I am not sure that it is so much of a problem. A change took place, I believe in the 2000 election, such that homeless persons actually could state that their address was the shelter where they resided. But the issue we are dealing with here is the actual ID that is required. The homeless may have an address that is a shelter or they may say it is located in a particular area. I am not sure that is so much the problem. It is not having the ID or a photograph ID that is the problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256386">I think there is an important issue about enumeration. If we had what we used to have, which was a full enumeration, we would not have this problem. I remember the days when enumerators went door to door and registered voters at the door. It was a very fine system. Now it is completely gone. I wish we could bring that back. I think it would be a lot more accessible and a lot more democratic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256387">We now have very limited enumeration, and again, I think it is a system that discriminates against people who do not own property, who do not necessarily fill out income tax forms every year, or who are not on the registered list, the permanent list. There are people who get disenfranchised as a result of the system we have. We have to pay attention to that. I believe it is very important. We will work very hard for amendments to make sure that there are not groups of people who are left out simply because they are poor or do not have the proper ID.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="256388">Mr. Speaker, I think my colleague and I have the same philosophy. We know that the Bloc Québécois is a staunch defender of Quebeckers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256389">In Quebec, voters commonly use identification in provincial and municipal elections. Of course, the bill that is before us can always be improved in committee. And that is what the Bloc Québécois proposes to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256390">My question for my colleague is simple. Does she recognize that it is time the federal government exercised better control over the voting process and used what is now in our power, that is, the identification required or provided by the provincial governments or, as the bill suggests, identification authorized by the chief electoral officer?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="256391">Mr. Speaker, there are some issues with the bill. The idea of a voter identification sounds very good, but the devil is in the details. To make sure it is equitable, we will have to look at its actual implementation and how it will affect different groups of people. That is our concern.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256392"> Whether or not it is in time for the next election, I do not know. I am not so concerned about that. I am concerned that we get this bill right if we are adopting a fairly major change. We have never had voter identification in our national elections so this is something quite substantially new. If we are going to do that, we have to do it properly. That is what we will be focusing on. I look forward to the Bloc assisting us with it to make sure that we are not leaving out people who otherwise will be forfeiting their right to vote.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="256393">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on Bill <Document DbId="2413948" Type="3">C-31, An Act to amend the Canada Elections Act and the Public Service Employment Act</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256394">I would like to begin my comments by quoting Alfred E. Smith, a very well-known governor of New York, a populist, a reformer in child labour and some other areas, and a solid advocate for the poor and for democracy. Many years ago, he said, “All the ills of democracy can be cured by more democracy”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256395">I agree with Mr. Smith. Those words are a prescription and should guide us in our deliberations. If, as some have claimed, there are ills in the system, the only way to cure the system is to open things up and have more democracy. I believe that what Mr. Smith was really referring to was the importance of opening up the process of government and of believing that democracy is not a static concept. In fact, democracy is fluid and evolves, and it can always be improved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256396">On the fundamental idea of improving the process of voting, or of democracy, let us make no mistake about it: my party and I support the concept and we believe that much more can be done to improve our system. To be clear, we support the principle and the spirit of Bill <Document DbId="2413948" Type="3">C-31</Document>. In fact, for many years we have called for improvements to the voting system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256397">But let me also be clear in saying that I have major problems with this bill. I believe it needs not just fine tuning but a major overhaul. To be clear, this bill is not the democratic remedy that will cure the body politic and what ails it right now. In fact, there is an argument to be made that the bill could make it worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256398">Let us examine the origins of this bill. I think that is important. The bill started with an examination by the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, just after the last election, on how to improve the integrity of the electoral system and the electoral process. In June 2006 the committee report was tabled. The government responded on October 20. The government then proposed this bill that is in front of us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256399">Just as a side comment on that, there is something that I find interesting. Yesterday the government said there was all party support for the report and there was a sense that we had a consensus on what is in the bill. We have to clarify that this was not the case. I think most people who were on the committee would acknowledge that. This bill and its contents are not what the committee asked for. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256400">In fact, there was a committee report and the government response to the report, and then, I would submit, there was cherry-picking in terms of what was in the report and what is in this bill. Those are the origins of the bill. I will be cautionary here. As I said, we support the spirit and the principle, but we are being cautionary because of the way in which the government has decided to improve the democratic process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256401">We have concerns about some of the points in the bill. As my colleague from Vancouver East has already mentioned, one of our concerns is about requiring people to have photo ID. This is possible disenfranchisement for some people. Not everyone has photo identification. Those on the government side will say, as others have said, that it is not a problem because they can then have someone vouch for them and they can swear an oath. There are problems with that. As my colleague said, the devil is in the details.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256402">There are many concerns around people's ability to find someone to vouch for them and concerns around having supports for that, be it because of language issues or lack of knowledge on how to have people to advocate for them. There may be unintended effects of this bill that would marginalize and shut out some of our most vulnerable citizens. I know that this is certainly not the intent of anyone in this House, but that unfortunately could be the outcome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256403">The way the bill is written might also leave it open to a charter challenge, for some of the reasons I have mentioned. Of course this is something that will come out in committee. It is very important to understand this. We saw, as was referred to by another member, that in the United States the electoral laws in the 1950s and 1960s were structured in a way that intended to disenfranchise people. It was part of the clarion call of the civil rights movement to change that in the United States.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="256404">I would hate to see unintended consequences that would do the same here. I do not think that is hyperbole. We have seen laws in this country that have done that. I refer to B.C. and its so-called section 80, whereby people were not able to get on the voters list until the actual day of the election simply because of a flawed enumeration system. It is important to acknowledge, with the way the bill is presently written, that a charter challenge could happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256405">It is also important to note that there are other ways to deal with the concerns MPs and people in general have with the integrity of the system. It is always important to note that when we have a piece of legislation in front of us we have to look at what the problem is. Here, the problem being put forward to us is that there is possible fraud occurring. How do we change that? The government is proposing a bill that talks about photo ID, vouching, swearing oaths, et cetera. Perhaps there are other ways and I think we have proposed some. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256406">One way to change that, as my colleague said, is a proper enumeration. We have just had two bills passed in Parliament that would affect enumeration and the electoral process. I am referring to the clauses in Bill <Document DbId="2158135" Type="3">C-2</Document> about the appointment of district returning officers based on merit. That is a good thing. My party supported it. We supported it before the election and we certainly supported it in Bill C-2.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256407">The bill now before us gives the district returning officer a new purview. The bill talks about who shall be given an oath and who shall be questioned, et cetera. We do not have the other piece in place, sadly, because of what is going on in the Senate. That process needs to happen. The Senate needs to pass the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256408"> Before that happens, I note that I have concerns about how these people will be trained and what merit we will be basing our decisions on. How are we going to train them so that the people we have employed are going to know the intricacies of their jobs? In this bill, we are giving them the authority to question people's legitimacy and whether they should be given a ballot or not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256409">Another concern of mine has to do with fixed date elections. Recently in this House in that regard I supported more resources being put into enumeration. That is what we heard about from witnesses who spoke on Bill <Document DbId="2221899" Type="3">C-16</Document>. I would like to see more emphasis put on a viable and sound enumeration process. That would be a better way of dealing with the problem, rather than simply asking for more ID, for referrals or for vouching for people when they might not have access to photo ID or to someone who could vouch for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256410">I believe the intent of the bill is important. Quite frankly, I believe the bill was rushed in the way it came from committee and has been put before the House. I think the bill needs an overhaul, not just fine tuning. We look forward to making major amendments to the bill when it comes to committee and we look forward to hearing from Canadians on how this will affect them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256411">My last point is that I began my comments by saying that the ills of democracy can be cured by more democracy, and if we are not careful, we will not be following that prescription. In fact, we will be doing the opposite with some of the unintended consequences of this bill.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="256412">Mr. Speaker, the member indicated that he was quite satisfied with the basic principles of the bill. He gave it approval in principle and said let us get it to committee to make these changes, but he also said that the bill needs a major overhaul. That may be a little bit of a contradiction in terms. Perhaps the example he has given may provide some questions for consideration, which I think is the purpose of getting bills to committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256413">The issue about disenfranchising people from almost anything to do with services that are available to people has come up often. Quite frankly, it surprises me, whether it is the federal government or the provincial governments, that government cannot come up with an arrangement for those who have no other access to photo ID, whether it be a driver's licence or some security card. It just seems to make so much sense in today's world where security issues are so important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256414">I would also remind the member, though, that I believe the bill also says that in lieu of the photo ID and someone vouching for the person, the Chief Electoral Officer also can designate that two other authorized pieces of non-photo ID would be required. I suspect that anyone, except maybe those living in a shelter, may have ready access to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256415">Does the member agree that we should try to address the global situation of how many people out there really cannot have reasonable access to photo ID that can be updated on an as needed basis? How many people are we talking about? Are the alternatives provided within the bill in fact sufficient?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="256416">Mr. Speaker, that is why I mentioned in my comments that enumeration seems to be the piece that should be focused on and it has not. Since we have had the centralized voter's list, it has been rife with problems. One of the problems is that we do not have that human contact when we go out and do the enumeration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256417">I am not happy with the provisions in the bill to designate to the district returning officer those kinds of responsibilities. As I mentioned, in Bill <Document DbId="2158135" Type="3">C-2</Document> we are looking at changing that role and having merit based appointments which we support. Until there is time to get people up and going and trained, I do not want to hand that over to people and set them up for something that might fail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256418">One comment that I did not have the time to make is my deep concern about the fact that we are going to have certain private information made public. That is the reference to birth dates. I understand the need for it, but to me this is a case of concerns about big government. That is something that the Privacy Commissioner might have concerns about. The bill talks about using income tax forms as a way in which we can verify information and use birth dates. That information would be given to candidates and to returning officers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256419">I think that is something that we should all be very concerned about. I am deeply concerned and I know other people will be.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="256421">In my riding the majority of constituents are renters. As such there is a very high turnover among those renters. We also unfortunately have a number of people who are homeless and who are struggling with mental health issues. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256422">In considering the high turnover, there are people who may not navigate systems as well as some of us do and many of whom may not be as engaged politically as we are without an enumeration system. They may not even be engaged in the voting system and may not vote at all. Given that one in every 200 Canadians is without a home, those Canadians may also be quite disengaged from the political process.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="256425">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak in support of Bill <Document DbId="2413948" Type="3">C-31</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256426"> This bill should be of interest to all members and all Canadians, because its goal is to improve the electoral process, the foundation of our democratic system. There can be no doubt that Canadian democracy is a great democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256427"> All members here have been through at least one election and know that the process is not perfect. They know that an election period lasts 36 days and is organized around a complex set of rules and procedures. They also know that holding general elections in 308 electoral districts is a major undertaking. In any operation of this scope there will always be room for improvement. Bill <Document DbId="2413948" Type="3">C-31</Document> will allow our electoral process to run more smoothly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256428"> At first glance, many changes seem to be somewhat technical, but even small operational modifications can produce concrete results in practice. Providing support for the machinery of democracy strengthens the integrity of the process as a whole.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256429"> I believe that the reforms should be greeted with the support and confidence of the candidates seeking election, the parties involved in the electoral process, the election officials responsible for the conduct of elections and, more particularly, the Canadian public, whose democratic choice is expressed through the electoral system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256430"> The bill contains tangible improvements for everyone involved in the democratic process. That is why I support it. I would like to briefly describe a few of the changes proposed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256431"> The most important change is that electors must identify themselves at the polling stations. As my colleagues from Quebec undoubtedly know, this measure has been in place in Quebec for the last seven years. Quebec’s Election Act was amended in 1999 to incorporate an obligation to present a piece of identification before voting. Other amendments also require that Quebecers identify themselves to vote in a referendum or municipal election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256432"> In order to exercise their right to vote in Quebec, electors must present a Quebec health insurance card, a driver’s licence, a Canadian passport, a certificate of Indian status or a Canadian Armed Forces card, and electors who cannot do that are referred to an identity verification panel and must sign a sworn statement as to their identity. They must produce at least two other documents to the panel that establish their identity or ask another elector who has an identity card with a photograph to be their guarantor.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256433"> Those measures are similar to what is proposed in Bill <Document DbId="2413948" Type="3">C-31</Document>. I am persuaded that the process for identifying electors will work as well at the federal level as it does in Quebec. A study done by the chief electoral officer of Quebec in 2002 shows that deputy returning officers and the persons responsible for polls are generally satisfied with this provision and that it has been relatively well received by electors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256434"> The deputy returning officers who took part in the study noted these facts: first, mandatory identification has strengthened the integrity of the voting process by reducing the possibility of fraud; second, this measure has led to increased public confidence in the system; and third, it enhances the importance of the voting process.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="256435"> I believe that Bill <Document DbId="2413948" Type="3">C-31</Document> will have the same good results, results that are really necessary at the federal level. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256436"> For example, members will recall an incident that was much talked about: an American student had voted in the 39th general election. His stated purpose was to demonstrate that the enforcement of rules at polling stations was too lax and that the opportunities for fraud were in his own words, “immense”. He succeeded. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256437"> However, I want to make it clear that the very great majority of voters go to the polls in good faith, solely to exercise their legitimate, democratic duty. It is almost impossible to prevent someone whose goal is to defraud the system from finding a way to do so. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256438"> Nevertheless, the provision dealing with voter identification in Bill <Document DbId="2413948" Type="3">C-31</Document> will make it a great deal more difficult for voters with unlawful intentions to achieve their goal. The bill includes mechanisms that will allow for an investigation after the election if necessary by requiring, for example, that voters without identification take an oath. The bill will highlight the rules for voters who may believe, incorrectly but in good faith, that they are eligible to vote. It will not prevent eligible voters from exercising their rights. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256439"> Most Canadians are used to presenting some form of identification for a variety of daily activities. Unlike other levels of Canadian government where identification is compulsory in order to vote, the bill provides alternative solutions for Canadian voters who do not have photo identification. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256440"> In other words, the bill establishes an important balance between accessibility and integrity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256441"> This bill introduces important changes that have been standard practice for a long time at other levels of government in Canada, like most of the reforms on election financing in Bill <Document DbId="2158135" Type="3">C-2</Document>. I think especially of the prohibition on donations from corporations and trade unions. The voter identification system works well in Quebec, and I am convinced that it will work well in the rest of Canada. <Document DbId="2158135" Type="3" /></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256442"> This bill contains numerous tangible improvements to the electoral process. I will mention only some of them. First, the voter’s date of birth will be added to the official and revised list of electors that will be used at polling stations. This measure is already in use in Quebec and represents another means of confirming the identity of a person who wishes to vote. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256443"> The Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs specifically requested in the recommendations on which these provisions are based that the elector’s date of birth not be shown on the lists given to candidates. I agree with that because it is very important to protect personal information. I see that the bill abides by this request. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256444"> I would like to highlight the fact that advance polling stations can henceforth be set up for a single polling division, instead of a minimum of two as is currently the case. This is an important change in those provinces and regions where the polling divisions are very far apart, in northern Canada, for example, or in highly rural areas. Now that the advance polling stations will be closer to the electors in these areas, it will be easier for them to exercise their right to vote. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256445"> Finally, I would like to point out that the bill contains various specific points on how the Chief Electoral Officer uses and communicates election information. For example, each registered elector will be assigned a unique, randomly generated identifier to facilitate the updating of the Register of Electors and improve its accuracy. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="256446"> In addition, income tax returns can be used to enhance the reliability of the information that Canadians agree to provide to Elections Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256447"> The bill also contains specific provisions on the exchange of election information between federal and provincial election authorities. This will help to improve the integrity of the federal and provincial voters’ lists and ensure that personal information is well protected. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256448"> I could go on much longer about the various advantages of this bill, but what is most important is the cumulative effect of all these improvements. These changes, taken together, enhance the integrity of our election process. Like the<Document DbId="2158135" Type="3"> Federal Accountability Act</Document> , this bill will help us maintain public confidence in our democratic system. Like Bill <Document DbId="2158135" Type="3">C-2</Document>, which deals with election financing in particular, this bill contains important reforms that have been tested in Quebec. Like Bill C-2, this bill, I hope, will be passed quickly by Parliament so that it will be in effect for the next election. These measures are important for all parties concerned and for all Canadians. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="256450">Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78942" Type="2">Yukon</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256451">The member for <Affiliation DbId="78620" Type="2">Lanark—Frontenac—Lennox and Addington</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="78922" Type="2">Ottawa Centre</Affiliation> went into great detail describing the bill and how we got from that place to here, so I will not repeat that, but I would like to highlight a few aspects that are important for us to consider as we deal further with this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256452">First of all, there was a report from the Chief Electoral Officer in September 2005 which set out a number of these improvements in the integrity of the electoral system. That report was considered by the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs last spring and a report was generated from that committee's hearings. That went to the government and on October 20 we received this report back from the government, incorporating most of the committee's recommendations as well as the drafted Bill <Document DbId="2413948" Type="3">C-31</Document> which we are considering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256453">I was not involved in that committee last fall, so I do not have the full history of what was suggested and what was rejected. However, it seems to me that it is a bit of a surprise at this stage, when we have gone through an iterative process with experts, party members, the Privacy Commissioner, the Chief Electoral Officer and other electoral officials, as well as debate in committee, and our own report going to the government and the government responding to it, that we are not a little further ahead than we appear to be now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256454">I listened carefully to the member for <Affiliation DbId="78973" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="78922" Type="2">Ottawa Centre</Affiliation>. While the points that they raise with respect to democratic access to the voting process make eminent good sense, and in fact they are fundamental principles that must be respected in a democracy, I am a little surprised that at this very late date in this process these are being raised as things that have been totally neglected by members from all parties, the government, electoral officials over the last period of longer than a year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256455">I am a little surprised at that. I thought actually there was an agreement that we would be moving this pretty quickly through at this stage. Having raised those concerns, it is incumbent upon us, of course, to consider that concerns they raise are either dealt with by amendment or that we are all given the assurances that they are properly looked after.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256456">As we look at election administration and this particular act amending the Elections Act, integrity of the voting system is absolutely critical. We have to balance two things. We have nothing if we do not have integrity of the system. We may have access to all sorts of people who may not otherwise have been enumerated or have easy access, but if we do not have the confidence of Canadians that the system as a whole has integrity, we have nothing. It simply is a chimera.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256457">How do we balance that integrity in ensuring that we have voter identification, that we have effective enumeration, as well as making access as easy as possible for those in society who do face various barriers? We have heard a number of examples of that, either people who are transient and do not have current local information to establish their residence and address, or people who indeed are homeless or living in shelters where they are living very restrictive lifestyles and have a very restricted ability to identify themselves or have someone vouch for their identification.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256458">That balance is tricky, I agree. We must ensure we get it right. I thought we were getting quite close there, but what needs to be done very quickly is to ensure that, first of all, the enumeration process is as sharp, as focused, as accurate, and as up to date as it possibly can be. I think this bill takes some steps toward doing that. There are many communities in our country which are remote and where there are really perennial problems with enumeration in those areas.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="20">(1620)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="256459">We have to, as a committee and as this House, give very strict directions to the Chief Electoral Officer and his staff to ensure that an extra effort is made to identify those areas of low enumeration. I think remote aboriginal communities are the best example of that where there have been in some communities over time a real under-enumeration. It is pretty obvious on the face of it, given what we know about the population and how many people are enumerated. That is an administrative factor. The bill is adequate for enumeration powers. We just have to ensure that the efforts are more strenuous in getting that enumeration done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256460">Another part, and it came up partly in the comments from the member for <Affiliation DbId="78973" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation>, is that we ensure that identification is as easy as possible. The bill lays out certain types of identification at different levels of challenge that can be used for the purpose of confirming identification. One thing that has not been specifically mentioned, which I think is very important, is that aboriginal band identification cards, which do have a photo and are issued by band councils, be accepted as government identification. This would be sufficient with the address and the photo. If they do not have the address, perhaps a letter from the band council would ensure that people in reserve communities have the full opportunity to vote.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256461">Focusing on careful enumeration in order to ensure that we have a secure but a broad interpretation, particularly in aboriginal communities, of the first line of identification with a photo on it that would be acceptable as government photo identification. It should go without saying. It is certainly in line with the whole recognition, under our Constitution and governments across this country, of the inherent right of self-government of aboriginal people and therefore that type of identification should be acceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256462">What we had better do, because of the concerns raised by members of the NDP, is get this back into committee after the vote as soon as possible, and get the necessary officials before us to ensure that the issues raised can be dealt with. At the end of the day, this will be a balance. We will not have enumerated every person eligible in this country. There will always be transients. There will always be difficulties that individuals have, but we must ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, we catch as many people while still securing the integrity of the system.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="256463">Mr. Speaker, I am happy to speak to Bill <Document DbId="2413948" Type="3">C-31</Document> on improving the election process. First, I basically agree with everything my colleague said. I would like to reinforce it, in the environment of my riding, with a bit of background.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256464">It is interesting that we are discussing this on the night after an American election. We saw the little pitfalls it ran into, which were related to computers. Improvements can always be made to the system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256465"> I think we have unanimous all party agreement that we want the highest integrity possible in the voter system. It is so important to our country. We want to ensure that as many people as possible are correctly enumerated so no thinks the elections are unfair. The type of indepth study into the bill is totally supported by all parties. We need to do as much as possible to ensure the integrity of the system for every one of our some 30 million Canadians, at least those who are of voting age.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256466">We have had some problems over the years in my riding, once again minor problems. Hopefully, administrative changes can fix these. With the new mailboxes, voter the cards mailed to people sometimes fall on the ground and other people pick them up and think they are supposed to vote. Sometimes they are mailed to the wrong address. Therefore, we have had a problem with all these cards floating around.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256467">Another problem, which we have had periodically, is the transient population in my riding. Some people move either in or out of the riding, or they move to other parts of the riding. There is a fair amount of movement throughout the riding. Although I am a big supporter of the permanent voters list, many times we would go door to door never knowing if we had the right number of voters. People had moved in, who were not on the list, or they had moved out, but they were still on the list. Hopefully, these amendments in the bill will help improve that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256468">In relation to the photo access card, I am not sure if pilot projects have been done or considered. However, we have to ensure the wrinkles are ironed out so everyone can have access to those cards, whether they are transient, or youth or aboriginal. Many youth in the country have no reason to have a photo ID card. When they need to get one early in their voting career, they have a hard time getting it. I also know there may be transient people who do not have a photo ID. We had a problem in my area when passports were becoming mandatory to get into the United States. Certain aboriginal people could not obtain a passport easily because they lived so far away. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256469">Hopefully, all these items will be facilitated by Elections Canada to ensure that everyone has easy access to the requirements needed to vote. They are not unreasonable requirements. They are in place in many other countries, as the study on the bill has shown. However, we always have to facilitate every person in our society, whether they are disabled, or a youth, or a senior or aboriginal, to ensure that new requirements are fair to everyone, that they can afford them and can obtain them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256470">I am adding my support to improving the integrity of the system. As I said, it is exciting coming after the eve of an American election, which turned out very well for my riding. A number of people have been elected who are against drilling in the Arctic National WildLife Refuge. The objective of all parties in Parliament is to ensure no drilling takes place in that area. I am excited for those who were elected, but I lament the loss of a few members who were also against drilling.</ParaText>

Perhaps we also need to ensure that people are voting in the right constituency. This is in part some of the intention.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="256474">Mr. Speaker, the question will give me a chance to address two things that I forgot to address. One is on the integrity, and I agree with the member. That is exactly the purpose of the bill. I had forgotten a particular example that I hope the committee will address at some time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256475">On election day I went to the hospital to visit some sick people. Lo and behold, a number of people there could not vote because they were visiting someone. One never knows when someone may have to go to emergency. They had driven 200 miles from their home to the hospital. They could not vote because they could not get to their polling station in time. This is a big flaw in the system and I hope we will look at this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256476">I am glad he asked the question about fixed elections dates. I did not have the chance to put something on the record. I do not think the amount of time that the election can be changed to avoid another election is big enough. The first day the bill comes into effect there will be only three days change from another election. There will be an overlap of another election within three days. It can only be changed to the day after the week after, and that is not enough. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256477">I know I have not convinced my colleagues in the House of that point, but someone said that in the long run I would be proved right. I suggest there be more flexibility to change the actual fixed election date so it avoids conflicting with another election.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="256491">Entitled, an act to amend the Judges Act and certain other acts in relation to the courts, Bill <Document DbId="2222191" Type="3">C-17</Document> proposes to amend the Judges Act to implement the government's response to the report of the 2003 Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission. The bill also proposes some technical amendments of a court related nature to other federal legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256492">Section 100 of the Constitution requires that Parliament and not the executive alone establish judicial compensation and benefits following full and public consideration and debate. In addition to the protections of section 100, the Supreme Court of Canada has established a constitutional requirement for an independent, objective and effective commission to make non-binding recommendations to government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256493">The government must publicly respond within a reasonable period of time to the commission report. Any rejection or modification of a commission recommendation must be publicly justified based on a standard of rationality. I will say something about this standard in a few moments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256494">The Judges Act was amended in 1998 to strengthen the existing commission process in keeping with the constitutional requirements identified by the Supreme Court of Canada. At the federal level, the Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission is the name of the independent, objective and effective commission that makes recommendations to the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256495">The commission convenes every four years to conduct an inquiry into the adequacy of judicial compensation and to deliver a report with its recommendations. The most recent commission completed its work when it delivered its report in May 2004. Sadly, implementation of the commission's recommendations languished under the former government. I will explain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256496">The commission fulfilled its role by conducting an inquiry and delivering a report with its recommendations. The former government responded to that report and introduced Bill <Document DbId="1784226" Type="3">C-51</Document> to implement its response. However, despite an introduction date of May 20, 2005, Bill <Document DbId="1784226" Type="3">C-51</Document> never proceeded beyond first reading and died on the order paper when the federal election was called in November 2005.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256497">When Canadians voted for change on January 23 of this year, they voted for a government that was willing to recognize its responsibilities, make the decisions that needed to be made and moved forward with implementing those decisions. This government believes strongly in the principle of judicial independence. One of my priorities upon assuming office of justice minister was to review the commission report. This government recognizes that the integrity of this entire process is dependent in part on timely passage of implementing legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256498">The government is firmly of the view that we had a responsibility to take the time to consider the report and recommendations in light of the mandate and priorities upon which we were elected. However, we undertook our review as quickly as reasonably possible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256499">This government provided its response to the commission report on May 29, 2006, followed almost immediately by the introduction of Bill <Document DbId="2222191" Type="3">C-17</Document> on May 31, 2006. The bill was referred after first reading to the committee on June 20. The Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights began its consideration of the bill on October 24 and tabled its report in the House on November 1, approving the bill with some minor technical amendments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256500">I am sure hon. members appreciate the critical importance of completing the final stage of the 2003 quadrennial cycle through the passage of legislation. The credibility, indeed, the legitimacy of this constitutional process requires it, especially since the next quadrennial commission process is due to commence in less than one year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256501">Bill <Document DbId="2222191" Type="3">C-17</Document> proposes to implement virtually all of the commission's recommendations. The exceptions are the commission's recommendation of a 10.8% salary increase and the representational costs proposal. Instead, the government is prepared to support a salary increase of 7.25% and to increase reimbursement of representational costs to 66% from the current level of 50%. The fully developed rationale for these modifications can be found in our government's response.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="256502">I know the hon. members have read the government's response, which fully explains the rationale for the modification of the commission's salary recommendations. I, therefore, intend to just briefly summarize our thinking on this important issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256503">Before doing so, however, I think it is important to speak to the standard of rationality against which any modification of the commission's recommendations by Parliament will be assessed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256504">It is necessary to displace some of the misconceptions that are at play in this area and, in particular, suggestions that respect for the constitutional judicial compensation process and for judicial independence, broadly speaking, can only be demonstrated through a verbatim implementation of commission recommendations. That is a clearly wrong interpretation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256505">To ensure public confidence in the process, I think it is absolutely critical that we have a shared appreciation and understanding of the very balanced guidance that has been provided by the Supreme Court of Canada in the key cases of the P.E.I. judges' reference case and the Bodner decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256506">In both decisions, the court has quite rightly acknowledged that allocations of public resources belongs to legislatures and to governments. A careful reading of both cases clearly indicates that governments are fully entitled to reject and modify commission recommendations, provided that a public, rational justification is given which demonstrates overall respect for the commission's process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256507">I would say here, as we did in the response, that the government is confident that we have fully met this requirement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256508">The effectiveness of the commission is not measured by whether all of its recommendations are implemented unchanged. It is measured by whether the commission process, its information gathering and analysis, and its report and recommendation played a central role in informing the ultimate determination of judicial compensation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256509">The commission's work and analysis have been critical in the government's deliberations, which is not critical of but critical in the government's deliberations. Our response respectfully acknowledges the commission's efforts and explains the government's position in relation to the two modifications to the commission's proposal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256510">In justifying our proposed modification of the salary recommendation, as reflected in Bill <Document DbId="2222191" Type="3">C-17</Document>, we gave careful consideration to all of the criteria established by the Judges Act and to two of these in particular: first, the prevailing economic conditions in Canada, including the cost of living and the overall economic and financial position of the federal government; and, second, the need to attract outstanding candidates to the judiciary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256511">With respect to the first of those, we concluded that the commission did not pay sufficient heed to the need to balance judicial compensation proposals within the overall context of economic pressures, fiscal priorities and competing demands on the public purse. In essence, the government ascribed a different weight than the commission to the importance of this criterion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256512">In terms of attracting outstanding candidates, we took issue with the weight that the commission placed on certain comparator groups against which the adequacy of judicial salaries should be assessed. The government recognizes that the task of establishing appropriate comparators for judges has been a perennial challenge for past commissions as well as parliamentarians given the unique nature of judicial office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256513">We acknowledge that the commission carefully and thoroughly considered a range of comparative information, including the incomes of senior public servants, governor in council appointees and private practice lawyers. Our key concern was the fact that the commission appeared to accord disproportionate weight to incomes earned by self-employed lawyers and, in particular, to those practitioners in Canada's eight largest urban centres. In addition, there was an apparent lack of emphasis given to the value of the judicial annuity.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="256514">As the response elaborates, the government believes that the commission's salary recommendation of 10.8% overshoots the mark in defining the level of salary increase necessary to ensure outstanding candidates for the judiciary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256515">The government is proposing a modified judicial salary proposal for puisne judges of $232,300, or 7.25%, effective April 1, 2004, with statutory indexing to continue effective April 1 in each of the following years, with proportionate adjustments for chief justices and justices of the Supreme Court of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256516">The one other proposed modification relates to the commission's recommendation that the judiciary be entitled to an increased level of reimbursements for costs incurred through the judges' participation before the commission. It recommended increases from 50% to 66% for legal fees and from 50% to 100% for disbursement costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256517">I note, as a matter of information, that disbursement costs in relation to the commission include, not just photocopying and courier services, but in particular, the cost of substantial contracts for the retention of expert compensation consultants and related matters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256518">In our view, reimbursement at 100% of disbursement costs would provide little or no financial incentive for the judiciary to incur costs prudently. Accordingly, Bill <Document DbId="2222191" Type="3">C-17</Document> would increase the current level of reimbursement for both legal fees and disbursements from the current 50% to 66%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256519">Our response also underscores that it will be parliamentarians, not this government, to decide which proposal to implement, be it that of the commission, the government or, indeed, a third proposal entirely. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256520">Bill <Document DbId="2222191" Type="3">C-17</Document> was carefully reviewed by the justice committee. The justice committee heard directly from the commissioners of the Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission. Representatives of the Canadian Bar Association also appeared before the committee, as did Professor Garant, to shed light on this constitutional process from the academic perspective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256521">Ultimately, the justice committee approved Bill <Document DbId="2222191" Type="3">C-17</Document> with some minor technical amendments. Despite an express invitation by the parliamentary secretary that any recommendation by the committee to amend the salary proposal would be seriously considered by the government, the committee did not include such a recommendation in its report but rather approved the bill on division.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256522">Accordingly, the time for this House to vote on the bill is drawing near. I would like, however, to ensure that the House is aware that Bill <Document DbId="2222191" Type="3">C-17</Document> also implements a number of other important compensation amendments. These amendments concern such matters as retirement eligibility, eligibility for supernumerary office and other minor changes to allowances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256523">Bill <Document DbId="2222191" Type="3">C-17</Document> also includes a long overdue proposal aimed at levelling the playing field for partners of judges in the difficult circumstances of relationship breakdown by facilitating the equitable sharing of the judicial annuity. The judicial annuity is currently the only federal pension that is not subject to such a division despite the fact that the judicial annuity represents a very significant family asset.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256524">The proposed annuity amendments essentially mirror the provisions of the federal Pension Benefits Division Act. Like that act, these provisions uphold the overarching principles of good pension division policy allowing couples to achieve a clean break, certainty and portability. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256525">These provisions are also consistent with both the objectives of probative retirement planning and the constitutional requirement of financial security as part of the guarantees of judicial independence. While on its face, extremely complicated, the policy objective of this mechanism is very simple. It is to address a long outstanding equity issue in support of families undergoing breakdown of the spousal relationship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256526">I will wrap up and hand Bill <Document DbId="2222191" Type="3">C-17</Document> over to the House for debate. I invite all parliamentarians to carefully discharge their important responsibility in light of the governing constitutional and statutory principles. In doing so, the members of the House will help ensure that Canada continues to have a judiciary whose independence, impartiality, commitment and overall excellence not only inspires the confidence of the Canadian public but is envied around the world.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="256532">Mr. Speaker, I am going to ask the Minister of Justice to comment on the rationale for the government's response. He knows that it is absolutely essential to have independent judiciary. He knows that this commission which recommended over 10% was independent. He breached that independence when he introduced Bill <Document DbId="2222191" Type="3">C-17</Document>, which talks of a lower percentage.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="256534">Mr. Speaker, the member speaks about a principle being older than the Magna Carta. In fact, the independence of the judiciary is not a principle that is older than the Magna Carta. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256535">The Magna Carta is actually an excellent place to start. Section 100 of the Constitution Act says that Parliament makes the determination on public expenditures. That is, in fact, what the Magna Carta is all about. Section 100 deals exactly with the Magna Carta and the responsibility of Parliament to deal with the issue. The Supreme Court of Canada in two cases, the P.E.I. reference case and the Bodner case, recognized the paramountcy of Parliament in determining that issue on a standard of public rationality. It is for Parliament to make that determination. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256536">Thirteen billion dollars is the number that my colleague has been pointing out. The priority of this government and this Parliament was to pay down the debt. That is the priority of this government. The allocation of that money obviously has to be weighed against all of the other issues that we need to deal with as a government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256537">I understand the member does not think that paying down the debt is important, but it happens to save Canadian taxpayers $650 million each and every year. This was not simply a matter of shifting the books as the Liberals did with the employee pension case, just shifting numbers around to create so-called surpluses. This was actual money used to pay down the debt.</ParaText>

It is a constitutional responsibility that the government has.

The principle of the independence of the judiciary is ingrained in the Constitution and is a foundation of our society. How could anyone believe that someone who pays them and changes their salary would not have an effect on their decisions? That is why the commission was set up, so that there would be good solid reasons. </ParaText>

It is my pleasure to give the opposition response to this bill going to third reading. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256550">The bill deals with judicial salaries and allowances, judicial annuities and other benefits. Bill <Document DbId="2222191" Type="3">C-17</Document>, to put it in its historical context, is the second government response to the 2003 Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission. The previous government had introduced Bill <Document DbId="1784226" Type="3">C-51</Document> on the same subject. Historical context is very important because the people of Canada can see that action was undertaken by all governments with respect to this stagnant file.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256551"> As usual, Bill <Document DbId="1784226" Type="3">C-51</Document>, the predecessor legislation brought in under a Liberal government, was far more comprehensive and far more meaningful. It proposed a whole bunch of items that dealt with more than just the strict recommendations of the commission. There were a number of court related reforms, including the expansion of the unified family courts across this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256552"> In my own province of New Brunswick, there is a serious backlog of Family Court cases. Bill <Document DbId="2222191" Type="3">C-17</Document> did not deal with this issue. I know the member for <Affiliation DbId="78906" Type="2">Tobique—Mactaquac</Affiliation> would be interested to know that there are women waiting in all judicial districts of New Brunswick for dates for hearings before justices of the Family Court to deal with serious issues of child custody and the making of payments for support and maintenance. These are very serious matters. These matters touch everyone in the country. I thought it was important to underline that they hit home; they hit New Brunswick. The paucity of regulations in Bill <Document DbId="2222191" Type="3">C-17</Document> as opposed to Bill <Document DbId="1784226" Type="3">C-51</Document> just show how the government is not concerned with holistic or wholesome justice reforms, but just piecemeal ones.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256553">Sadly, Bill <Document DbId="1784226" Type="3">C-51</Document> did not proceed beyond first reading. It died on the order paper with the dissolution of the last Parliament.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="256554"> In the reference case, the Supreme Court of Canada also concluded that government delays in responding to the reports of judicial compensation commissions can damage judges’ morale. It could even cast doubt on the independence of the judiciary. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="256555">Indeed, the independence of our judiciary is very much at stake in this bill as presented. Many times courts and commissions have established how critical the financial security of judges is, not only for maintaining judicial independence and impartiality, but also for attracting persons most suited by their experience and ability to be excellent candidates for the bench. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256556">There seems to be a general attack on the judiciary presented by the government in its totality of justice bills. When we combine the effects of Bill <Document DbId="2222191" Type="3">C-17</Document>, which strikes at the heart of judicial independence, with the effects of Bill <Document DbId="2172003" Type="3">C-9</Document> on conditional sentences, which is taking away the discretion of judges, and when we even combine it with the process involving the approval of Justice Rothstein to the Supreme Court of Canada, although it met with great success in that instance, it still puts the independence of the judiciary in question. It is as if the government has something in its craw about judges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256557">The bill completes the picture in striking at the heart of the independent findings of the commission. The report of the commission, and that was the McLennan commission, recommended that federally appointed judges receive a 10.8% salary increase effective April 1, 2004. As we know, Bill <Document DbId="2222191" Type="3">C-17</Document> proposes an increase of 7.25% as of the same date, April 1, 2004, so where does the difference come from?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256558">The commission reviewed Canada's economic situation. I was curious to note that the minister pretended as if the commission did not review the economic conditions prevailing in society. He would therefore lead us to infer that the commission irresponsibly would avoid looking at the economic conditions pertaining in this country and still recommend a salary increase.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256559"> Of course it looked at our economic conditions, and thanks to the great economic stewardship over the past decade or more of the member for <Affiliation DbId="78571" Type="2">LaSalle—Émard</Affiliation>, this country has an enviable economic situation. For the minister to say that this was not considered sufficiently by the commission is in fact wrong. It is wrong in fact and it is wrong in opinion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256560"> Canadians can see through this. They can see that this agenda of law and order also means that judges should do as the government feels they should. They should not be independent. They should be tethered to the purse of the government and its agenda with respect to justice issues. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256561">Instead of simply establishing whether the government had sufficient funds to comply with the salary recommendation of the independent commission, the government believes that consideration also should be given to the other economic and social priorities of the government. It is curious to note that it is not the economic and social priorities of the community, but of the government, for on the same day that the Conservatives received news of a $13.2 billion surplus, they announced cuts of over $1 billion, hurting the most disadvantaged and helpless people in the community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256562">Does this mean that federal judges' salaries and, most important, their independence, is not a priority for the current government? Clearly Canadians are smart enough to draw that assumption from the government's actions. It is not important that judges be independent, the government says, so it will cut their salaries. It will also find judges whose beliefs the government believes in and put them on the court.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256563">After cutting a billion dollars in social programs on the same day they received the news of the $13 billion-plus surplus, how can the Conservative government argue that it is refusing the conclusions and recommendations of the independent McLennan commission in this context? Is the minority government once again putting its own partisan agenda before the needs and the greater good of Canada? Are the Conservatives once again leaving Canadians behind in favour of their own political agenda?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256564"> I am not the only one questioning the government decision to come up with another number for the judges' salaries. The Canadian Superior Court Judges Association is also concerned by the rejection of the independent commission's salary recommendations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256565">I know that the member for <Affiliation DbId="78377" Type="2">Nepean—Carleton</Affiliation> will be very interested in the accountability aspects of the bill. Having sat with that member for Nepean—Carleton in the hearings for Bill <Document DbId="2158135" Type="3">C-2</Document> in the legislative committee last spring, I know he is keenly interested in the issues of accountability. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="256566">How accountable is it that the recommendation emanating from the independent commission, the independent judges salary commission--and members of the House will know that Bill <Document DbId="2158135" Type="3">C-2</Document> is replete with the word independent--was rejected by the government? How accountable is that? I can only echo the concerns of the Canadian Superior Court Judges Association. It seems to me that we would have to go a long way in the history of this country to see political activism from our judiciary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256567"> I echo those concerns. I am troubled by what seems to be the government picking up another salary figure and justifying it by criticizing the independent commission for not having accepted its arguments in the first place. It is as if the Conservatives should have picked Gwyn Morgan or some other Tory contributor to sit on the commission so they could have had the results they wanted. That, in their minds, would have closed the accountability loop.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256568">Once again, this is a narrow approach that we have heard a lot about in recent years from our southern and formerly governing Republican neighbours, who say, “If you're not with us, you're against us”. The government seems to reject the independence of a commission. Those members in fact reject the good judgment of our judges and they are piercing a sword in the very muscle of judicial integrity and independence in this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256569">Canada does not work like that. Canadians do not like that kind of play. They like fair play. Bill <Document DbId="2222191" Type="3">C-17</Document> is not about being for or against the commission recommendations per se. It is about independence and accountability and the impartiality of our judges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256570"> Judges interact with the citizens of Canada, both victims and criminals, with people in the judicial system. They must be above reproach from any political incursion. They must be independent. They must have integrity. Above all, they must have the respect of all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256571"> How are we to respect a government that does not respect the fact that people in Canada want their judges to be above politics and not to be besmirched by any cheap political process, which this non-accountability act compliant provision provides?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256572">It is all about doing what we can to maintain the highest standard of judicial independence. We cannot jeopardize judicial independence in our system, the system that is from the common law that pertains throughout many countries in the world, and we cannot do it, foremost, to promote a partisan agenda. This is not acceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256573"> Having said that, I will say that this bill going to third reading has some good aspects, as Bill <Document DbId="1784226" Type="3">C-51</Document> did, aspects that the Canadian people should know about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256574">On the issues with respect to northern removal, my friend, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78942" Type="2">Yukon</Affiliation>, will be interested to know that northern removal as it is defined in the bill has a bit of a negative connotation. It sounds like people are moving from the north and is something like how the member for <Affiliation DbId="78930" Type="2">Fort McMurray—Athabasca</Affiliation> wants Maritimers to move out west as part of a migration program from the government. It does not mean that at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256575"> What it really means is that justice will be done in the northern communities of this country. We often say from sea to sea to sea, and many Canadians who live in the south do not understand the concept of that third sea, but up near that third sea, as the member for<Affiliation DbId="78942" Type="2">Yukon</Affiliation> will know, serving as he does on the justice committee, delivering justice to the citizens of our great northern territories is often difficult. As such, the northern removal procedures set out in Bill <Document DbId="1784226" Type="3">C-51</Document> and now carried through with Bill <Document DbId="2222191" Type="3">C-17</Document> will do a great deal to improve the quality of justice in the northern parts of our community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256576">The supernumerary provisions, the rule of 80 provisions, will allow for a much more flexible system of judicial personnel appointments throughout many of our provinces. It will allow judges who have earned the combination of years of service and age to go to supernumerary status and be available essentially as part time judges to serve the provinces in which they reside. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256577">This may do something to make up for the government's glaring error in not following the script of Bill <Document DbId="1784226" Type="3">C-51</Document> in appointing a unified family court, particularly in provinces that do not have a unified family court such as New Brunswick, and we hope it does. On this side, we trust the chief justices of this province to manage their courts properly. We give them the respect they are due and hope that this bill aids them in that process.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="256578">I leave members with these thoughts about the application of this act and others with respect to judicial remuneration and judicial vacancies. It is to be hoped that we can move forward in the House in a non-partisan way, realizing that the judiciary should be above all aspects of partisanship. The judiciary, when appointed, should be on a pedestal. The judiciary should be above the concerns that often occur in this place and, above all, the judiciary should be respected by the Canadian public. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256579">The Canadian public wants a judiciary that metes out justice and settles the disputes in our communities that happen from time to time in a way that is beyond reproach. It is to be hoped, with the beginning of new negotiations involving the same commission, that the next government, which I sincerely hope for the sake of all Canadians will not be a government made up of people from that side, will respect the principles of judicial independence and the integrity of our judges and adopt the recommendations when they come forward from the next quadrennial Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="256617"> There are three extremely important principles concerning the judiciary: judges must be independent, that is to say free from any partisan interference; judges must be well paid to avoid any inclination to corruption where they might be tempted to do anything other than their duties as magistrates; and judges must be irremovable, except for misconduct, in which case a mechanism for dismissal involving both houses is provided. From 1999 to 2003, judges and members of Parliament were linked by a common mechanism for salary adjustment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256618"> The problem with this bill, is that the previous Prime Minister, the member for LaSalle—Émard, abandoned that principle and established a very unfortunate precedent. That is repeated in this bill, so much so that if the bill were adopted, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court would have a higher salary than the Prime Minister. With all due respect for the judiciary, there is a principle of democratic legitimacy which holds that the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, deserving as she might be, should never have a higher salary than the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="256651">Mr. Speaker, Bill <Document DbId="2168485" Type="4">C-285</Document> seeks to require CMHC to transfer funds from its reserve to provincial governments. There is no question that the objective of the bill is laudable in the sense that it encourages social housing. This is something that is already being done by this government and the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256652"> However, a simple mechanical formula, as that expressed in Bill <Document DbId="2168485" Type="4">C-285</Document>, is in isolation and without regard to all of the factors that must be taken into consideration and without regard to all the players involved in Canada's housing system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256653">Canada's housing system involves many players working together to help meet the housing needs of Canadians. The federal government itself, through the auspices of CMHC, is a key player in the system, providing funding and working to promote partnerships that will increase the supply of affordable housing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256654">Additionally, the federal government helps maintain the existing housing stock and supports research that helps identify new ways to ensure the housing and support requirements of those in need are met.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256655">However, the government does not act in isolation. Provincial governments play a pivotal role in providing housing, funds for housing and support services. Furthermore, municipal governments, community associations and others help with the on the ground delivery and management of housing and associated services. Working with these partnerships is at the core of CMHC's mandate. Through active involvement with partners and stakeholders, CMHC has been serving Canadians for the past 60 years. Beginning in 1946, CMHC was given the job of helping to house more than one million returning war veterans and to lead Canada's national housing programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256656">There is also another function of CMHC and that is the insurance and securitization component. In that respect, it is meant to be a commercial enterprise that operates in the private market with others that provide mortgage insurance. With respect to the introduction of mortgage insurance by CMHC relating to building or house loans, it operates as a business, a business that earns its income from insurance premiums and fees but at rates that are competitive with and on a level playing field with other business enterprises offering a similar service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256657">This bill essentially requires, in accordance with an inflexible formula, the transferring of CMHC's mortgage insurance profits to the provinces for social housing purposes. This initiative would not require further parliamentary debate or approval where all parliamentarians would have the opportunity to examine and put the initiatives to the test. It plans to have an arbitrary formula based on specific percentages without regard to those items that might essentially cause a need to have a greater reserve. The bill proposes to have the transfer made automatically without any parliamentary consultation whatsoever. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256658">The clause, as it now reads, intends to amend section 29 that establishes a reserve fund. It states that moneys get placed to a reserve fund after taking into account a series of events like bad debts, depreciation and anticipated future losses. I find that some of those are calculable but the anticipated futures losses are dependent, in a large part, on the economy, on interest rates and a whole series of factors. To arbitrarily fix it at a specific rate, as being proposed in this bill, does not bear relationship to those factors and certainly is not something I could support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256659">While CMHC is not a private insurer, it is subject to the same risks and follows the same guidelines set by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions for capitalization for prudent management and in order to maintain a level playing field with private mortgage insurers. The reserves required by the OSFI serve to protect the Canadian taxpayer from potential future costs arising from mortgage defaults. If, indeed, the interest rates were to go up substantially, there would be a significant claim on the reserve fund. If that fund were transferred out according to an arbitrary formula and without regard to potential loss, it could have significant effects on the Canadian taxpayer because, in the end, it is the Government of Canada that guarantees the due performance of the mortgages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256660">In order for CMHC to be competitive with other institutions that are operated privately to provide the same services, it needs to establish a reserve to properly capitalize its assets to ensure that if there is an economic downturn it can cover those losses.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="45">(1845)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="256661">Currently, to purchase a home in a low equity ratio of say 95% or 5%, those loans are insured by CMHC, which is backed by the Government of Canada that has a stake in this matter. It can provide housing to first time homebuyers at a very low down payment of 5% in this case and interest rates that generally would not be available unless one had a 25% down payment. This insurance is financed by premiums that go into the CMHC revenues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256662">Without a doubt, the CMHC plays a distinctive role in our housing system and delivers substantial benefits to Canadians. For example, CMHC mortgage insurance has helped one in three Canadian families buy a home of their own with as little as 5% down and at interest rates comparable to those for homebuyers with a down payment of 25% or more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256663">I have less difficulty with the objects of the use of the funds proposed to be transferred from CMHC than the formula suggested to raise those funds. Those objectives are: first, for social and affordable housing purposes; second, to encourage a supply of quality housing at affordable prices; third, to increase housing choices for the people in the provinces; and finally, to contribute to the creation and development of housing cooperatives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256664">It is also important to recall that the government is already taking action in all of the four aforementioned areas. For example, through CMHC, the federal government has demonstrated its commitment to social and affordable housing by spending $2 billion annually, primarily in support of some 633,000 households.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256665">In addition, a major component of CMHC's assisted housing efforts are directed toward Canada's aboriginal population, both on and off reserve. CMHC provides funding for specialized housing construction and renovation programs, capacity development and ongoing subsidies for existing portfolio of assisted housing on reserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256666">Moreover, we are encouraging the supply of quality housing at affordable prices. For example, we are moving ahead with the $1 billion affordable housing initiative and working with provincial, territorial and other stakeholders to deliver affordable housing for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256667">More broadly, the one percentage point reduction of the goods and services tax is helping Canadians by making housing more affordable. As well, the budget includes a provision for a strategic investment of as much as $1.4 billion to establish three housing trusts. These trusts will focus on affordable housing, northern housing and housing for aboriginal people living off reserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256668">Likewise, we are also working to increase housing choices. Funding for CMHC's residential rehabilitation assistance program, commonly referred to as RRAP, and several related housing, renovation and adaptation programs has been extended for 2006-07 at a cost of $128 million. RRAP provides financial assistance to repair homes occupied by low income people. This program is also used to create housing by converting non-residential buildings into residential use.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256669">We are also providing resources for cooperative housing. Across Canada, where CMHC administers, there are about 53,000 households living in some 2,000 non-profit housing co-ops currently in operation. In addition, where CMHC administers on behalf of the federal government, CMHC will provide some $100 million in 2006 to federal cooperatives under various programs. This is how it should work, where parliamentary appropriations address the needs envisioned by the objectives outlined.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256670">However, the proposal to use profits in a mortgage insurance business for social housing purposes means essentially that the premiums are, in effect, being used for social objectives and are, in effect, being funded by individual homebuyers as opposed to the Government of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256671">Bill <Document DbId="2168485" Type="4">C-285</Document> would lock the government and Parliament into a very rigid formula that would circumvent, not only Parliament's direction but also do it at the expense of first time homebuyers and those purchasing mortgage insurance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256672">It is for these reasons that I cannot support the bill. We cannot use moneys collected from premiums made by first time homebuyers and use those funds for social housing objectives or any other objectives for that matter. Those types of objectives should be made by Parliament and by appropriation from this House where everyone has an opportunity to contribute to the process and actually have a vote because in the end it is the taxpayer that is responsible.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="256673">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in this debate on private member's Bill <Document DbId="2168485" Type="4">C-285</Document>, an act to amend the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act related to the distribution of profits to the provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256674">I think the bill, in terms of its intent, is a laudable goal. In fact, it certainly covers some of the objectives which a number of other programs within the Government of Canada already share.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256675">The bill basically calls for the distribution of profits from CMHC, being a crown corporation, and the appropriation of the profits and the reserves from the crown corporation would be distributed to the provinces on a per capita basis. The bill provides for somewhat of a formula for doing this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256676">Ultimately, the objective of the bill is to provide for social and affordable housing purposes, to encourage the supply of quality housing at affordable prices, to increase housing choices for the people in the provinces and to contribute to the creation and development of housing co-operatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256677">Prior to becoming a member of Parliament, I had the opportunity to serve on the board of the Peel Regional Housing Authority. It was a jointly funded housing authority with the Province of Ontario in cooperation with the region of Peel and Peel non-profit, which is the region's own not for profit housing service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256678">The Peel Regional Housing Authority took care of some 2,000 housing units. Half of them were senior units, who usually paid their rent on time, and the units were well kept. The other half were family units, 75% of which were lone parent situations, mother-led families usually, often with financial difficulties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256679">It is an extremely difficult job to be in the social or so-called affordable housing business. It takes the collaboration of not only the municipalities, the regions and the provinces, but also the federal government. A number of initiatives have evolved over the years to ensure that some of these objectives are being appropriately dealt with, whether it be rent geared to income arrangements or rent supplement where people are permitted to pay what they can afford, and it deals with developers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256680">Housing is not solely a federal responsibility. Social housing is a provincial responsibility and that has been seconded to the regional level of government. I know that our offices often deal with these situations. People who have the pressures of the demands for affordable housing invariably have other problems that they have to deal with. It may be children's issues or personal financial issues and people are looking for some advocacy by their member of Parliament to help them out of a difficult situation. Many times they have other social situations and disabilities within their children. It is probably one of the toughest areas, I must admit, that has been prevalent in my work as a member of Parliament over some 13 years, and I have tried to be sensitive to the needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256681">This particular bill is sensitive to those needs and seeks to look to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, which is a crown corporation, but is also a commercial business. It has reserve requirements based on its housing stock and on capitalization needs. There are established financial standards within the office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions. It operates within the guidelines provided to it to ensure there is proper coverage for its portfolio and for its exposures and liabilities, and it must be competitive. When we think about it, some $2 billion is being made available for the purpose of achieving its overall objectives. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="55">(1855)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="256682">In just a general sense, CMHC, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, lends money to individuals who do not have enough money for down payments. It offers, for an additional cost, mortgage loan insurance which enables people to buy houses. Potential buyers, who only have 5% of the capital needed to buy a house, can receive a mortgage loan from CMHC in addition to the mortgage loan they receive from the bank. As we can see, a significant role is being played.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256683">There is another aspect to the bill, or that is related to the bill, that must also be taken into account. It has to do with a term that we have discussed quite a bit in this Parliament and that is accountability. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256684">The profitability or the operational income or loss of any crown corporation is consolidated into the consolidated revenue fund. In fact, the financial position and performance, the surplus or deficit for a year, of the Government of Canada on an annual basis includes the operations of these crown corporations to the extent that there are prior year surpluses that have been accumulated to provide the financial protection for the exposure that CMHC has made. These have already been accounted for. To the extent that we take these profits out, one of the things that it will do on an annual basis is actually, on a comparative basis, reduce the surplus or increase the deficit of the government's financial position, simply because prior years had the profitability from this commercial venture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256685">The other issue is that the bill seeks to have this money simply transferred to the provinces, effectively on a per capita basis. If we were to do that, we would be dealing with matters which relate, not only to equalization but also to program funding, which we have. It means that cash, over and above which has been agreed upon by the provinces, would now be appropriated to the provinces. However, once the federal government loses that or delivers the money, we do not have a string to say that the money is there for this purpose and it should be used for that purpose. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256686">However, what if it is not? What if we do not achieve our objectives? How does the federal government that taxes Canadians to achieve the revenue requirements to support programs and operate crown corporations, to run viable commercial ventures in areas where Canadians need support, and to make a reasonable profit competitive with the industry in which they are participating, take those moneys, which belong to Canadian taxpayers and transfer it to the provinces and not have some sort of accountability? The bill does not provide for that accountability and it is probably one of the biggest flaws of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256687"> It is not good enough for any level of government to collect money basically from its constituents, its taxpayers, and to use that money to give to someone else for whatever purpose without having those rigours.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256688">Crown corporations are subject to review and audit by the Auditor General. If those funds are being transferred, the operation and use of those funds would be outside of the purview of the Auditor General. We would not even have a mechanism to ensure that the funds were properly safeguarded and used for the purpose for which they were intended.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256689">As we can see, in general I am sure that all hon. members will agree that the spirit of the member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="2168485" Type="4">C-285</Document>, is certainly laudable. It is certainly an objective of all Canadians to ensure that affordable housing is in reasonable supply for those who need it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256690">Social housing is a slightly different issue because now we are talking about those who are unable to have housing. They would be on the streets otherwise and these are generally outside the purview of the Government of Canada in its role as it works. To suggest that this is dealing with both social and affordable housing issues would tend to provide an intrusion of the Government of Canada into provincial jurisdictions. This raises yet another issue and certainly there has to be respect. The Constitution provides for the constitutional responsibilities that have been assigned to the provinces.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="00">(1900)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="256691">Having said all that, I want to congratulate the member on raising an important issue about the need to be sensitive to the needs of Canadians with regard to affordable social housing, but unfortunately, this bill is perhaps not the instrument we need to enhance that objective.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="256692">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise this evening in support of Bill <Document DbId="2168485" Type="4">C-285</Document>, an act to amend the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act. We believe this bill will help alleviate the housing burden placed on people, not only in my riding but right across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256693"> The bill would have CMHC profits that exceed 0.5% distributed to the provinces for social and affordable housing, to encourage the supply of quality housing at affordable prices, to increase housing choices for people, and for the creation and development of housing co-operatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256694">In the city of Toronto, where I come from, there are about 65,000 households on a waiting list for assisted housing. It can take up to 12 years for a family on the list to get a three bedroom apartment. Housing is clearly in crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256695"> In my own riding of Parkdale—High Park, a mere 12 affordable homes have been completed since 2001, according to a June 2006 report from the City of Toronto's Shelter, Support and Housing Administration, and another 21 are under development. But this is a riding where there are more than 24,000 people living below the poverty line and more than 10,000 very low income households, that is, households with annual incomes below $20,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256696">These very low income households can afford a rent of about $500 a month based on the standard calculation that they should spend no more than 30% of their annual income on shelter. The average market rent in my riding of Parkdale—High Park for a typical two bedroom apartment is $1,085. This is double what the poorest households can actually afford.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256697">The real culprits behind this crisis are the federal and provincial governments, which have cut funding and then downloaded housing responsibilities. The federal government cut new affordable housing funding in 1993 and Ontario followed in 1995. The federal government downloaded most federal housing programs to the provinces and territories in 1996, and Ontario followed in 1998 by downloading to the municipalities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256698">As homelessness and housing insecurity have grown following the housing cuts, governments have tried to respond with a patchwork of funding and programs, but the federal homelessness programs are due to sunset at the end of fiscal year 2006. Literally thousands of services that provide critical relief to tens of thousands of homeless people are at risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256699">The federal government recently allocated $1.4 billion of the $1.6 billion in housing funding from Bill <Document DbId="1815922" Type="3">C-48</Document>, which was a result of the NDP's amendment to the last Liberal budget, passed in 2005, but that is nothing more than a down payment set against years of cuts, downloading and neglect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256700">There are some people in this country who are now recognizing that we have a housing crisis even in the province of Alberta. Retiring Alberta Premier Ralph Klein announced Tuesday that he would allocate $16 million for new affordable housing in Calgary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256701"> He stated this week that the struggle of the homeless and working poor in places like Calgary and Fort McMurray is unfortunately more of a challenge today than ever. He said it is a great concern to see that half of Calgarians who are homeless right now have a job and are simply not making enough money to afford appropriate accommodation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256702"> I should say that I have introduced a federal bill to increase the minimum wage to $10 an hour, which would also help people who fall under federal jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256703"> Mr. Klein at least is doing a little. It is very late, but it is great to see that at least one Conservative is finally starting to get it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256704">We need now to deal with homelessness and housing insecurity. We need to make sure that the levels of government that have the funds to deal with housing are putting money into housing. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="05">(1905)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="256705">In May 2006 a United Nations committee of experts in Geneva released its latest review of Canada's compliance with international economic, social and cultural rights and called homelessness and affordable housing a crisis in Canada that is a national emergency. I certainly agree with that assessment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256706">I want to emphasize the importance of this bill, especially in light of the Conservative government's cuts to housing funding and affordable housing in general.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256707">It is my grave concern that the money that could come as a result of this private member's bill may not amount to much because the recent changes to mortgage insurance, which opens up mortgage insurance to the market, will negatively affect the profits of CMHC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256708">CMHC insurance is important to people who cannot afford a full down payment on a home, but still want to have the opportunity to purchase a home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256709">Mortgage insurance is a good business for the government to be in. It generates money. In 2005 the net income from mortgage insurance for CMHC was nearly $1 billion. As a crown corporation, CMHC must be concerned about profits, but since the shareholder is the Government of Canada, it has the ability to address the welfare of Canadians instead of just the bottom line.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256710">Assuming the goal is not to have CMHC removed from mortgage insurance altogether, it is very likely that new competitors will take the more profitable and stable contracts, leaving CMHC with only the higher risk and less profitable ones. This would put housing insurance at risk for lower income families as CMHC would have fewer funds to access. Any hopes that profits from CMHC mortgage insurance could be used to create affordable housing in Canada would then be greatly reduced or eliminated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256711">The real solution here is that we need a national housing strategy that needs all levels of government to make significant investments in affordable, supportive and co-op housing. This bill does not solve all of those problems. We do have a national crisis, a national emergency, in affordable housing in this country, but we believe that this bill is one positive step and that is why we support it.</ParaText>

The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation must respect its mission, which is to help Quebeckers and Canadians purchase safe, affordable, quality housing, as mentioned in the activity report. To do so, the corporation must first stop accumulating its undistributed profits and setting them aside for capitalization. That is the crux of the matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256713"> I was talking with my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78337" Type="2">Vaudreuil-Soulanges</Affiliation> and she told me that ordinarily in her riding there is always an accumulation of 30% that is kept with a view to a second phase for housing. There are now accumulations of 75% because this money cannot be used to carry out a second phase. It is actually kept and controlled by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation and consequently transferred to capitalization. This is not the role of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. Its mission is clearly defined. Its primary role is to provide affordable housing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256714"> For example, in the riding I was talking about a while ago, housing is required so that workers can live near their work. In that region, the cost of a house or a condo is so high that workers cannot afford them. In such places, the search for skilled middle-class workers is difficult for these companies because there is no easy access to housing. This is the problem the Bloc wants to fix. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256715"> First, the corporation must stop accumulating these undistributed profits for capitalization, as it has been doing since 1998, and promote investments in social community, and affordable housing. These surpluses now account for $5.3 billion. The needs are obvious, in both Quebec and the rest of Canada. In Quebec, there are 450,000 households with pressing housing needs, while for Canada as a whole, there are 1.7 million such households.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256716"> The Bloc is calling for negotiations to resume for the compete transfer of responsibility and funds for housing, because, as it correctly says, this is a matter under provincial jurisdiction, and this transfer must take place as soon as possible and as smoothly as possible so that Quebec and all of the provinces are able to direct the construction of this housing, making sure that the cost associated with renewing the housing stock is included. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256717"> The purpose of this bill is therefore to limit the capitalization capacity of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, for the reasons I have stated, and to reinvest those undistributed profits instead of systematically capitalizing them when the need is so urgent. The bill will limit the potential equity of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation to 0.5% of its loan portfolio, or over $1 billion, which is really very reasonable. This will also enable it to establish an annual reserve of about $100 million. Those amounts are more than enough to cover any eventualities, particularly if we consider the fact that this is a crown corporation and not a private insurance company. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256718"> In more specific and more concrete terms, this bill will limit the power of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation to capitalize, by limiting the amounts that can be retained in the reserve fund to 0.5% of the housing loans for which the corporation insures against risks, and to 10% of its equity. What these measures will do is ensure that anything in excess of the mandated amounts in the reserve fund and in equity will be returned to Quebec and the provinces so that they can invest the money to meet what is becoming an increasingly urgent need, as I said earlier. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256719"> If we look at the balance sheet for 2006, 0.5% of $264 billion amounts to $1.3 billion. That is the maximum amount that the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation may retain in equity, and 10% of $1.2 billion is $132 million, the maximum amount that the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation may retain in its reserve fund.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="15">(1915)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="256720"> The surplus equity, which is nearly $4 billion, and any surplus in the reserve fund, there being none at present, will go directly to Quebec and the provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256721"> The Bloc Québécois believes that the federal government, which has the resources, must invest massively in social and community housing. The reinvestment must ultimately amount to the equivalent of 1% of government program spending, or nearly $2 billion per year at the end of three years. However, as I said earlier, the provinces, and Quebec in particular, must be the ones in charge of all of these reinvestment efforts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256722"> As well, the Bloc Québécois believes that the housing market is a matter within the prerogative of the Government of Quebec. It is important that this transfer carry with it full financial compensation to remedy the historic injustices that Quebec has suffered in respect of social housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256723"> We would point out that this is not inconsistent with the mission of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, whose statutory mandate is to encourage residential construction and the repair and modernization of existing housing; to help provide access to a wide choice of affordable homes; to improve housing conditions; to ensure that low-cost financing is available; and to sustain a vibrant housing market. It must therefore stop capitalizing and put the money to work in order to fulfil its own mission.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256724"> At the same time, this mandate will be reflected in the corporate plan through the objectives that CMHC has set for itself as the main instrument of the federal government’s housing policy. Its objectives will therefore be to improve housing choice and affordability for Canadians and Quebeckers, improve housing and living conditions for Quebeckers and Canadians, support market competitiveness, job creation and housing sector well-being, and be a progressive and responsive organization. Be progressive says it all. That does not mean become a capitalist business. Quite the opposite, it is about social investment with limits, as provided by the parameters in this bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256725"> Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation has an accumulated surplus of $4.4 billion, which will reach $7 billion by 2008 if current trends continue. These surpluses are due primarily to the fact that, since 1998, almost all the retained earnings from its insurance activities have been devoted to capitalization. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256726"> Liberal critics said at the time all over the place that they were already spending 1% of the government’s program expenditures on social housing, except that these expenditures went mostly to paying mortgages on social housing built before 1994. There was nothing new, no new construction. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256727"> After that, the federal government completely withdrew from building new social housing units, at least until 2001. Needless to say the federal government’s 11-year withdrawal from the building of social and community housing had a devastating effect on moderate-income households in Quebec. Now that the Conservatives have been elected, they remain silent, which is hardly any better. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256728"> The Conservative position was very clear during the election campaign. They promised $200 million a year and federal tax credits administered by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation to encourage developers to build and restore affordable rental housing. The funding would be distributed among the provinces on a per capita basis but minimum funding would be guaranteed to the smallest companies. That is what the Conservatives promised. But now they remain silent. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256729"> What I find even more scandalous is the fact that these MPs from the Quebec City area, the 10 Conservative members from Quebec, remain completely silent, not only in this regard but in regard to Kyoto as well. The Kyoto protocol is simply being killed, and they remain silent. They remain silent too on the purchase of military equipment to the tune of $17 billion without consulting the House. On this social housing project, which is essential to the Quebec City area and all regions of Quebec, they remain silent. Not one of them has risen to defend Quebec’s interests. I want to ask them, therefore, if they were really elected to defend Quebec and not just their extreme right-wing party, to rise and defend this bill in the interests of their fellow citizens. </ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="78966" Type="18">Mr. Mark Warawa (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the Environment, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="256730">Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to speak to Bill <Document DbId="2168485" Type="4">C-285</Document>. I followed the debate with interest and I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the discussion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256731">I share the views expressed by my Conservative and Liberal colleagues, who argue that the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation should stay the course in terms of prudently managing its self-sustaining commercial activities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256732">As the House has heard before, 100% of CMHC's surplus relates to the self-sustaining activities and CMHC has a mandate to operate its insurance and securitization activities in a commercially viable manner. To do that, it sets aside capital reserve to ensure that sufficient capital is available to meet future risks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256733"> Let me illustrate this with actual figures. In 2005 CMHC capital reserve was 1.2% of the outstanding mortgages it had insured. More specific, that is $3.4 billion against $274 billion in insured mortgages. This is consistent with directions set for private sector insurers by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256734"> Also, CMHC's surplus, including amounts set aside for capitalization, forms part of the Government of Canada's accounts and is included in the calculation of the government's surplus or deficit position. This means that both budgeted and actual federal annual surplus figures include CMHC's net income. CMHC's retained earnings have serviced to reduce the government's accumulated deficit over time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256735"> Beyond the arguments regarding prudent financial management, Bill <Document DbId="2168485" Type="4">C-285</Document> would also mandate a rigid approach to housing policy, an approach that would not serve the interests of Canadians as it would legislatively mandate housing investments without regard to the current need of Canadians and how those needs may evolve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256736">Moreover, the bill would distribute funds to provinces on a per capita basis, thus ignoring the needs of aboriginal people, whose housing conditions remain well below those of most Canadians. Housing supply shortfalls, crowding and inadequate housing on reserves in the north and remote communities are of particular concern.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256737">Our first budget recognized these needs and investments in a $300 million northern housing trust and a $300 million off reserve aboriginal housing trust. This new funding will be a source of housing solutions for aboriginals and will address the cost of housing and extent of housing needs in the far north. In addition, the budget also included an investment of $450 million over two years for education, water services and housing on reserves, as well as to generally improve social economic outcomes for aboriginal women, children and families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256738">Most Canadians never have to wonder whether they have a safe warm place to come home to. However, many segments of our population are in need of safe and adequate housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256739">Let me take this opportunity to highlight some of the innovative ways the Government of Canada through CMHC is dealing with some of the issues addressed in Bill <Document DbId="2168485" Type="4">C-285</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256740"> Imagine, for example, a single mother who is fleeing from domestic violence, trying to raise three small children in a shelter or cramped studio apartment. CMHC's shelter enhancement program assists in repairing, rehabilitating and improving existing shelters for women and their children, youth and men who are victims of family violence. Through its assisted housing programs, CMHC can provide people affected by violence a way of transition out of the shelters when they are ready.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256741"> Seniors are a fast growing segment of the Canadian population. Many senior citizens want the simple dignity of being able to stay independently in the house that they have come to call their home for over 30 years. CMHC home adaptations for seniors independence program helps homeowners and landlords pay for minor home adaptations. This means that seniors with low to medium incomes can continue living in their homes longer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256742"> These are just a few examples of how the Government of Canada, through CMHC, is already tackling the issues addressed by Bill <Document DbId="2168485" Type="4">C-285</Document>. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="25">(1925)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="256743">Moreover, I would like to remind the member for <Affiliation DbId="78495" Type="2">Québec</Affiliation> that we also are taking concrete action on housing renovations. Our housing strategies seek to maintain the existing affordable housing stock in addition to creating new units. In this regard, funding for the residential rehabilitation assistance program and several related housing renovation and adaptation programs has been renewed for 2006-07 at a cost of $128.1 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256744">Using these figures once again to illustrate the impact of these programs, in 2005-06, 12,150 units were rehabilitated, close to 3,000 units were repaired on an emergency basis, some 1,220 shelters for victims of family violence were renovated, and 1,945 seniors were helped to live independently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256745">The Bloc Québécois has suggested during this debate that spending approximately $2 billion per year primarily in support of some 644 households is not good enough. I would like to remind the Bloc that we are in fact in the process of delivering on the $1 billion affordable housing initiative in collaboration with provincial, territorial and local partners. Thanks to that funding, new affordable housing is being created in communities across this country as we speak.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256746">As of June 2006, over $659 million has been committed or announced to create a total of over 27,000 new units of affordable housing. Through agreements with each province and territory, this funding is being used to create affordable housing for a wide range of Canadians, including seniors, persons with disabilities, new immigrants and low income families. Recognizing the importance of affordable housing, the 2006 federal budget also provided for an investment of $600 million to help increase the supply of affordable housing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256747">These are all examples of programs and investments that meet the changing housing needs of Canadians. They are in place because, as parliamentarians, we have the ability to ensure that our housing investments do in fact respond to the changing housing needs over time while delivering results and targeting those most in need. In contrast, Bill <Document DbId="2168485" Type="4">C-285</Document> would force CMHC and future Parliaments into a rigid, inflexible stance on the question of budgetary reserves. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256748">I have to say that I agree with the Liberal member for <Affiliation DbId="78425" Type="2">Cardigan</Affiliation> who stated during the first hour of debate that this bill is problematic from an accountability perspective, noting that it would eliminate parliamentary review of housing expenditures. The hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78425" Type="2">Cardigan</Affiliation> also briefly highlighted the fact that Bill <Document DbId="2168485" Type="4">C-285</Document> is problematic in terms of equity of distribution, as he put it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256749">The federal government has an important role to play in ensuring that the housing needs of Canadians, which are so different from region to region, are adequately met. How would an automatic annual per capita distribution of funds to provinces and territories ensure that federal housing dollars are delivering results where they are most needed? Clearly Bill <Document DbId="2168485" Type="4">C-285</Document> would take away the government's ability to be responsive to the changing and diverse housing needs of Canadians. We would not only in effect be tying the hands of future governments, we would also be weakening CMHC's ability to adapt to changing market conditions and to address the true needs of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256750">It is for the aforementioned reasons that I urge all hon. colleagues to join me in doing the right thing and voting against Bill <Document DbId="2168485" Type="4">C-285</Document>.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="256752">): Mr. Speaker, five minutes is not much to talk about the issue of social housing. I can see that the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party have more or less the same view on this issue, which is nevertheless important for the Canadian and Quebec population as a whole.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256753"> When I am given the list of repairs that have been done in social housing that already exists, I have to believe that there have been some. Still, what we want to deal with in this bill is not only the renovation and restoration of already existing housing, which dates to before 1994. Of course attention is required when roofs leak, hot water heaters have to be replaced and windows are broken. So 1% of expenditures for all government programs, or $2 billion, goes to pay social housing mortgages that already exist, as well as repairs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256754"> What Bill <Document DbId="2168485" Type="4">C-285 </Document> is seeking is new social housing. When we look at the situation, there are 450,000 households in Quebec that need social housing and $1.7 million in all of Canada. Why? Because families are living below the poverty line. Families are living with annual incomes of $10,000, $15,000 and $20,000. We know there has been an increase, in all the large Canadian cities and in Quebec, in the cost of housing and rental housing. Rents are higher. So families cannot find affordable housing, social housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256755"> The Conservatives share the same view as the Liberal Party. They say that we cannot go looking for money from the CMHC in spite of its surpluses because, we are told, it needs its reserves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256756"> I think that the Bloc Québécois is responsible enough to recognize that reserves are necessary. Even the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions says that it could keep 1% of its capital. If the CMHC has $233 billion in loan guarantees, there could be 1%, which would mean over $2 billion in reserve. The $2 billion remaining could be transferred to social housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256757"> They try to pass us off as people who lack common sense, who wanted to strangle CMHC, while it could also have a reserve. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256758"> I believe that there are urgent needs. We know that CMHC is not a private business but a crown corporation. It must return to its social mission. That is what we are asking for. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256759"> To respect its social mission, CMHC could ensure that more Canadians have access to decent housing with the money available in their budgets, which is often very limited. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256760"> Often, when a person does not have much money, housing is too expensive; if you earn a low salary and are not able to pay for it. Living accommodations cost at least $450, $500 or $600. Many people living alone cannot afford that on their salary or pension. They need help. In any case, there must be a sense of sharing, a feeling of community, and a social sense to be able to help all the people in that situation get decent housing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256761"> I think it is a slight exaggeration when people say that the Bloc Québécois wants to take all the money, all the assets of CMHC, for affordable housing. I would like to bring CMHC back to a more social vision. I am not surprised by the position of the Conservative party. As for the Liberal party, when they were in power they did nothing; they ignored the problem. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="256762"> I remind the member who just spoke that 1.7 million people in Canada need social housing. I ask the member who just spoke to lean a little more to the left, to have a heart that is a little more sensitive to the reality of people who often live in housing that is not only unaffordable but also unhealthy because they cannot get anything better. </ParaText>
