              <ParaText id="608557">Mr. Speaker, 
Nav Canada is responsible for the operation of air navigation services, ANS, in Canada. Transport Canada is responsible for the safety as well as regulatory oversight of the provision of ANS.  Oversight activities include but are not limited to regular inspections and audits of Nav Canada operations and an ongoing monitoring of all ANS activities. A flight information centre, FIC, is a centralized air traffic service unit that provides flight information services to pilots, including weather briefings, flight planning and remote and enroute radio communications.
</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608558">The rationale to offer FIC services to the Yellowknife area from the North Bay FIC was a Nav Canada decision.  North Bay employs highly skilled flight service specialists, providing what Transport Canada assesses to be a safe and reliable service. In addition, Yellowknife continues to have a flight service station which is an on-site air traffic service unit, which provides aerodrome advisory services and aviation weather observations. Transport Canada conducted an audit both of the Yellowknife flight service station, in September 2006, and North Bay FIC, in December 2006, where it was determined that both units are providing a safe and adequate service to the users.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="608568">In support of that allegation, the chair of the Canadian Federal Pilots Association tabled with the committee an affidavit from the Association’s executive assistant, Ms. Kathy Marquis, detailing a telephone conversation between herself and Mr. Preuss. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="608577">Nevertheless, circumstances do exist in which the importance of a question may require intervention by the Chair. On December 4, 1992, Mr. Speaker Fraser ruled on a case concerning threats made to a witness who had appeared before a subcommittee of the Standing Committee on Justice and the Solicitor General. The ruling, found at p. 14631 of the <I>Debates</I>, points out that there are occasions on which it is not appropriate to wait for a report from the committee before dealing with a serious breach of privilege. In that case, Mr. Speaker Fraser was faced with the fact that it might well be a period of several months before the subcommittee could meet to deal with the matter. The case before us today strikes me as being significantly different in that regard. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608578">The Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities met on March 28, 2007 for the express purpose of examining the remarks attributed to Mr. Preuss. He was present as a witness at that meeting and was vigorously questioned by committee members. At a subsequent meeting on April 23, 2007, the matter was addressed a second time, again with Mr. Preuss present as a witness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608579">Under these circumstances, it would be highly inappropriate for the Speaker to break with our past practice and pre-empt any decision the committee may choose to make. The committee is seized of the issue and if a report is presented I will of course deal with any procedural questions which may be raised as a result. Until such a report is presented however, I must leave the matter in the hands of the committee.</ParaText>

It is true that we attack the government when it does something stupid—which happens fairly often. But, at the same time, we want to offer Canadians different solutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608649">First, I would like to elaborate on the Liberal thinking on the matter of deductibility. In my opinion, our thinking is similar to the comments by my Bloc colleague.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="608650"> Let me outline the essence of our proposal. First, on April 16 the leader said in no uncertain terms that the government must scrap its policy. A few days later I, as finance critic, said the government must launch a major consultation. Today the leader has made it clear that the slower implementation of a policy that is bad does not thereby make it good, so that is an unacceptable proposal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608651">Our proposal consists of the following five points.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608652"> First, appoint a task force comprised of respected tax experts, business people and economists. Economists are sometimes useful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608653">Second, the mandate of the task force would be to review Canadian international tax policy in order to both nurture a Canadian advantage for our companies rather than create a disadvantage, as is currently proposed by the government, and also to tighten up the system where appropriate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608654">Third, the task force would review Canada's international tax treaties that have been negotiated with some 90 countries with a view to ensuring that the treaty partners are living up to the original policy expectations. In cases where this is not the case, for example, the emergence of preferential systems or a lack of transparency, the task force would recommend appropriate action. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608655">In other words, if there are cases where low tax jurisdictions are behaving in ways that are abusive or inappropriate, then we would review our relationship with those countries. In line with the recommendations of this panel of experts, the government would receive recommendations to take appropriate action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608656">Fourth, the task force would review such issues as debt dumping and double dipping, and make recommendations designed to both sustain the Canadian advantage and protect the tax base.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608657">Fifth and finally, the task force would review all other areas that it deemed relevant to its mandate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608658">I think this is a rational, responsible approach to a complex issue. It would take some time. These issues are complex, but it would lead Canada to have a modified reformed international tax policy which both nurtures the Canadian advantage, promotes our own companies, thereby creating jobs in this country, and also takes measures to address any abuses that there might be in the current system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608659">What a contrast between this rational policy which we are proposing and the chaotic, day by day changing of positions, to the point where the whole world is confused, that we have seen emanating from the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>.

              <ParaText id="608666">Why is it important to have head offices in this country? It is important for jobs. Let me give two examples as to why head offices are extremely important for good jobs, for well paying jobs, that were so important for Canada in the past and will be into the future.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="35">(1035)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="608667">The first example, which I have mentioned before in the House, is my own father, who worked for over 20 years for Alcan in Montreal, in precisely the kind of job that would not have existed had Alcan in those days been owned by a foreign company like Alcoa. He is no longer there, but hundreds and thousands like him are, and whatever the assurances of the foreign buyer may be in the short term, we can be sure that those jobs will leave Montreal, those jobs which are so vital to our city centres, big cities and small cities across the country. They will wither away and leave this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608668">A second example, slightly less personal than my father but personal enough, comes from my own riding, where a Canadian-owned company called ATI Technologies last year was sold to an American company called AMD, which is based in San José. Guess what happened? Four hundred jobs were cut as a consequence of this consolidation. How many jobs were lost in San José? Zero. How many jobs were lost in my riding of Markham? So far there are 130. That is what happens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608669"> I am not opposed to all foreign investment necessarily. Much foreign investment brings benefit, but what is totally irrational and totally incompetent is to deliberately tilt the playing field against Canadian companies in favour of foreign companies to make it all that much easier for them to acquire our companies at huge cost in terms of valuable, high paying, head office jobs. That is why this policy is so misguided.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608670">I have just about run out of time, but I have only touched the tip of the iceberg in terms of the economic incompetence of the government. I am not sure which is more incompetent between income trusts and interest deductibility. It is a close contest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608671">However, regarding income trusts, a sensible government would have taken a surgical approach, like our policy, and put a moratorium on new income trusts and a moderate tax, refundable to all but the foreigners, on income trust distributions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608672">What did the government do? It dropped a nuclear bomb on existing income trusts, thereby breaking a promise, thereby costing hard-working Canadians $25 billion, thereby depriving seniors who need their savings income to pay their bills from a valuable savings instrument, and thereby, and this is the connection with interest deductibility, weakening our once thriving energy trust sector which had been repatriating foreign capital. It has instead caused that depressed sector now to be prey to foreigners coming in to acquire them, which is precisely what is happening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608673">Another thing that is entirely illogical and stupid about the government's policy is that it claims it wants to get more tax revenue, but guess what? The unit holders of those trusts used to pay lots and lots of tax. Those foreign companies buying our income trusts will now pay no tax at all. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608674">This is an unfair policy because it costs people who trusted the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> $25 billion. It deprives Canadians of access to income trusts while giving that access only to the fat cat private equity buyers in the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608675">Fairness has become unfairness. “Advantage Canada” has become disadvantage Canada. That is why I urge the government to come to its sense and not only adopt the Liberal proposal on interest deductibility but once it concedes one thing, it is easier to concede the next. It should come to its senses the second time and adopt the Liberal policies on income trusts.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="608689">Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to help Canadians understand what all this rhetoric is about income trusts, interest deductibility and head offices in Canada. Stripped of all its rhetoric and nasty remarks about people in the government, what the Liberals are essentially saying is they want to have some businesses in Canada paying either no tax or significantly less tax than other businesses. They want to subsidize some businesses as opposed to others. They also want to have businesses to have two tax deductions for only one expense. Then they say, if this does not happen, that somehow dire consequences will flow to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608690"> I know this makes kind of an interesting political argument and gets people worked up, but we have to look at the facts, and that is what I intend to do today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608691"> Let us first of all talk about income trusts. At the present time income trusts pay no tax at all. We think that is a problem. We began to see this as a problem when huge sectors of our economy started to either move toward the no tax model, such as our telecommunications industry. Then we heard that leaders of the energy and banking sectors were moving in this direction to pay no tax, and we became quite alarmed, I have to admit that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608692">If our corporate sector is not paying taxes, then we lose significant support for the social programs about which all Canadians are very concerned. We need tax dollars from corporations to help pay for health care, education, to ensure the security of our country is strong, and the list goes on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608693">If corporations start moving to pay no tax or significantly less tax even, then what happens to these programs? The money would then have to come from ordinary individual Canadians. If corporate tax is not coming in, then that deficit has to be made up by ordinary Canadians. A lot of ordinary Canadians are on fixed incomes because they are pensioners, or they are no longer in the workforce. Even those in the workforce are already taxed to death.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608694">We have made a move to ensure that businesses in the country continue to contribute to the social fabric of the country through their tax dollars. Shoot us for doing such a terrible thing, but the fact is that it had to be done. We cannot have the business and corporate sectors in the country not contributing to the social programs of which we are all so proud and which define the country. This move had huge support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608695">Some of the analysts in the media said, “When the Liberals were in power, they did not grapple with income trusts”. They say now that the Conservative finance minister has tackled a difficult issue that the Liberals could not muster the gumption to resolve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608696">The <I>National Post</I> said, “The income trust issue is settled....in other words. It's time to move on. Everyone else has gotten the message. Why haven't Liberals”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608697">The <I>Toronto Star</I> said that what the Liberal leader should do was rethink his stand on income trusts and make the tough choice the Conservative government did and that the member for <Affiliation DbId="78924" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation> was afraid to make. It said, “ Defending tax unfairness will not win him the next election”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608698">However, the Liberals are unable to realize that we cannot have the corporate sector in the country moving to pay no taxes, or even significantly less tax. It will not work. We have to have a level playing field with tax fairness to support the social fabric of our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608699">I do not know why the Liberals cannot get that. The business sector gets that. Mr. D'Alessandro from Manulife Financial said, “I think it's the right thing. I agree with the minister's justification. Continuing on the path of income trusts would not be in the long-term interests of the country”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608700">The CEO of CI Financial Income Fund said, “It was inevitable this was going to happen. It had begun to pervert the whole of corporate Canada”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608701">I could quote so many. I do not have time. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="50">(1050)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="608702">Even the Liberals themselves supported what we did on income trusts. Sheila Copps said, “Reversing the income trust decision”, as we heard today the Liberals now want to do, “would also run afoul of espoused Liberal principles, by promoting a tax loophole for a select few, financed by the rest of us”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608703">Former Liberal finance minister John Manley said, “it was the right thing to do”. He said, “any day that good public policy triumphs is a good day”. The Liberal finance critic himself, when this policy was announced, said that it was absolutely the right thing to ensure tax fairness and to work for Canada's productivity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608704">I do not understand why the Liberals cannot see the logic. The only conclusion I have to reach is that they are mischievously and, I hate to say it, disingenuously pushing this rhetoric for purely political purposes, to try to paint the Conservative government, which had the courage to do what they did not, as somehow the bad guys. They are saying that they will not be as bad as that, that they will be friends of Canadians. That is not going to fool anybody, I hate to say in case the Liberals are under any illusions about it, because nobody buys it. People who know this area know that what we did was the right thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608705">Jim Pattison, who lost a lot of money after the income trust decision, said, “I think it was the right thing to do. Fundamentally, it was the right thing for the country”. I could quote many more business people who believe that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608706">How about the seniors who were affected, those who the Liberals say were somehow harmed by this? The National Pensioners and Senior Citizens Federation, the United Senior Citizens of Ontario and the Small Investor Protection Association have requested criminal investigations into the “deceptive cash yields used in the marketing of income trusts”. They were supported by an opinion letter sent by forensic accountant Al Rosen, who says Canadians were repeatedly lied to by marketers of the so-called income yields that many trusts were supposedly generating.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608707">The fact is there were problems with the whole scheme, the way some businesses organized their affairs, and we dealt with it. It was hard for us politically. Everyone knows that. We did not do this to win political points when we desperately needed them as a minority government. We did it because it was the right thing for Canada, for investors and for seniors. Because of that, we brought in income splitting for seniors. We also doubled the amount of the age credit so seniors could protect more of their pension incomes. We have done this in a way that is right for Canada, that gives a win to people on pensions and that is right for our whole system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608708">Let us talk about income interest deductibility. What the government wants to do is plug what we perceive to be a tax loophole where corporations are allowed two deductions for one interest expense. They can deduct it in Canada and in another country. We want to plug that loophole. We do not think corporations, even Canadian corporations, should be allowed two deductions for the same expense. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608709">Why do we think that? Because somebody has to pay for that deduction. It is a subsidy and assistance to businesses. We are happy to assist business. As everyone knows, we have done a lot to assist business, and I hope to have time to talk about that. However, we do not think there should be two deductions for the same expense. We are moving to fix that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608710">In the budget we made it clear that we were going to address tax loopholes and tax havens that distorted the level playing field on which we all paid taxes. The government wants to decrease taxes for everybody. In fact, we have done that. This year and in the next two years our government will decrease taxes to individual Canadians by $37.8 billion. That is a lot of tax relief. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="55">(1055)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="608711">We have also reduced taxes to the corporate sector. However, we can only do that for everybody if we plug the loopholes and the unfair distortions that are in the system. We made that clear. We made it clear in the budget that we would set up a panel to study this situation. I quote from page 240 of the budget where it says:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="608713">Now somehow the Liberals make this leap from trying to make our tax system fair to dire consequences for the Canadian economy. I have no doubt that they know better. The finance critic for the opposition knows better; he is an economist. Somehow, for political purposes, this doom and gloom is ringing through the halls of Parliament, simply and solely for partisan purposes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608714">I am a partisan too. I understand partisanship, but surely there has to be an element, a scintilla of responsibility in the way these arguments are put forward.

As for the income trust program, we can consider the decision to reverse the government’s position. The Conservatives had made a commitment not to change their position.

              <ParaText id="608762">Mr. Speaker, during my remarks I quoted from a number of experts. I know sometimes people do not believe politicians, but I quoted from a number of experts who say that stopping a tax loophole like double-dipping, a loophole which allows a company to make two deductions for a single expense, is the right thing to do. It is supported by experts. It was supported, as the member will know, by our own finance committee and the public accounts committee in the House of Commons. It was called for by the Auditor General. It was called for by the Jack Mintz panel, the Technical Committee on Business Taxation, and by many others. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608763">It was called for because it is the right thing to do. It levels the playing field. It allows everyone to have lower taxes instead of having big tax subsidies, tax loopholes and tax havens for a few. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608764">As the member will know, our government is committed to addressing other tax loopholes that are identified and other tax havens which distort our tax system. I am not saying that no one is going to make cries of pain when these things happen. We all know that does occur. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608765">Our government is very sensitive to input from members of Parliament, such as my friend opposite, from the business community and from other experts. We want to make sure that when we move forward on these measures, as we have on the double-dipping, that we do so in the best way possible for our economy and for those affected. We will be doing that and are doing that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608766">These dire warnings that somehow this is going to cause huge economic problems for the country are simply not true. Many experts have said that as well. I hope my friend will be reassured by that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="608767">Mr. Speaker, I am attracted to the statement that the parliamentary secretary made in terms of a level playing field. I am sure she would agree that a level playing field is one thing within the Canadian context and it is quite another thing within the global context. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608768">Many of those same experts that the parliamentary secretary has cited in fact have also given the other side of the coin with respect to capital transfers. The situation being in source countries for capital investments in Canada, there is a regime in place that is similar to interest deductibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608769">My question is one of confidence. How do people really accept the government's position that there will not be irreparable harm in terms of value added impacts on the Canadian economy for this particular initiative on interest deductibility when we see on the income trust front there has been huge harm done to people who have lost their savings? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608770">In particular, how can there be confidence when I am looking at a T-205 form which indicates that there actually is an increase in the taxable income of a quarter of a per cent in spite of the pronouncements by the government that it has reduced taxes for those on incomes below $35,000? That is not a fact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608771">How can the Canadian public have confidence if this relatively small issue has such an aberration, if you will, in fiscal legerdemain when, on the larger front, there is reason to believe that there will be a huge impact on the Canadian economy in terms of shifts of capital and the ability for Canadian firms to compete in the global economy?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="608772">Mr. Speaker, I can advise the hon. member that all developed countries work to minimize tax avoidance. Some countries do it in one fashion and other countries do it in another fashion. International tax treaties and tax arrangements dovetail. Of course, there are always changes. Whereas one country might allow a deduction in one area, it might tax in another area. We have to look for a relative balance and parity in taxation measures between and among people active in the global marketplace. The member can be sure that we are working on that all the time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608773">With respect to the purported losses on income trusts, Jack Mintz of the Rotman School of Business said this year that the Liberals are creating market uncertainty by extending false hopes to investors. The Liberals need to take yes for an answer. We have dealt with it and they should support it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608774">
                <I>The Globe and Mail</I> said that Toronto Dominion Bank data comparing the selling prices of 16 trusts now in play to their value before the tax was imposed basically say that firms are offering to buy our trusts for an average premium of about 30% above the prices the trusts were trading at before the tax announcement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608775">Time does not permit me to read the other commentary on this, but I would be happy to show my hon. friend. The bottom line is that this has not caused huge harm to the vast majority of investors. In fact, some of them will actually make money from these new arrangements. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="608782">The fact of the matter is that every tax system has a series of supports for various sectors of the economy.

              <ParaText id="608785">Mr. Speaker, the Liberal party has chosen to introduce an opposition motion today that raises a good number of points for which we are far from having ideal solutions. Having said that, this motion demonstrates how the approach of the Conservatives lacks attention to detail. They have not really found a way to solve the problems. However, the motion offers solutions that I find inadequate. Therefore, the Bloc Québécois will vote against this motion, as it is presented. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608786"> The government has not properly dealt with some problems. For example, GST rebates for tourists comes to mind. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608787"> An announcement was made but it was recognized, after the fact, that there were problems in terms of organized tours, as well as outfitters and duty-free shops. They have corrected part of that, but not everything has been settled. Since there was some improvisation, the result was that major changes had to be made later. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608788"> It is the same for income trusts, except that it is even more serious. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608789"> During the election campaign, the government said that it did not want to change the rules of the game. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608790"> Some of my fellow Quebecers, who are not necessarily supporters of the Bloc Québécois, have told me that they put their savings into these entities. They thought that the rules of the game were clear, but they were changed without notice. They want to know whether a solution can be found to this problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608791"> We have listened to them. We have to abide by the principle that companies and trusts pay their share of income tax. On the other hand, is there no solution that would counteract the negative effects this is having, particularly for individual investors? We have to put a little more thought into finding a solution. This is another example of the government’s ad hocery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608792"> On the question of deductibility, that remains to be seen, because the bill that will allow this part of the budget to be implemented has to be tabled first. Everyone has to know the rules of the game.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608793"> Next Monday, it seems, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> will make a speech to clarify the situation. However, it is obvious that the government has been very inept, and has more or less thrown the baby out with the bathwater. It sent a very ambiguous message: that the interest will no longer be deductible when investments are made for the good of our economy, even though a number of countries in the world apply that rule. On the other hand, not enough attention was drawn to the fact that this was going to eliminate tax avoidance. More work will be needed on that subject.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608794"> The Liberals have introduced a very partisan motion. When considering economic issues like these, it is a little dangerous to try to go too fast. Strangely, they seem to be reacting that way because the Conservatives went too fast themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608795"> On the question of interest non-deductibility, in order to do the job, the measure must obviously target only the abuse, very precisely. We must ensure that we achieve that result. It will not be easy, because these are very complex questions. It would be wise to think about it very carefully.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608796"> The Liberal critic is talking about a working group to discuss it, and the Minister talked about the need to fine-tune things. Maybe they could get together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608797"> It is important that a clear and moderate message be sent to the economic community and the public as a whole. I think we could agree on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608798"> The government says that it wants to tackle tax havens. In fact, the Standing Committee on Finance is meeting to consider the questions raised in a motion by the Bloc Québécois. The ultimate tax haven, the one the government should be taking on, is Barbados. Canadian companies that invest money there, knowing that the interest rate there is very low, can bring those profits back here without being taxed. That is not the general rule in tax treaties. Ordinarily, they provide that when money is invested in another country, it is taxed when it returns to Canada, if the two tax systems are not equivalent. But under the Liberal government, a little paragraph was added—in section 5907—exempting that money from taxation, with the result, according to the Auditor General’s 1990 estimates and the extrapolation by Statistics Canada, that this income amounts to $4 billion annually. It comes in from Barbados and it is not taxed.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="608799"> I believe, at a rough estimate, that we end up losing some $800 million in income tax revenues. Obviously this money that businesses do not pay—because they take advantage of this tax haven—is money that others pay, middle class people and all taxpayers who do their part. This also means less money that could be allocated in part to social programs. On one hand there are companies that can bring home profits without being taxed, and on the other there are people who are paying too much in taxes because of this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608800"> That is a considerable amount of money. There is a way of settling this problem, namely by quite simply getting rid of section 5907. This very concrete and practical measure could be implemented. It would immediately have a very significant effect and it would send the following message to all taxpayers: we are trying to make the situation a bit fairer; we do not tolerate this sort of situation. This is a tax loophole with the ability to disappear clearly and neatly, if the practical solution is applied. However, as far as interest deductibility is concerned, it is not easy to know what the solution is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608801"> So there is a problem. The Liberals are dealing with it in one way in the motion, but in our opinion a lot of things are getting all mixed up at once. This issue is being associated with the fact that there are a lot of foreign takeovers of companies. This may be one element, a variable that is taken into account, but it is also the result of several years of operation in Canada, during which people were told that this is a free market and we would see, in the end, whether we were winners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608802"> A detailed analysis of this question is needed. It is true that many Canadian companies are buying foreign companies. The net result, though, even if there are more that buy foreign companies, as far as the size of investments goes, we are clearly in the red. This matter must be examined. The solutions, however, are systemic, and a much broader policy will be needed than the one found in the motion we are discussing today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608803"> The first aspect in the motion is the issue of non-deductibility. The second aspect is the issue of trusts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608804">There is a big problem with income trusts because people have to pay their taxes. It became clear that the mechanism that was created for a certain kind of capital was being used by companies in sectors that clearly did not need it. A trend was developing, especially in telecommunications. It became a way to get a tax break without producing wealth. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608805">I think that the underlying principle was unacceptable. That being said, the way they did it was also unacceptable because they pulled the rug out from under investors without warning after having told them that the rules of the game would not change. People who had saved up $50,000 or $100,000 or $200,000—their life savings or at least a substantial portion thereof—were deprived of income that, in many cases, they had worked for their whole lives. I can well understand why people who have been affected by this issue are angry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608806">So how should we react to the Liberals' motion? Apparently, according to the Liberals' proposal for income trusts, people should be taxed according to the alternative solution the Liberals proposed, which was summarized in the 14th report of the Standing Committee on Finance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608807">Let us not forget that this report was the product of a consensus indicating that solutions had to be examined. The Bloc Québécois proposed a simple solution: extending the moratorium, the transfer period, from four to 10 years. The Liberals suggested another proposal that we consider unacceptable. As such, that part of the Liberals' motion is totally unacceptable to the Bloc Québécois because they are trying, in a roundabout way, to make it all non-taxable. I think that that aspect of the motion has no future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608808">The bottom line is that there is now a perception among electors and the general population that some people are more equal than others when it comes to taxation. Because of the complexity of the systems, because of what has been developed over the years, because of the expertise that some companies may have access to, there are some people who maximize their tax benefits, to the limit and to the extreme. Hence the reaction of wanting to do away with the tax advantage.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="30">(1130)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="608809">We must take the time to think and look at how these things are determined to ensure that at the end of the day, the reaction is sensible and rational. Sometimes, the possibility of tax savings should be available, because it has positive impacts on the economy. But we must find ways to stop abuse from happening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608810">The Liberal motion also refers to the fact that the government's two measures are the cause of foreign takeovers. I do not think that a direct causal link can be made in this way, but the fact remains that we must address the phenomenon of foreign takeovers of Canadian and Quebec companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608811">In Quebec, we are obviously now carefully assessing what the impact of Alcoa's takeover of Alcan would be. All the consequences of such a takeover must be reviewed, because based on the information I have seen, this transaction would mean that 37% of all of this new giant's aluminum production would come from Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608812">Are there not in fact benefits to be gained from this kind of transaction? We must have a closer look at this and ensure that the existing legal mechanisms concerning foreign investment review are fully utilized. In that respect, we must ensure that our legislation is consistent with the new, current economic reality of globalization. Ultimately, when a transaction is being assessed for its relevance to the Canadian economy, important social factors must also be considered, such as the impact on employment in certain regions, for instance, and the repercussions of such a transaction on older workers. Not only will this serve to correct some purely economic aspects, but it will also take into account other types of impact we can expect to see.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608813">This motion is a bit of a hodgepodge of a number of conditions. In my opinion, its current wording is a little outdated, considering our current reality. On one hand, with respect to interest deductibility, the minister announced that he will make a statement next Monday that will make his position clear. On the other hand, yesterday, the day before the debate on this motion, the Liberal finance critic himself suggested that an expert panel should examine this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608814">Perhaps we need to head more in this direction, in order to ensure that the Standing Committee on Finance, which is currently working on these issues, can complete its work, reach some conclusions and make some recommendations, especially since we can sense the government's desire to achieve some real results and outcomes. I thank the government for its support of the Bloc Québécois motion to study the issue of tax havens. This proves that they want to have a closer look at these issues. However, we must be prepared to study all situations. Certain aspects have to do with interest deductibility. There is also the matter of the treaty with Barbados, which, in my view, is a key factor. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608815">I hope that the Standing Committee on Finance can produce a report on which there is as much agreement as possible, with recommendations that will have an impact as soon as possible. Maybe we can set as our deadline the fall economic statement or, at the latest, next year's budget. Clearly, if the work of the Standing Committee on Finance should result in a recommendation to abolish section 5907, which enables companies to bring $4 billion in profits from Barbados back to Canada without paying taxes, that would send a message to Canadians that their elected representatives have identified a fundamental inequity that must be corrected. I think that would be a key recommendation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608816">In my opinion, the committee should take a thorough look at interest deductibility. This week, we met with experts from the Canada Revenue Agency, who are very cautious about these and other issues.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="608817">It is not easy to get figures. The government needs to be more transparent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608818">The message that should be sent to people at the finance department or the revenue agency or to other government experts is that we need information in order to make the right recommendations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608819">We need to stop playing hide and seek with money, or else we will encourage the current perception that there can be inequity in the tax system, but it cannot be addressed because it is protected by people behind the scenes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608820">We have a wonderful opportunity to move forward and correct this situation in the Standing Committee on Finance. Personally, I hope that this will be the best way of ensuring that, at the end of the day, we can make recommendations to address these issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608821">Regarding income trusts, Bill <Document DbId="2801101" Type="3">C-52</Document> is already before us. The budget has been adopted and now must be implemented. What we must do is keep listening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608822">We have to listen to people who have suffered serious losses, those in a position to provide arguments on this issue. Maybe we should hold a debate in the fall, and, in a future budget, determine what is feasible. Nonetheless, we must always respect the principle of tax fairness and strive to make changes that will improve the situation, allow more fairness in taxation and take into account any potential impact on the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608823">We can learn from this motion and keep the following in mind. When the government makes announcements on economic investments—primarily in the budget and on other occasions—it should make sure that it has considered every possibility and not present half-baked initiatives. Otherwise, we are sending economic stakeholders a mixed message. That is what the government has to be aware of now in the matter of deductibility of interest expenses. There needs to be a clearer message.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608824">Consider the example I gave on the GST rebate for tourists. Again, there is still some work to complete. Often it is not just a matter of small details, but things that have a major economic impact. These days, we must always consider the big picture in the context of globalization.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608825">Like everyone else, the representatives of the multinationals in Canada—whose head office may be in the United States or elsewhere—are well aware of the conditions on investments. We should not have to kneel down to these companies. We should make sure the representatives from Quebec or Canada within these multinationals have what they need to get authority from their head offices in order to capitalize on factors that would attract the companies and create the right conditions to move forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608826">We thought the Conservative government would have been particularly sensitive about the importance of these issues, but we are seeing the opposite and it is quite surprising. The government, which says it defends business interests, has introduced a number of initiatives that lack polish, that need fine tuning, especially on aspects that could have been planned or have already been studied. These initiatives could have been introduced and implemented in a very clear manner. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608827">I am not saying that decisions can always be made that work for everyone. Sometimes we must make decisions even if some people will be penalized. However, in the end, the criteria to be considered are transparency and respect for what has been proposed. If ever there is a need to reverse a decision or way of doing things because a party, having come into power, realizes that it was mistaken, then a way must be found to penalize the fewest possible people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608828">Promises made during an election campaign—such as the one pertaining to income trusts—are in some ways moral commitments, contracts entered into with the voter. In this case, the Conservatives have broken this moral contract. Therefore, we are right to bring forward our proposals. However, the way in which the Liberal Party is proposing to move forward in this motion, today, is unacceptable. With regard to the proposed solutions, the motion does not reflect comments made about interest deductibility. With regard to income trusts, it is even worse, because the proposal does not resolve the basic issue of the need for tax equity.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="608829">Mr. Speaker, in this debate it is important to look at some of the facts and I would comment that just earlier today there was an interesting fact given apparently by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78332" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> where she said that the Liberal Party over the last 13 years received $280,000 in donations from CAITI, the Canadian Association of Income Trust Investors. That organization did not even come into existence until January 2007. I believe there is a problem here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608830">I would like to ask the member who spoke most recently a question, since the Bloc has announced that it is not going to be supporting the motion, which in fact deals with abuses but also promotes tax fairness. Is he aware that $7.5 billion of tax revenue is lost to the Government of Canada, $6 billion of that due to the private equity takeout of income trusts, income trusts that have been bought at fire sale prices since this terrible punitive tax was announced on October 31, 2006, and a further $1.5 billion of revenue with regard to the privately urged buyout of Bell and Telus?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608831">Tax fairness means that we have to have a system which ensures that Canadians continue to have the support of the tax revenues from Canadian business and industry. However, when we have these private equity buyouts, and they are structured in a way where Canada gets zero, that is why we have lost $7.5 billion a year projected. That is compared to the so-called tax leakage of the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> over six years of only $5 billion. It makes no sense. Why is the Bloc not supporting the motion?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="608832">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for his question. As to the comments made by the NDP and the Liberals, I will leave it to them to sort it out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608833">First, the major problem with the whole tax fairness issue is the Barbados convention and the $4 billion that comes back here from Barbados tax-free. We think there is a simple solution to this problem, a solution that should have shown up somewhere in the Liberals' motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608834">The second reason we do not support the motion is the disconnect between the Liberal critic's statements about an action plan not unlike the one the government wants to implement, and the motion, which attacks the government from a very partisan perspective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608835">Given that we are being asked to vote on the text of the motion, that is not nearly good enough. We are facing a huge problem on the issue of fairness and income trusts. The Conservatives promised one thing but are doing another. That being said, the situation could not be allowed to go on because everyone has to pay their share.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608836">With respect to income trusts, all of the tax experts helped companies figure out how to turn income trusts into a tax efficiency tool without necessarily creating wealth. As such, changes had to be made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608837">That is why the Bloc will not vote for this motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608838">I will conclude by saying that the Bloc Québécois believes that the Liberals' adjustment proposal as written in the motion is not an acceptable way to deal with income trusts.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="608843">But there are major financial implications. The budget implementation bill will be introduced shortly. I am very anxious to see how the minister will clarify the issue in his speech on Monday.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608844">The government's announcement has caused an outcry, and companies' reactions are having a significant economic impact. People need assurances that the part that enables companies to compete internationally is good. However, tax avoidance looks like a business subsidy. We therefore need to find a way to address this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608845">I will give an example. A small business in my riding won a $30 million contract from England, but may have to buy a small company there to manage operations. In a case like this, interest deductibility is valuable if it helps the business grow. It could also have negative consequences, though, and I do not need to mention any examples of that here. This is what we must prevent. That is why it will be important for the committee to seriously examine the budget implementation bill and for the government to make a serious proposal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608846">Once the bill is introduced, no further amendments can be made on this issue. Let us hope that all the necessary consultations will have taken place and that if we take different positions, we will find ways of ensuring that the final answer benefits Canada's economy but still produces satisfactory tax fairness. The measure announced in the budget is interesting, but the message is not clear and is causing an outcry. We need to find a solution that gives us the tax fairness we want.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="608851">Tax fairness is important. If the public has the perception that a measure is not fair, it will be difficult to uphold it.

              <ParaText id="608856">It is interesting that the member stands in this House or heckles from his seat at about the identical moment that I received a threatening email from Brent Fullard, who is the coordinator for the Canadian Association of Income Trust Investors. I find it rather curious to see this kind of ongoing tactic of intimidation and threats that have been used by this association when it comes to anyone who opposes the Liberal position. I certainly find it reprehensible that the Liberals would immediately adopt that same kind of line and tactic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608857"> I want to say very clear for the record that my concern generally about the Liberals has been made more clear by the fact that the statistics we have received indicate the donations that have been made by members of the Canadian Association of Income Trust Investors to the Liberal Party and to leadership contenders, including I might add the member for <Affiliation DbId="78821" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation> who received a donation in his leadership bid. The member for <Affiliation DbId="78821" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation> received $5,000 from James Kinnear, president of Pengrowth Energy Trust, one of the founding members of the Canadian Association of Income Trust Investors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608858">Now that is a pretty small amount in comparison to the amount of money that actually went to Bob Rae, which was in the neighbourhood of $40,000. Yet, it is about in the same neighbourhood as the amount of money that went to the leader of the Liberal Party. I have not even mentioned the money that went to the leadership campaign for the member for <Affiliation DbId="78667" Type="2">Etobicoke—Lakeshore</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608859"> I raise this today because in fact there are huge questions about why the Liberals felt so compelled to take up the cause of the Canadian Association of Income Trust Investors. They feel so compelled today to defend this organization and the member representatives of this organization, and have no compunction about standing in this House and identifying with Brent Fullard and the president of this association when he writes me that I need to publish an immediate retraction of my supposed false statements and assertions made, otherwise I will face a lawsuit.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="608868">Mr. Speaker, I am glad you called him to order. I have found it difficult this morning to listen to what I consider to be very sexist comments of a personal nature and I find that it continues now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608869">It is interesting. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that today is his birthday and so, on behalf of everyone in this House, I would be happy to wish him a happy birthday and ask him to relax and consider what we are talking about today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608870">We are debating the question of corporate giveaways, tax havens and tax loopholes at a time when Canadians are finding it hard to make ends meet, and are finding that their share of income taxes went up and up on a personal basis, while corporate taxation is going down and down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608871">Perhaps the member for <Affiliation DbId="78821" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation> needs to be reminded how he has made some very curious statements over the years himself, going back to a few years ago when he suggested that the Kyoto protocol was written on the back of a barf bag. That was changed to the Kyoto protocol being written on the back of a napkin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608872">Let us get our facts straight. Let us understand that whether we are talking about Kyoto, or we are talking about corporate loopholes, or talking about income trusts, or income interest deductibility, we have to ensure that we are talking from the basis of facts and from the point of view of trying to understand why a party that had 13 years to address this serious situation chose not to. The Liberal Party chose not to close tax loopholes such as Barbados and today is standing up in the House and defending two programs that have been identified as a way to give more and more money to corporations at a time when Canadians are struggling and paying more and more of their income tax to support government programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608873">Canadians want balance. They want an understanding that the government is prepared to apply a measure of fairness. They have seen none of that from the Liberals. The Conservative proposals to date may be somewhat confusing. There may be some need for clarification, but at least the Conservatives have identified some areas of corporate taxation that are not justified and have to be dealt with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608874">The motion we have today is interesting because it really is a rare 12-year-old blend of Liberal corporate friendly neglect of tax havens and tax loopholes with the Liberal corporate friendly neglect of income trusts. That is the essence of this motion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608875">Only the Liberals, and we have seen it again this morning, have the nerve to drag out their past failures to act for ordinary Canadians rather than corporations and get self-righteous about it at the same time. Only Liberals can do that. Is there no end? Is there no end to the lengths the Liberals will go to help feather the bed of Canada's corporate elite?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608876">It is not a hidden fact, not unknown information, that Canadian corporations will take advantage of any existing tax havens and loopholes to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. The role of government is to deal with those loopholes that are unfair and allow for income to be hidden and taxes to be avoided. It is something we pleaded with the Liberals to do for years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608877">I want to go back to the whole Barbados tax haven debate. We raised in 2003 the Barbados tax haven and the fact that the company owned by the present member for <Affiliation DbId="78571" Type="2">LaSalle—Émard</Affiliation>, the former prime minister of this country, former leader of the Liberals, had used the Barbados tax haven as a tax avoidance measure. That was clearly, irrefutably stated in 2003 when this whole issue was dealt with by the Ethics Commissioner.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="608882">I could go on. There is no shortage of evidence to show that in fact this was a tax haven that was used by Liberals, it was a benefit to Liberals, and the Liberals stand today refusing to address that issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608883">There is a real question for the Conservatives today. They have dealt with income trusts. They have dealt with interest deductibility. Will they finally deal with this outstanding issue left by the Liberals? Will they finally close the Barbados tax haven? Will they finally shut down this lucrative vehicle for Canadian companies to hide money, companies such as Merck Frosst, which is being audited for putting $2 billion in the Barbados tax haven and not paying taxes?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608884">Is that not enough of a reason for the government to act? Is that not enough of a justification for the Conservatives to make a commitment in the House today that they are going beyond interest deductibility measures and income trust provisions to deal with tax havens and all other loopholes, havens and hidden arrangements that allow businesses to avoid paying their fair share of taxes?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608885">What is at stake here is that hard-working, honest Canadians are left to pick up the slack. There is nothing about that in this Liberal motion. There is nothing about how the balance shifted between the corporations and individual hard-working Canadians over the last 10 years that the Liberals were in power. There is nothing in the motion that says we will actually work to ensure that corporations pay their fair share of taxes and ordinary Canadians will start to get a break. There is not a word.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608886">Why is that? The Liberals have a chance to bring a motion to this House and what do they do? They bring something that stands up to defend corporations and the likes of these companies I have just mentioned, companies that want to see the income trust program maintained exactly as it was because they stand to benefit. They are companies like Brompton Funds, Gluskin Scheff and Associates, Borden Ladner Gervais, Lawrence Asset Management, and Pengrowth Energy Trust; the list goes on of people, organizations, businesses and trusts that are part of the Canadian Association of Income Trust Investors. Yet those Liberals stand here and get all excited because we have identified the fact that there are donations going back and forth between these organizations and the Liberal Party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608887">I think the question for Canadians is legitimate. What kind of influence has this had on the Liberal Party? Why has it taken such a clear stance against cracking down on corporate loopholes? What is behind this whole support of big banks and big corporations?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608888">I suppose one could argue that the Liberal finance critic's connections to Bay Street are reason enough, but surely we leave some of the hats we have worn in previous lives at the door when we enter this place, try to do what is in the best interests of the public, and put in place good public policy. We have not seen evidence of that to date. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608889">In fact, as a good example of this, just two days ago at our finance committee I attempted once again to convince committee members to call upon the banks to give to the committee and to Parliament information pertaining to the costs of providing ATM services, to give a breakdown of those fees and to enunciate the profits involved in that particular operation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608890">Those were reasonable requests, I believe. Canadians have a right to basic information. The banks have a responsibility to be somewhat transparent and accountable to Canadians. That is why we have a Bank Act. That is why this place spends a great deal of time on banking legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608891">However, would members believe that except for two Liberals, the rest, including the Liberal finance critic and the former Liberal finance critic, voted against that motion? It is not surprising that the Conservatives did as well. Surprisingly, the Bloc supported the Liberals and the Conservatives on this, so we are left with no motion and with no message from this place to ask the banks to provide basic information.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="10">(1210)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="608892">I am not talking about a motion at the finance committee to call on the government to end ATM fees, although certainly that is something that I think has to be addressed by this place. I was simply asking for this place to ask for information that the consumers of this country have a right to know. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608893">What are the different fees that banks are charging? Under what terms and circumstances? What are the costs? What is the profit margin? How do the banks justify the huge profits and the price gouging, which is so evident when it comes to ATMs? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608894">Here is our example of what is wrong with the Liberals in this place and their supposed concern about the public good: when push comes to shove, each and every time Liberals stand up against consumers and on the side of big banks and big corporations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608895">Now, to talk about the issue of foreign investments, those members are making the spurious connection between the problem of foreign takeovers of Canadian businesses and the interest deductibility and the income trust programs. There is no connection.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608896">In fact, I would hope by now that members clearly would have read some of the expert advice. Let us go back to Jack Mintz, who actually called for the removal of this interest deductibility provision, the double-dipping, a number of years ago. Perhaps he has changed his mind now. We are not sure, given the fact that the Liberals are using his name, but it was clear back when the Auditor General made this recommendation, and on numerous occasions, that Jack Mintz made this recommendation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608897"> Others made this recommendation because in fact it is a case of revenue being lost to Canada because of an escape hatch, because of double dipping, because of corporate interests taking advantage of a provision that was not intended for double dipping but which has become so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608898">I would hope that members might have listened very carefully and might have read the letter we received from the Canadian Labour Congress. I know that members on the Liberal side often like to cite the CLC and Ken Georgetti's words in many of their debates and like to create the illusion of being on the side of workers. They pretend that they are all in favour of ending anti-scab legislation and then they turn around and vote against it. Or they pretend they are in favour of cracking down on poor working conditions and lack of pay equity and they do not take any measures when they have their chance to do so. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608899">However, I would hope that in this debate they would at least listen to the words of Ken Georgetti and the CLC, who have written very clearly to the minister and to parliamentarians expressing support for the promise in the budget to end the corporate tax deductions for interest on debt used to finance foreign affiliates, stating:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="608908">Time and time again the Liberals have come forward with motions in this place, with projects for the finance committee and with recommendations that fly in the face of any kind of progressive policies that will actually ensure benefits for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608909">I can only say as I said in committee when the Liberals so vehemently denied my request for information about bank fees, something that still boggles the mind, that it is hard to believe the Liberals would oppose a motion as simple as mandatory disclosure of ATM fees, or that they would vote against public accountability for proposed bank closures, or that they would vote against the limitation of cheque holds to 24 hours; or that they would vote against disclosure of security breaches leading to identity theft, or that they would vote against adherence to an international standard in handling consumer complaints, or that they would vote against increased penalties of banks for violations.</ParaText>

Main Street runs through my constituency of Winnipeg North. It is one of the most hard pressed constituencies anywhere in this country, with very serious economic problems.

              <ParaText id="608941"> I would suggest that the member and his party consider the error of their ways on these two files, income trusts and interest deductibility. They should consider the following question. Why would Canada give up tax revenue to create economic activity and tax revenue in other countries? It would be to increase the profitability of Canadian banks that already are rolling in profits to the tune of $19 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608942">If the member is so concerned about the questions pertaining to other countries' taxation policies, he should be standing in the House today and making the recommendation that we start taxing corporations on a worldwide basis, something that he fails to consider.

              <ParaText id="608988">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today on this debate, but I am saddened by the nature of this debate. The Conservative government has inherited the best fiscal situation, the best economic environment, of any incoming government in the history of Canada. Even though it was a great economic environment and a great way to start based on the Liberal record of strong economic management, we cannot rest on any laurels. We live in a hyper-competitive, global environment where companies and countries are either moving ahead or they are falling behind. We cannot simply sit still.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608989">A smart country, like a smart company, makes good decisions based on what is best to address the challenges and opportunities of the next 10, 20, 30 years, the next century. We have a government that instead of focusing on the challenges and opportunities of the next century is too focused on this week's polls. It is making decisions based on short terms, based on what is popular right now at the expense of the long term competitiveness of our Canadian economy, Canadian companies, Canadian investors, and ultimately Canadian workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608990">We do not have smart decision making coming from the government and the sad thing is that we have Conservative economic incompetence propped up by NDP economic ignorance. This is a toxic combination for the long term competitiveness of Canadians and for the long term job security of Canadian workers.</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">I dread to imagine what the discussion around the federal cabinet table was last fall concerning measures such as income trusts or interest deductibility restrictions. Did anyone bring up the potential, unintended consequences? Was a huge menu, and range of varied options the topic of lively, heated and lengthy discussion? Were the nuances of capital market reactions, or taxation matters, debated? Was the obvious alternative of cutting taxes on dividends instead of trashing income trust promises a subject of great discussion? Were the studies, commissioned by the previous government, and its many other solutions, reviewed carefully over days and nights by all cabinet members so they could deliberate in an authoritative fashion? Or was talk just about how to finesse the treachery to seniors and Alberta about a promise broken?</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="608995"> It is clear that the government made the wrong decisions in both cases. Conservatives have imperilled the competitiveness of Canadian companies. They have hurt Canadian economic sovereignty and have exposed Canadian equities to unparalleled levels of foreign takeover activities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608996">I really do believe and have tremendous faith in the ability for Canadian companies to compete and succeed globally. We have global success stories that are based here in Canada. In fact, there are companies like Onex and Magna that are building and continue to build global success stories based here in Canada. But the fact is that the Government of Canada ought to partner with these success stories and be a partner in progress as these companies move forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608997">In today's global environment, economically, a company is either acquiring or is being acquired. A company is either growing or is getting smaller. It cannot sit still. We represent a fairly small percentage of the global economy here in Canada. We represent about 1.5% of global capital markets as an example of that, so because of the challenges and opportunities of globalization and the pressures of it, Canadian companies cannot grow exclusively within Canada. For Canadian companies to grow, it requires acquisitions outside of the country. Other governments in other parts of the world understand this.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="608998">The fact is in countries like Japan, the United States, Britain, countries in Europe, basically every country in the industrialized world, if a company invests in another country or purchases a company in another country, the company can write off the interest on that investment against domestic earnings. That is a tax practice that is global. That is a tax practice that is well accepted and is part of the competitiveness of those companies in those countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="608999">It is unspeakably naive and economically ignorant to believe that we are not hurting Canadian companies by exposing them to the competition from around the globe and at the same time imposing on them a tax measure that companies in other countries do not face. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609000">If we are really interested in owning the economic levers here in Canada, if we are really interested in our economic sovereignty, why would we expose our Canadian companies to the fierce global competition that exists now, and at the same time tie their hands behind their backs by imposing on them a tax that no other industrialized country imposes on their domestic industries? It is wrong-headed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609001"> The fact that the Conservative government has to depend on the support of the economically ignorant NDP on this speaks to this. I knew that the Conservative government was not progressive socially, but with this measure it is not even conservative economically.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609002">The fact is that the Conservatives have talked over the years about reducing corporate taxes. I want to clarify. I really believe in reducing income tax, personal and corporate. The hon. member has mentioned that this is a government that actually cut the GST, a consumption tax, to raise income tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609003">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> calls himself an economist. If economists were a licensed body, he would have lost his licence over that one, because there is no economic body in the world that would endorse increasing an income tax to help compensate for the decrease of a consumption tax. It was bad economic policy. It was bad for competitiveness. It is consistent, though, with the government on a number of decisions that it is making, including hurting Canadian competitiveness with this latest tax measure, eliminating the interest deductibility on foreign investments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609004">As I was saying, the Conservatives have spoken over the years about the importance of reducing corporate taxes, but I want to explain to them that what we are supposed to do is reduce corporate tax rates, not to reduce corporate profits and not to reduce the actual base. Their measures will reduce the corporate tax base. In fact, perhaps over time they will not reduce corporate taxes by eliminating corporations from Canada. The Conservatives will, with the support of the NDP, drive those head office jobs out of Canada, drive those Canadian international success stories like Alcan and BCE out of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609005">They will create the opportunities for firms on Wall Street and international takeover firms to acquire the key components of the Canadian economy. Not only will what they do hurt Canadian economic sovereignty, it will kill jobs and our ability to actually build our economic capacity and to chart an independent direction as a country in the future. If you do not own your economic levers in a country, you really do not control the future destiny of your country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609006">Since the government's decision on income trusts, we have seen a flurry of takeovers of the energy trust sector. That has hurt our economic sovereignty. A key industry in Canada is energy. We are seeing as a result of the interest deductibility decision an increase in the rate of foreign takeovers and bids here in Canada, the latest discussions around Alcan, and the Bell Canada discussion. That is a government that threatens to take the Canada out of Bell Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609007">On another issue, the industry minister has said on Wall Street recently that he is interested in eliminating the foreign ownership restrictions on Canadian Telco. The government is not only weakening Canadian corporate interests and exposing them to takeover interests, but it is actually putting in place tax and regulatory measures that will lead to the hollowing out of Canadian corporate assets and the end of Canadian economic sovereignty.</ParaText>

What the government has in fact done by eliminating the interest deductibility for foreign investments is actually tilt the balance toward foreign competitors to help them take over Canadian companies, as we handcuff the Canadian companies and reduce their capacity to build competitiveness and to take over firms in other countries. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="609020">As the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> has noted on many occasions, our economic fundamentals are solid. We are experiencing the second longest period of economic expansion in Canadian history. Core inflation remains within our set range of one to three per cent. Our unemployment rate is at its lowest in at least 30 years, perhaps 40, with more Canadians working than ever before. We are on the best fiscal footing of any country in the G-7. In fact we are the only member of the G-7 with ongoing budget surpluses and falling debt burden.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="609024">It was hard for the <Affiliation DbId="105458" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> to set priorities when in power, and he is showing the same flaws in his latest musings on the economy.

              <ParaText id="609026">Budget 2007 provides a clear series of measures to secure the aforementioned advantages. It demonstrates this government's commitment to a comprehensive approach to building a strong Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="609030">For example, we are reducing the number of annual tax filings and remittances for more than 350,000 small businesses in Canada. For some smaller businesses, the number of tax filings and remittances could drop from 34 to as few as 10, a 70% decrease.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="609034">This government is decisively addressing the issue of helping employers meet immediate skill shortages. For example, budget 2007 proposes a series of improvements to the temporary foreign worker program designed to reduce processing delays and more effectively respond to regional labour and skill shortages. New measures include expanding the online application system, maintaining lists of occupations where there are known shortages of workers and processing work permits more rapidly. This will ensure that the process of hiring skilled foreign workers for not only large but also small and medium sized enterprises is easier, faster and less costly for employers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609035">On a larger scale, budget 2007 provides a number of measures that will help Canadian businesses invest, compete and win in the global marketplace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609036">Canada, historically, has benefited from vibrant, competitive capital markets. With the mobility of talent, capital and ever intensifying global competition, developing leading edge principles and rules to govern our capital markets is key to creating and sustaining the Canadian advantage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609037">In budget 2007, Canada's new government put forward a plan for creating a Canadian advantage in global capital markets. It focuses on four key building blocks: First, enhancing regulatory efficiency through a new approach to securities regulation based more on principles and tailored to the unique makeup of Canada's capital markets; second, strengthening market integrity by pursuing the highest standards of governance and by enforcing our laws more vigorously; third, creating greater opportunity for businesses and investors by pursuing free trade in securities with the United States and the other G-7 countries; and fourth, improving investor information by introducing a new principles based disclosure regime for bank investment products with complex features.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609038">Another important initiative to support businesses is our global commerce strategy to ensure that Canadian businesses can fully participate in global market opportunities. In addition, Canada and the United States have agreed in principle to update the Canada-U.S. tax treaty to facilitate cross-border investment and commerce.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609039">Canada is strong because our businesses, large and small, are strong. For example, just yesterday Statistics Canada noted that direct Canadian investment abroad hit $523 billion, a gain of $63.7 billion over just last year, or a 13.8% increase over 2005. That was the fastest percentage increase since the technology boom of 2000. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609040">It is clear that this government is unquestionably committed to helping our businesses compete and succeed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609041">The official opposition has voted against every one of these measures designed to create a global advantage for Canadian businesses. It did not get the job done when in power, which is why its current rhetoric rings hollow.</ParaText>

He might be interested to hear that McGill University actually pointed out that that government had the strongest economic performance record in more than half a century, much stronger than his government's performance, which benefited from the decisions made by that Conservative government, which were difficult at the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609049">This government has also made very difficult decisions predicated on tax fairness for all Canadians. The Liberals may not want tax fairness. They want to stand up for their buddies on Bay Street, the big money influence, who they do not think should pay any tax. </ParaText>

CAITI and the Liberal Party may not support tax fairness but Canada's new government absolutely does, and I am proud to stand with it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="609058">Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has made a very good point. If we are going to bring in tax fairness we need to be very careful in what we are doing. The <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> has been very clear. He said that what this will come down upon is the issue of double-dipping. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609059">A case was brought forward at the finance committee the other day where the CRA pointed out a specific example of a Canadian firm that borrowed $200 million from a tax haven of at 10%.

              <ParaText id="609062">Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="78435" Type="2">Peterborough</Affiliation> for his excellent speech and his excellent responses to questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609063">I am pleased to have the opportunity to debate the importance of international investment to Canadians and to their continued prosperity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609064">Canada's and the world's economy has fundamentally changed over the past two decades. The dramatic reduction in communications and transportation costs, combined with successive rounds of trade liberalizations and countries' efforts to liberalize their investment regimes, have encouraged greater international competition for capital, technology and markets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609065">The growth in international flows of capital or foreign direct investment has significantly outpaced the growth of trade in GDP over the past two decades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609066">World inward investment more than doubled during the 1980s, more than tripled during the 1990s and may well quadruple by the end of this decade. This is a trend that Canadian firms and consumers benefit from, and I will explain how.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609067"> The benefits of foreign investment are well-established. First and foremost, foreign investment creates jobs for Canadians. Foreign investment fosters a more competitive domestic economy. Foreign companies investing in Canada create healthy competition for domestic firms, resulting in more efficient production that benefits consumers through lower prices and more innovative products and services. There is significant evidence that increased competition leads to greater use of new technologies among domestic manufacturing plants and that productivity spills over from foreign controlled plants to domestically controlled plants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609068">Foreign investment also provides Canadian companies linkages to markets. Foreign investment enables Canadian firms to be integrated into global value chains. More must be done to encourage the two way flow of foreign direct investment that helps to galvanize the global value chain. Canadian companies have increased their involvement in China and other overseas countries through contracts with foreign companies and by setting up facilities. Why? It is to tap into these fast growing economies, to secure these markets and to capitalize on Canadian and international advantages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609069">The vast majority of multinational enterprises driving the global investment trends are our historical trade and investment partners: the United States, Europe and Japan. Combined, they are the source of over 80% of global investments and the destination for two-thirds of global investments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609070">In addition to our traditional trade and investment partners, new competitors are entering the global stage, namely, China, India, Russia, Mexico and Brazil. With this rise, is the expansion of FDI from emerging economy multinationals. As a result, developing country investments abroad now account for one-tenth of global FDI.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609071">My constituents of Oshawa know firsthand the benefits of FDI and international trade. In 1875, Colonel R.S. McLaughlin relocated his Canadian-owned McLaughlin Carriage Company to Oshawa. After developing a stable and profitable Canadian company, McLaughlin Carriage was sold to the U.S.-based automotive manufacturer General Motors, in 1918. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609072">Since that time, General Motors has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into our region, creating hundreds of thousands of good paying jobs and investing millions into our community. Oshawa now boasts of hosting General Motors of Canada's national headquarters, Canadian Regional Engineering Centre, and North America's largest manufacturing facility. The results have been the development of a strong economy in the region, hundreds of millions of dollars in spinoffs and economic benefits, and a better community. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609073">Granted, over our history there have been some tough times and job losses due to economic slowdowns and pressures from the vast global economy but my constituents and I know, wholeheartedly, the benefits that foreign direct investment by General Motors has brought to Oshawa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609074">As I have just explained, as an open economy, Canada benefits from international trade and investment. While we are witnessing that companies from around the world are increasingly becoming global in order to remain competitive and enhance their prospects for growth in output and employment, Canadian firms are doing the same and more so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609075">Over the years, increases in merger and acquisition activity have led to concerns about the hollowing out of Canada's corporate sector. A recent study by the Institute for Competitiveness and Prosperity looked at the number of Canadian globally competitive companies present in Canada in 1985 and the number we had in 2006. The study showed that we had 33 global leaders in 1985. The list included firms like Hiram Walker, Northern Telecom, Canada Malting and Bombardier, to name a few. If Canada is being hollowed out, one would expect that the number of such firms would have declined but the number of Canadian-owned globally competitive firms had grown to 72 by 2006, more than twice as many as we had in 1985. Firms added to the list include Research in Motion, Magna and MacDonald Dettwiler, firms that are recognized as world leaders today. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="609076">In fact, the report shows that Canada is growing globally competitive firms at a rate that exceeds the rate of foreign acquisitions. Based on this analysis, the institute has concluded that Canada is clearly not being hollowed out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609077">The findings of the institute's study are consistent with an earlier study by Statistics Canada. Statistics Canada analyzed trends in the number of head offices and head office employment in Canada between 1999 and 2005. It also finds little evidence that Canada is being hollowed out. In fact the report shows that the number of head offices in Canada and the amount of head office employment actually grew and that foreign controlled firms were the dominant force are driving this growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609078">The report concludes that the effect of foreign ownership has not been to reduce the number of head offices in Canada, nor head office employment. As a result of foreign investment, more new head offices were created than lost and employment in head offices was as high after the merger or acquisition than had occurred before. In view of these facts, it is difficult to argue that foreign ownership of Canadian firms is associated with a falling number of head offices and declining employment opportunities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609079">Recognizing the importance of international investment flows into the country, Canada has a broad framework in place to ensure the efficient flow of investment, while at the same time protecting Canadian interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609080">The Investment Canada Act is a key part of that framework. The act provides a mechanism to review significant acquisitions of Canadian businesses by non-Canadians and to determine if it will be of net benefit to Canada. I will take this opportunity to describe how the Investment Canada Act works.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609081">The administration of the act is shared between two ministers and their respective departments. The <Affiliation DbId="78766" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Heritage</Affiliation> is responsible for the review of investments involving cultural businesses and the <Affiliation DbId="78770" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> is responsible for the review of all other investments. Acquisitions are allowed only, when on balance, the transaction is likely to be of net benefit to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609082"> In making his determination, the act requires that the <Affiliation DbId="78770" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> consider the following factors: first, the effect of the investment on the level and nature of economic activity in Canada; second, the degree and significance of participation by Canadians in the Canadian business or new Canadian business; third, the effect of the investment on productivity, industrial efficiency, technological development, product innovation and product variety in Canada; fourth, the effect of the investment on competition within any industry or industries in Canada; fifth, the compatibility of the investment with national industrial economic and cultural policies, including those enunciated by a province; and sixth, the contribution of the investment to Canada's ability to compete in world markets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609083">As part of the review process, we consult with the federal government department with policy responsibility for the industy sector involved in the proposed acquisition, with the Competition Bureau and with all the provinces in which the Canadian business has substantial activities or assets. I can assure members that any investment reviews conducted under the act are done with such rigour and a view to ensuring that the interests of Canadians are promoted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609084">I will leave members with four main points today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609085"> First, the Government of Canada recognizes the importance of foreign direct investment to the continued growth and prosperity of the Canadian economy and to Canadians' standard of living.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609086"> Second, while there may be a large number of high profile Canadian firms being acquired, the act allows us to ensure that these investments are beneficial to Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609087">Third, detailed studies suggest that head office employment, particularly in foreign controlled firms rose between 1999 and 2005. FDI into Canada has been and continues to be beneficial.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609088"> Fourth, the Government of Canada is committed to ensuring that Canada continues to attract foreign investment in order to sustain economic growth and productivity.</ParaText>

The debate today is about tax fairness. We are looking at the Liberals' idea of tax fairness versus the Conservative view of tax fairness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609093">What we are looking at is closing loopholes. The Liberals may want to change the channel a little, but they cannot hide from their record.

Perhaps the Liberal member may know of a Liberal finance minister in the past who may have closed tax loopholes for ordinary Canadians, but perhaps he knows of a Liberal finance minister who did not close loopholes for his own company.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="609107">This is an issue that all of us have heard from our constituents at length. There is a big push across the country to get the Conservative government to mend its ways and reverse the devastating policy initiatives it has made since it has come into office. The Conservatives have not only affected individuals by raising taxes, particularly on the poor, but they have also negatively affected the private sector, the small to medium sized businesses. These businesses are the heart and backbone of our country. They provide the jobs that generate the tax revenues that allow any government to have the resources to deal with everything from health to education.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="609109">We all knew there were problems with income trusts. In fact, the former finance minister, who currently sits in the Liberal caucus, had put out solutions and said that we should look at this. The government today, the then opposition, castigated the Liberals for even thinking about it, saying that they would never do it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609110">As a consequence of the hand on heart promise by the Conservative <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, millions of Canadians from coast to coast put their faith in him. They thought they could trust that individual and put their hard-earned moneys into income trusts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609111">Who are these people? Many of them are grandmothers and grandfathers. They are individuals who have limited resources and require a standard and ongoing reliable source of income in order to provide for themselves in their elderly years. People with limited funds and had very little to spend put their money into income trusts based on the promise of our current <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609112">When the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> taxed income trusts, he ripped off and destroyed $25 billion of Canadians' assets, ordinary Canadians, many of whom are poor, or have limited resources or are retired. He robbed $25 billion of their hard-earned moneys, moneys in capital that they can never ever hope to recover.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609113">Imagine, if these individuals were our grandmothers, grandfathers, fathers or mothers who had their moneys robbed at one of the most sensitive times of their lives. That is what has happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609114">It has also caused companies to be open for takeover. As a result of the government's gross and irresponsible mismanagement, we have seen, through this income trust blunder, 15 takeover attempts in the last five months and another 15 strategic takeovers in critical sectors. That is a direct result of what has happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609115">We have also seen a number of other takeovers as a result of income trusts plunging in value, others coming in from outside of the country and taking these assets from Canadians. In other words, what the government has done by lying to the public is it has allowed others from outside the country to rob Canadians of their assets. That is unthinkable. Frankly, I do not know why the government does not say that it made a mistake and that it will change this, but I know it will not. I will get to that a little later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609116">On the income deductibility issue, for Canadians who are watching, it will not allow Canadian companies to be on a level playing field. Countries such as Japan and many others allow their companies to deduct interest on moneys that they borrow in order to acquire companies abroad. When our companies are deprived of doing that, we are hamstringing them and preventing them from competing with other countries globally. </ParaText>

But it does not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609118">Frankly, I do not understand why, other than to talk about how decisions are made in that caucus and how decisions are made in government today, which is vastly different from the way things were made before. In other words, we have a very small number of people in the Prime Minister's Office, including the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and a tiny number of people around him, who make all the decisions, who tell cabinet ministers what to say and what to do, and tell them what not to do and what not to say. That deprives cabinet ministers and backbench government members from being able to do their jobs and represent their constituents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609119">It prevents the bureaucracy from being able to provide the intelligent, informed, and knowledgeable opinions that they have and advice that they could give to any government regardless of stripe. The reason why this happens is that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is a follower of the political philosopher Leo Strauss from the U.S. who believes that a small number of people are predestined and predetermined to rule a country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609120">Because we have a small number of individuals doing this within the Prime Minister's Office, including the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and because this is made with a very small number of individuals without adequate checks and balances, that is why we are seeing the blunders that the government is committing today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609121">The normal checks and balances that have been there forever are now gone. Frankly, I have never seen it before, where a <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> erodes the power of the media in asking questions that are required and erodes the power of the public sector to engage not only government members but also opposition members. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609122">We as opposition members regardless of stripe are deprived and prevented from being able to access the knowledge, abilities and information from government workers in the public service. We cannot even get the briefings that we need when we need them because it is shut down by the Prime Minister's Office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609123">What does that do to democracy? It erodes the fundamental pillars that we have in our country. That hurts everybody. It hurts the government, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, opposition members, it hurts democracy and worst of all, it hurts the public, the people who rely on us to do our job for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609124">A symptom of this is the ridiculous situation that took place with Shane Doan. Why do we have issues like this coming to the forefront when we should be dealing with health care, which never comes to the forefront in the House, and yet the average wait in an emergency department now is 8 to 12 hours? The 8 to 12 hours, when one is sick in emergency, is a crisis and it should be something that the House should be dealing with, with the provinces. But do we hear about it? No, we do not hear about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609125">Do we hear about the poor? No. Why? It is because the government raised taxes on the poor. It lowered the basic personal exemption and it raised the lowest tax rate on the poor. How unthinkable is that at a time of surpluses? Why are we not dealing with issues like poverty reduction? Why are we not dealing with issues, pragmatic solutions to deal with the environmental crisis? Why are we not dealing with the aging workforce that we have? Why are we not talking about the demographic time bomb that is coming through our country like a tsunami, that is not even being addressed in the House? Why?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609126">These are the solutions that members across party lines can put their competent minds to, to deal within the interests of the public service and in the interest of the public. We have great people in our country and in the House. We have wonderful ideas in the House, outside of the House, in the public service, across our country and around the world. We could be a place in the House where we could adopt those solutions and apply those solutions in the interest of the public. Why are we not doing that?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609127">It is in part, as I said, because we have a <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and a new government that is focused on trying to win elections and not serving the public. The public service has been subsumed to private interests in the case of the government and in doing this, it has weakened everything that we wish to do, from trying to deal with proper economic solutions that it is failing at, and we have two today on income trusts and income deductibility, to social program renewal, the environment, defence and foreign policy where it is missing in action frequently. These are the issues Canadians care about. </ParaText>

The first is that we minimize the loss of savings for Canadians, we preserve the strength of the income trusts sector, we create tax fairness by eliminating any tax leakage caused by the income trusts sector, and we create tax neutrality by eliminating any incentive to convert from a corporation to an income trust purely for tax purposes. Those are the principles that underline a whole series of solutions that we put forward and the leader of the Liberal Party has articulated very clearly.</ParaText>

Also, we will avoid, we will not avoid it because the devastation and destruction has been done; however, we will somehow be able to mitigate to some small degree the devastation that the government has wrought upon our private and public sector.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="609143">Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak to this motion and about the astonishing level of incompetence in the government, mixed with equal measures of deceit and dishonesty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609144">We should have known better when the Conservatives introduced the GST decision. There is hardly an economist on the planet who thinks this was a good idea except the third rate economist who sits over there in the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s chair. How in heaven's name was it a good, sound, economic, and competent public policy to raise income taxes and lower consumption taxes?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609145">I have in my hand last year's income tax return and this year's income tax return. I was amused by how the members opposite started howling when we actually read on the T-1 that the base rate in 2005 was 15%. When we go to this year, T-1 for 2006 is up to 15.25%. Raise the income tax, lower the consumption tax, but surely that is exactly reflective of the economic incompetence of this particular government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609146">It gets worse, though. After that we had the income trust decision. After campaigning and saying, “We will not touch income trusts”, the Conservatives did a complete about-face and taxed income trusts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609147">This is really quite extraordinary because we have a dishonest decision. On its face and in its facts it is a fundamentally dishonest decision to campaign on one thing and do the opposite when one is in government. The Conservatives say that they had to do it because there was tax leakage. We asked to be shown the tax leakage and what do we get? Eighteen pages of blacked out documents. That is really very helpful. We can do an analysis on 18 pages of blacked out documents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609148">Then they get into the idiotic notion that they have put out 18 pages of blacked out documents and they ask Mr. Gordon Tait, a respected economist with BMO, if they could have their 18 pages back. How hilarious. Four months after they put the documents out, they want them back, but of course by that time, they are on billboards across the nation. In fact, the document is posted on Bank Street right at Wellington in the bus shelter. Talk about a hilarious keystone cops type of comedy over this income trust fiasco. If it was not so tragic and if it was not so costly to so many people, it would be hilarious.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609149">Then we have the budget bill. Popped into the budget bill is this thing about interest deductibility. It says the Conservatives are against tax havens and for tax fairness, and they want to make sure that everybody pays their fair share, et cetera. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609150">I just came from the finance committee. My hon. colleague was there with me. We had five witnesses, some of the most respected economists and tax experts in the country. They said that the last time the Income Tax was amended, it took 14 years of consultation by the various affected parties to amend the Income Tax Act, because there are all kinds of competing interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609151">The Conservatives said we have 81 bilateral tax treaties with other nations. We do not just drop a nuclear bomb in the middle of all of those negotiations and of that act without expecting consequences to occur. Of course, consequences have occurred. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609152">We see income trusts leaving the country in droves, and how much tax revenue will we get from them? I do not expect we will see too much if those income trusts are now sited in other jurisdictions. We lost all that tax revenue. So much for tax leakage. This is not tax leakage, it is a tax hemorrhage. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609153">Now we have basically open season on Canadian companies, which now have to compete in the marketplace. They cannot deduct their interest, but everybody else can. That just simply raised the cost of acquisition to Canadian companies. For the love of Pete, does that make any sense at all? Could we possibly think of anything more incompetent? </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="609178">Mr. Speaker, I listened intently to the hon. member's comments. Many members in the House may well remember that when the hon. member was serving as parliamentary secretary to the minister of finance in the former government he actually was out in front of his government. I believe that he believed in tax fairness, because he was on the record on several occasions as saying that the government of the day needed to move toward taxing trusts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609179">Then he was kneecapped by the then minister of finance from Wascana, who decided no, the Liberals would tax dividends instead. It did not work. They did not understand that a lot of it was foreign-held investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609180">What I would like to ask the member, since he does sit on the finance committee with me, is whether he remembers the words of the governor of the Bank of Canada, who said, “Clearly, there has been a very significant tax incentive to use the income trust form of organization in cases where this would not have been the appropriate form of organization...”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609181">Further, the Bank of Canada governor went on to say that “the tax system was actually creating inefficiencies in capital markets--inefficiencies that, over time, would lead to lower levels of investment, output and productivity”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609182">Is that what the Liberal Party is arguing for here today? Lower levels of investment, opportunity and productivity? Is that what the member is standing up for? Less tax fairness and more breaks for buddies? Why does he not believe in tax fairness?</ParaText>

It has been left to the successor Liberal government to dig out from underneath the mess, the same way that Bill Clinton in the United States had to dig out from the previous mess of the Bush administration and now is watching as the Bush administration trashes all of the good work that the Clinton administration did over the course of eight years.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="609193">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise here today to speak to this motion presented by the Liberal Party. We are talking about two issues here: interest deductibility on loans to finance foreign investments and the income trust issue. The Liberal motion addresses these two subjects, but it does not deal with tax havens, on the whole, which is unfortunate. I would point out that this is not all that surprising, considering the appalling Liberal record when it comes to tax havens. For years, they allowed companies—such as Canada Steamship Lines—to transfer back to Canada, exempt from taxation, profits earned in tax havens or quasi-tax havens such as Barbados.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609194">As for interest deductibility on foreign investments, we in the Bloc Québécois believe it is a little early to condemn the government. Indeed, we have not yet seen the details of the measure in the form of a notice of ways and means, and we have not yet seen the minister's exact position on this. The government's attitude could be criticized, however, because, once again, it has taken an amateurish and poorly thought out approach. It has unleashed what was obviously a poorly thought out decision on the markets, without having analyzed the repercussions of that decision. This is not the first time this has happened. We have seen it in the past, and it is a shame to see how sloppy this government is. We see this in other files that do not necessarily all fall under the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>. This is true of the summer career placement program, which is in a complete shambles. The organizations still do not know how much funding they will be receiving in the coming weeks, despite their urgent needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609195">Just because the government acted quickly on this matter does not mean the opposition should do the same. We do not think it is wise to condemn this initiative before we know what is to come. The issue of interest deductibility concerns us. We feel it is important for Quebec and Canadian companies to be able to remain competitive and expand abroad. However, we are also extremely concerned about any issue involving possible tax evasion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609196">We know, just as well as the government and all officials do, that this provision on interest deductibility for foreign investments is used by companies to avoid paying taxes. This is commonly known as double-dipping, in other words, a company deducts the same interest in two, and sometimes more, different jurisdictions. It pays taxes on interest income in jurisdictions with extremely low or non-existent tax rates and deducts interest income in jurisdictions where tax rates are very high, or at least higher, which is the case in Canada, for example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609197">In the Standing Committee on Finance, we are currently discussing and analyzing this issue. We believe it would be appropriate to await these results, to have the bill, the government's notice of ways and means before making a definitive statement on this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609198">As for the second part of the Liberal Party motion on income trusts, I think the Liberal Party's record, as well as the Conservative Party's, is pathetic. Unfortunately, I understand that I will not have enough time to address this second matter immediately. I am sure I will have a chance to continue after question period.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="609202">However, when it comes to making the Liberal dominated Senate more accountable, things are not going quite as well.

              <ParaText id="609236"> La Marche 2/3 is an appeal for citizen involvement. The message that these young people are sending through this walk for international solidarity should be seen as an appeal for us to join forces with them. The government should therefore seize upon this message and direct the necessary efforts and resources into making significant strides toward achieving the millennium objective of eradicating extreme poverty in the world. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="609501">Mr. Speaker, I would like to recall that I am splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="78427" Type="2">Chicoutimi—Le Fjord</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609502"> In the first part of my presentation, I talked about interest deductibility. I would now like to talk about income trusts. I was explaining how, like the Liberals in the past, the Conservatives have bungled this file. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609503"> We recall that under the Liberal Party, there were hesitations and contradictory statements by the then Minister of Finance on the future of income trusts. Would they be taxed, and how much, in the near future? There was a moratorium on income trusts, which was subsequently lifted. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609504"> In addition, an RCMP investigation was conducted further to some suspect stock market movements prior to the announcement on income trusts by the then Minister of Finance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609505"> Still, the Liberals are not the only ones to have bungled this file. The Conservative government promised at the height of the election campaign that it would never touch income trusts and would not tax them. Some investors believed the Conservative government and invested massively in this type of company, thus inflating prices accordingly. Unbeknownst to them, they were taking a huge risk since they had faith in the word of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609506"> We know what happened. Last fall the minister announced that he was going to levy a tax on income trusts, contrary to the commitment that had been made. So he reneged on his promise and cheated the investors that had trusted him, and that is what is serious.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609507"> Basically the Bloc Québécois is obviously not against the fact that the income trusts are being taxed. We think that this business model can be applied in some cases, depending on the nature of the commercial activity, but it is not always appropriate. A company must not structure itself like this for the sake of tax considerations alone. That was the problem to be dealt with. An increasing number of companies or corporations were turning themselves into income trusts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609508">This was becoming worrisome, particularly for our economy's productivity. Some companies, such as Bell and BCE, were forced to convert to income trusts to cater to their shareholders' wishes for very large profits in a very short time, even if it was not good for the company in the long term. Income trusts are required to redistribute all their profits each year, and they cannot set money aside to invest in the development and improvement of their business. In the long term, they are put at a considerable disadvantage. This must be fixed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609509">For these two reasons, we will vote against this motion. On the one hand, we have not finished examining interest deductibility, which needs some further work, and on the other hand, even if the Conservative government has betrayed investors by deceiving them into thinking it would not touch income trusts, this correction was necessary. The Bloc Québécois suggested extending the transition period to 10 years. Unfortunately, the Conservative government did not go for this proposal, which is too bad. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609510">The last reason we will not support this motion is that it does not mention tax havens. This has been a longstanding battle for the Bloc Québécois since the Liberals were in power. We remember the epic battles we led so that businesses would no longer be able to avoid paying taxes in Canada by setting up shop in Barbados and other places.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609511">Essentially, a clause in regulation 5907—if my memory serves me correctly—enabled them to bring back foreign-earned profits, tax free, even though they were not truly taxed in Barbados, where the tax rate is ridiculously low at 1% or 2% in extreme cases. We thought this was inappropriate.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="609512">Mr. Speaker, first I would like to congratulate my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="79021" Type="2">Jeanne-Le Ber</Affiliation>, for his speech. Like him, I rise today to speak to the motion tabled by the Liberal Party with regard to income trusts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609513">As pointed out by my Bloc Québécois colleagues, we supported both the ways and means motion and the 2007-08 federal budget. The latter changes the taxation of existing income trusts, which will receive the same tax treatment as corporations at the end of a four-year transition period. Furthermore, it will no longer be possible to establish new income trusts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609514">There are reasons for our support. First, we must realize why corporations register as income trusts. In the March 2007-08 federal budget, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> indicated that, year in and year out, the different levels of government lost $400 million in revenue because of income trusts. And this was before companies such as Bell and Telus announced that they would convert to income trusts which, in and of itself, would have inflated tax losses to about $1 billion annually. This measure, which has allowed corporations to avoid paying significant amounts of tax, had to be eliminated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609515">Furthermore, the income trust structure practically forces a company to pay 100% of its profits to its shareholders at the end of the year. Although the shareholders are the main beneficiaries of this measure, it has a negative impact on the economy. If the company retains part of the profits for an investment project, for instance, it must pay the maximum amount of taxes on that non-distributed revenue. This is why, in addition to the tax losses associated with the conversion of a growing number of income trusts for reasons that are strictly tax motivated, we must also look at the potential loss of productivity in our businesses, in the context of a serious productivity crisis in the manufacturing sector of Quebec and Canada. Between 2005 and 2006, Canada dropped from seventh place to tenth place in the world, according to the <I>World Competitiveness Yearbook 2007</I>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609516">Over the past few months, thousands of investors have been pressuring members of Parliament to reverse this decision. I am sure we have all met citizens who have come to us to tell their stories. In my riding, some of my constituents told me that the drop in the stock market cost them thousands of dollars. During the last election campaign, the Conservative Party promised not to touch income trusts. Investors trusted that party, trusted the government, and either kept such investments or acquired more, which meant that those investments became even more attractive and we saw an artificial inflation of the price. The Conservative government is therefore partially responsible, because it deceived thousands of investors during the last election campaign.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609517">The Bloc Québécois supports this decision, but deplores the Conservatives' lack of honesty during the last election.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="20">(1520)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="609518">It goes without saying that steps had to be taken to eliminate the corporate practice of converting to income trusts in order to avoid paying taxes. Until now, only shareholders were taxed on dividends, not the trust itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609519">I also want to mention the importance of keeping campaign promises to voters. A promise made to the people is sacred and must be respected. During the election campaign, the Conservatives had two options. They could easily have said that they would make changes once in power, or they could have avoided creating false hope by saying nothing about it. In other words, they should have stuck to what was in place and made a decision at the right time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609520">In 2006, companies that decided to convert to income trusts accounted for $70 billion worth of market capitalization, and that is not including telecommunications giants BCE and Telus, which also planned to convert.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609521">Canada has about 250 income trusts worth about $200 billion in sectors ranging from real estate, oil and gas and telecommunications to food processing and manufacturing. The income trust craze was getting so big that it was endangering the national economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609522">Again yesterday, the Bloc Québécois issued a news release demanding the elimination of tax havens. My colleague talked briefly about tax havens earlier. It would have been nice to see some steps taken against these tax havens, which are causing Canada to lose billions of dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609523">Given that some companies are taking advantage of interest deductibility to deduct interest charges in a number of jurisdictions, which is a form of tax evasion, and given that the Bloc Québécois is strongly opposed to tax evasion and the use of tax havens, we cannot support this motion. We will vote against the Liberal Party's motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609524">Let us not forget that the bill concerning interest deductibility will be studied in committee, and that the Standing Committee on Finance will have an opportunity to submit its recommendations. Everyone will have the opportunity to suggest solutions to this problem during committee meetings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609525">The Bloc Québécois is very concerned about the increase in tax evasion in Canada. Canadian investments in tax havens between 1990 and 2003 soared, reached unprecedented levels, increased considerably. Canadian corporations invested large and growing amounts in countries recognized as offshore financial centres, particularly in the Caribbean. Assets held by the financial sector have practically increased tenfold, rising from $8 billion in 1990 to $72 billion in 2003. Barbados, where Canadian corporations operate 1,700 subsidiaries, is ranked the third most popular destination for Canadian capital abroad, after the United States and Great Britain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609526">Bill <Document DbId="2801101" Type="3">C-52</Document> which is presently being studied by the House, amends the tax treatment of income trusts in order to eliminate the advantage of this entity over a corporation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="25">(1525)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="609527">The Bloc Québécois has been giving thought to the issue of income trusts for a few years. We do not want income trusts to be abolished. One solution might be to introduce a minimum tax on income trust profits rather than preventing corporations from establishing themselves as income trusts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609528">With this bill, the government will impose a 21% tax for 2007 and will add 13% in subsequent years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609529">In closing, we will vote against the Liberal Party motion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="609530">Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to my colleague's speech and also the question that he raised about the obligation of telling the voters where one really stands on an issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609531"> I think it is germane to this discussion, because what we are talking about is something that was unsustainable. The income trust bubble created by the Liberals was unsustainable. Yes, corporations have an obligation to give dividends to their investors, but they also have an obligation to reinvest in their business and in the economy and they have an obligation to pay taxes. What we had was a situation where some of our top economic drivers in the country were being turned into a feeding frenzy for dividend investors. These were not sustainable in the long term.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609532">The member for <Affiliation DbId="78924" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation> was one of the biggest promoters of this bubble that grew. The Conservative Party said it would support that bubble, but at the end of the day, as all bubbles do, it burst. I would suggest that perhaps the biggest burst was the credibility of the member for Wascana, which is why I think the Liberal Party is so adamant about dragging back this issue and trying to reclaim losses that cannot be recovered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609533">The fact of the matter is that this issue should never have been allowed to get this far. I would ask the member what he thinks about an economic policy, which seems to be driven by the Liberals and the Conservatives, to go for short term vote gains at the expense of a long term, holistic vision of building a national economy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="609535">However, we deplore the Conservatives' attitude during the last election campaign, when they informed Canadian and Quebec citizens that they would not intervene in income trusts. When they came into power, they did indeed intervene. This prompted a certain attitude in investors. Some had bought more, believing that the government would not interfere.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="609537">Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask my colleague whether he agrees or disagrees with the large philosophical thrust of his party versus ours. I believe he would have to agree that the 12 years of fiscal management by the previous Liberal government were extremely well done. That led the country to its first series of surpluses and what I think is the longest series of surpluses ever seen in the history of our nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609538">Would the member share with me a great concern over the competence of the current Conservative government in the case of the income trusts? Obviously he is not going to support the motion, but could he explain why he then would support a decision by the government to break a promise that has led to a record number of takeovers by large foreign corporations, mostly American? These are takeovers of some very important energy and other income trusts in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609539">At the same time, the Conservative government is proposing, although now it is backtracking, to eliminate the interest deductibility for loans for foreign investments.

              <ParaText id="609543">The misguided policies of the Conservative government, especially its finance minister, are making it increasingly difficult for Canadian businesses to succeed internationally. At the same time, Canadian companies are now particularly vulnerable to foreign takeover as a result of this government's income trust policy and, more recently, the wrong-footed corporate non-deductibility of interest proposal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609544">The Conservative industry and finance ministers stand by as strategic Canadian corporate icons are swallowed up by interests outside our borders. The worst is yet to come. Energy and other natural resource companies are special targets of private equity players awash with cash and of companies in emerging economies seeking more control over their commodity supply chain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609545">Already the list of recent foreign takeovers is staggering: Inco, Falconbridge, IPSCO, Dofasco, Algoma Steel, Fairmont Hotels, Labatt, CN, Four Seasons Hotels, and Hudson's Bay. Hudson's Bay is the oldest commercial corporation in North America. It received its royal charter in 1670 to develop the fur trade in Canada and it is now in the hands of outside interests. Canadian corporate icons Bell Canada Enterprises and Alcan are also in play as foreign takeover targets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609546">What does the Conservative government do? Nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609547">The Conservatives stand by and rubber stamp the takeovers, using the toothless provisions of the Investment Canada Act.

              <ParaText id="609553">What should we do about this hollowing out of corporate Canada? Our Liberal government in the last Parliament introduced changes to the Investment Canada Act to give more power to the federal government to reject unwanted takeovers. This bill died on the order paper because of the January 2006 election and this Conservative government has not reintroduced similar legislation. This is not surprising at all, given the laissez faire attitude of the current <Affiliation DbId="78770" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation> and this government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609554"> I have great faith in the markets, but markets alone do not always respond in ways that are beneficial to Canadians. That is why Canadians elect members of Parliament to the House of Commons, to protect and assert their interests, not stand by and watch while our national assets are being eroded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609555">In my view we should amend the Investment Canada Act and replace the current net benefit test with a national interest test, or at the very least, with a national security test. There are many countries that already have such criteria. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609556">Companies wishing to acquire a corporation in the United Kingdom must demonstrate that the transaction is in the public interest. In Japan foreign takeovers are reviewed to ensure that they do not pose any public security, public order or public safety threats and that they do not have the potential to adversely influence the national economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609557">Not surprisingly, foreign takeovers of strategic assets in countries like China, Mexico, Russia and India are difficult, if not impossible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609558">In Australia, a takeover must prove to the satisfaction of the Australian government that the proposed acquisition is in Australia's national interest. In Australia, national interest is considered in relation to the widely held concerns of Australians, its laws and policies, national security interests and economic development. In my view, Australia's approach to defining the national interest is a sound one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609559">Some argue that the national interest or public interest tests discourage foreign direct investment. We need to encourage, not discourage investments by foreign interests in Canada. I agree with that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609560">Let us look for a moment at the experience in Australia. Although it seldom occurs, Australia has used the national interest test to block large scale foreign investment. For example, in 2001, the Australian government rejected an attempt by Shell Oil in a hostile takeover bid for an Australian energy company, Woodside Petroleum Limited. This $10 billion Australian bid was rejected on the grounds that Shell would operate the company as part of its global portfolio and not in the best interests of the company itself. Does this sound familiar? Have we had similar concerns? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609561">Following the decision by the Australian government, while there were market reactions in the short term, the impact was short lived. Foreign direct investment into Australia has grown from $9 billion U.S. in 2001 to $58 billion U.S. in 2004.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="609562">If we moved to a national interest test for foreign takeovers, how should we define this? As I mentioned earlier, I believe the Australian model is a good one. National interests need to be defined, as best one can, by policy, by regulation and with guidelines. We should have a debate around this in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609563">In my judgment, Canadian companies that are of strategic importance to Canada because of their size and reach, companies that are focused on the development and environmentally sound exploitation of our natural resources, and Canada’s energy assets should be subject to careful review and protected from foreign acquisition. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="609564">If Canada adopts a national interest test for foreign takeovers, will this impact on the ability of Canadian companies to grow and expand internationally? Not in the least, I submit. These Canadian companies will still have to meet the test imposed by those countries in which the acquisition target is located. How can there be retaliation when so many jurisdictions have national interest or national security tests of their own?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609565">What will slow down international expansion is the rules the government has brought in on the non-deductibility of interest and also on the income trusts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609566">We must stand up for Canada. Where non-Canadian companies wish to acquire Canadian companies, it is often quite obvious what their agenda is. The question for us as parliamentarians to consider is, what is Canada's agenda, what is in our national interest? We cannot avoid this question. It is time to act. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="609567">Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to the fascinating pitch the member made. About halfway through I found my feet were starting to get wet and then I had to start tucking my pant legs into my socks because of the crocodile tears that were spilling over on the floor of Parliament from the member.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609568">When I hear him talk about the toothless revisions of the Investment Canada Act, I am astounded. Of the 11,000 sell-offs of Canadian corporations that happened, under which party did they happen? They happened under that toothless party, the Liberal Party of Canada. That party stood by and told us that we did not need national protection, that we did not need a national standard. The Liberals stood back and allowed a massive sell-off of so much of our corporate sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609569">To come in the House today and to have the gall to stand up and say that the sell-offs of Falconbridge, Inco and Abitibi and other main Canadian companies are somehow due to income trusts is not only an abuse of the facts, but it is selling the intelligence of the Canadian people short. Canadians well remember that it was the member's party, when it was in government, that did nothing about toughening up the Competition Act and allowed so many of these sell-offs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609570">It was his party, under his <Affiliation DbId="78571" Type="2">prime minister</Affiliation>, that created the concept of the flags of convenience.

              <ParaText id="609573">With respect to what he said, he perhaps was not listening to what I said earlier. It was our government that brought in legislation to change the provisions of the Investment Canada Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609574">Maybe the member does not read the newspapers, but I certainly do and I think many colleagues in this House do. We have seen the recent spate of takeovers. Those takeovers are a result of a number of things. They are a result of the fact that there are many private equity players awash with cash. It is a fact that it is a global economy. I do not think that should say that we stand back. It is time for us to reassess our Investment Canada Act and the criteria that we use. There are many countries that have a public interest test or a national interest test. It is time that we began to look at that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609575">Regarding the member's question about the tax havens, in this House I think there is a lot of misinformation that is being promoted. The member for <Affiliation DbId="78395" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> perhaps does not fully understand business economics, but the reality is that those in the international shipping business have to base themselves offshore. They have to have a flag of convenience or they simply cannot compete.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609576"> It is the same with respect to the non-deductibility of interest. Even though we might argue in this House that it is not a very wise policy, the reality is that if Canadian companies want to bid on companies abroad, that is what they are up against. They are up against companies that can deduct interest for the acquisition of companies abroad. We need to get a little bit of reality into the discussion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="609577">Mr. Speaker, I listened to the Liberal member give a selective history on the whole issue of protection for foreign takeover of our economy. I wonder if he could address the question so we are clear about this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609578">I believe he was correct when he said, but maybe I have misinterpreted, that it was in fact the previous Conservative government that took the teeth out of some of our important legislation that would have made it possible to put to the test the question of national interest in our own economy before approving foreign takeovers of some of our major industries. I believe that occurred in the mid-1980s. Perhaps the member could confirm that. I think the unanswered question is really what happened since it was recognized by then that what was effectively happening was that there was a bean counter just counting the numbers of takeovers, with no opportunity to stand up against our national economy being hollowed out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609579">The Liberals came to power in 1993, and if I am not mistaken, on the eve of an election suddenly wakened to the fact that we needed to have such legislation in place.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="609583">Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to speak to this motion because what we are addressing concerns an issue that is of crucial importance in my riding of Newton—North Delta. It is the issue of income trusts. There is no other issue on which I have received more phone calls, letters and e-mails from my constituents. I do not know how many times I have heard from them. Many voted Conservative and not Liberal in the last election and said that the government they voted for is not the one that would have reversed its position on this. If it did, my constituents would never have given it their conditional trust, never mind the responsibility to handle income trusts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609584">Because of the volume of complaints I received, I decided to hold a town hall meeting for those who had lost so much of their hard-earned savings. I listened and could not believe all I was hearing. These are ordinary Canadians who do not speak from positions of great wealth. Many are not in their peak earning years any more. Many cannot even dream of making up half of what they lost because of this decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609585">I sat down with them in the town hall meeting and we talked about the real costs of this decision. We know the numbers: an estimated $25 billion, an average of $25,000 for each Canadian. However, the numbers are just the facts. They do not tell the story. They are too abstract. One cannot understand these losses until one actually sits down with some of the people who have suffered from this decision, but talking and consulting with the Canadian public does not seem to be a core strength of the government to begin with. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609586">One gentleman, Mr. Maurice Bouchard, was one of the Canadians who based his retirement plans on an investment portfolio that included income trusts. He is 60 years old. He has a mortgage and four children, one who has lost his chance to own a home because of this meanspirited decision by the government. Mr. Bouchard did not expect to be in this position. He has worked hard all his life. He has paid his taxes. He has been an active member of the community in Newton—North Delta. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609587">Here in Ottawa where it is all about numbers on the books, we could use some of his clarity. For him it is very simple. He stated, “How can I tell anyone, my kids or grandchildren, that the high morality of one's word as a promise is still the foundation of our society...when our political leader of the day breaks his own word for no good reason?” That is a very good question. It is the one I cannot see the government answering any time soon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609588">It is not just those who are planning their retirement who were hit hard by this decision. I also received an e-mail from Mr. Bouchard's son. He is 23 years old, just starting out in life. He has worked hard doing overtime in labour jobs, rarely making more than $13 per hour. This young man, Mr. Mark Bouchard, does not want to be a millionaire. He just wants what so many other Canadians want. He wants to own a home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609589">Of course, the government might not pay much attention to the property prices in my riding of Newton—North Delta, but let me make it simple. This young man put his savings for a home into income trusts. Those savings are gone now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609590">All I can say is that I wish the Conservatives had the wisdom to speak to ordinary Canadians like the Bouchards before they made their decision. We on this side of the House know that there were better ways to manage the file. That is what this motion is all about.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="50">(1550)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="609591">We all know that the government had the opportunity with the committee process to truly listen to Canadians before it broke its promise to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609592"> I know many of the measures in Bill <Document DbId="2515623" Type="3">C-33</Document> are about tax fairness, avoiding tax havens, ensuring no Canadian has a tax advantage over another and for the principle of fairness, which is why I support the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609593">However, there is no fairness involved with this aspect of income trusts. My colleague, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78387" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation>, the finance critic who worked so hard on tax reform in his role as a minister, put it very well. He said that this was a “nuclear bomb” approach to solving this problem. There were alternatives and he clearly outlined them in his speeches here in the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609594">As for consultations, we heard about advisers on taxation but there are no better advisers on taxation than hard-working Canadian families, like the families in Newton—North Delta that were affected; families like those who spoke with me at my town hall meetings; and families like those who have written to me or phoned my office in numbers the House could not imagine. I have received more phone calls, e-mails and letters on this one issue than on any other issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609595">If the government had consulted with the business sector it would have heard the same things too. It would have heard what many people wisely predicted but has now become a reality. The income trust tax has resulted in at least 15 takeover attempts in the last five months. Interest deductibility will just make this situation worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609596">Again, the government has broken its promise to ordinary Canadians. It has mismanaged this file and it cost hard-working Canadian families over $25 million in losses in one day. We could be waiting a long time for sound fiscal management from the government, as we had strong fiscal management from the previous government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609597">Time is money. Many Canadians are now wondering what happened to the sound fiscal management that 13 years of Liberal government brought in with 8 years of balanced budgets and the best economic performance in the G-8 countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609598">It is not me who is saying this. In fact, if we go back to the <I>Economist </I> magazine, it says that Canada was one of the best countries, the second best country to Denmark, in which to invest. If we look at between 1990 and the time we left the government, Canadians were taking 11% more in their take-home pay after paying taxes. Many Canadians, like my constituents, want the old Canada back now.</ParaText>

In fact, last year, EnCana, one of our largest oil and gas companies, earned $7 billion worth of profits which it was planning on converting into an income trust. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="609601">We need to look at what the public says about this. <I>The Globe and Mail</I> said, “The Finance minister tackled a difficult issue that the Liberals could not muster the gumption to resolve”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609602">The <I>National Post</I> said, “Everyone else has gotten the message. Why haven't the Liberals?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609603">The <I>Toronto Star</I> said the same thing. In fact, the member's own finance critic said, “It was absolutely the right thing to do”. Sheila Copps and John Manley both said that the income trust decision was the right thing to do.</ParaText>

However, now he has had months and all we hear are reversals where he is saying, no, not the elimination of interest necessarily but the double deduction of interest. Next week it will be something else.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609622">I understand that on Monday he will be making a statement on this. I hope somebody is writing this one for him. I hope he has talked to people within the department. I hope he has talked to experts. I hope he is talking to the business community. I hope he is looking at what is happening in the international community, what we are competing against, what the people who are providing jobs must face day in and day out in that global business environment, and that he comes out with something that has a bit of logic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609623">We have seen a lot of this. We have seen during the campaign and the years before the campaign in my riding where they said that they would fix the problem of the Port of Digby. During the campaign, finally, we got the arbitrator's report on the Port of Digby. An arbitrator had been called in after serious allegations had been made by a member of the Conservative Party, questions that deserved to be looked at, I agree 100%, when the member from Colchester raised them, but the arbitrator came out and said that it was not the operators of the port who made the mistake, but that it was the federal government in the transfer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609624">It is true that the Liberals were in power at the time of that transfer. It was a mistake made by Transport Canada. It was previous to my being elected but it was a mistake by our government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609625">Now the Conservatives have the power. They have made the promise that they would fix it. Is has been 16 months and we have seen no action. The same lines are being furnished by that department.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609626">Then we look at income trusts. They made the promise during the campaign that it would not tax income trusts. What happens? The first thing they do is tax income trusts: $25 billion to $35 billion of savings, primarily of seniors, lost, which is an unimaginably huge amount.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609627"> However, also important is the question of the hollowing out of Canada's corporate assets. These entities do not cease to exist. The ownership changes hands. If there is no vehicle to have that ownership within Canada, the ownership ends up in other countries, which is what we are seeing. We are seeing these valuable resources go to other countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609628">There were problems with the income trusts in the way in which they were going but rather than surgically looking at the problems and fixing them, kapow, they dropped a nuclear bomb and wiped out the whole thing, except for real estate, which some of his friends must have understood because he agreed that it was a good vehicle for real estate investments and left the REITs, but they took out the other ones.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609629">When the governor of the bank was before committee he said that there was a problem with income trusts and a problem with governance but that for certain investments, for certain sectors it was the proper investment. Energy was named as one of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609630">I would like to advise the Chair that I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="78557" Type="2">Scarborough Centre</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609631">That was a fiasco with income trusts. Then we come to this famous question where we look at interest deductibily.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="609632"> I will give an example of a company that is in manufacturing in Canada, that is in the transformation of products, raw materials, to manufactured goods. Let us look, for example, at the aluminum sector. To produce aluminum there needs to be energy and raw materials. One of them is bauxite. Sometimes, as a corporation competing on the market with international corporations, subsidiaries in other countries have to be bought. Mining operations have to be opened to get the bauxite. The way to do that is to borrow money, either domestically or internationally, and that has a cost, operate those facilities, and get the product, guarantee the resources, and guarantee to be able to continue to operate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609633">If the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance's</Affiliation> budget had put this in place, and the member just mentioned it, Canadian companies would no longer be competitive. No longer could companies compete with Spanish companies, American companies and European companies. They would be out of that market. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609634">What is the only choice then? Sell the head office to a country where they can use that interest deductibility. There is no choice whatsoever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609635">I will give another example of the hollowing out. In military purchasing the Conservatives decided that to speed things up and give their chosen contractors all the work, that they would go with original equipment manufacturers, not only for the equipment, not only for the planes for example or the helicopters, but also for the in service support. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609636">That in service support is very important because that is where Canadian companies have potential. That is where we can build. That is where we can develop and that is where we can compete.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609637">I pay particular attention to I.M.P. out of Halifax, a home grown company. An immigrant came to our country and saw the potential, contracts with the military to work on Auroras, helicopters, Sea Kings, and 50% of his work is with the Canadian military. That gives him the capacity to compete internationally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609638">Out of Halifax and Quebec there are about 5,000 employees competing and selling in over seven or eight countries. He is providing about 5,000 jobs. There are a lot of people that I know who are retired military technicians. They go on to very gainful employment working for that company, creating value within Canada, competing with multinationals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609639">Now what is the situation? We have the contract, we hear, that Boeing is going to spend dollar for dollar on this contract in Canada. What the minister does not tell us is that Boeing gets to choose who it uses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609640">Imagine if I am a contractor and all of a sudden I have to go and beg rather than compete for my work with somebody who already has all the government work. He is guaranteed it. I have to go and beg for a little slice of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609641">I would imagine that if that contractor is bidding against me in international markets that he is going to tell me that if I am going to get that work then do not bid against him on the international market. If I bid then I will be squeezed out of the Canadian market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609642">What is the result of that? Compound that with the ITAR rules that tells this employer who he can hire, what information he can have, and what data he can have. Then what happens to this company? There is no choice but to sell outside of Canada, to sell to another company. This is another example of hollowing out our Canadian assets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609643">I am not one of those economic nationalists who will say that we have to have all sorts of rules to make sure that nobody can compete to own Canadian companies. I believe that, given the right set of circumstances and a level playing field, our Canadian companies can compete in the world. We can buyout in other nations. We can compete with everybody. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609644">But if we look at income trusts and if we look at OEM and ISS, and if we look now at interest deductibility, we are tilting the playing field away from Canadian companies. We are removing their competitiveness and all of a sudden they have no choice but to sell.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609645">How can we ask these Canadian companies and shareholders within Canadian companies, to risk all the capital, the pensions, the future pensions of these shareholders who are the workers in our communities, and to risk everything to compete in a market where they are disadvantaged? I certainly hope that on Monday when the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> does another flip-flop that he falls on the proper side this time.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="609647">It is evident in the member's comments that this has happened to him because when hard-working Canadians are asked whether billion dollar corporations should be paying tax or be entitled to put their money offshore in trusts, or should be able to double-dip in terms of deductibility of their investment, they will say, no, they are working hard enough as it is.

              <ParaText id="609656">Mr. Speaker, I am surprised that I am hearing today the Liberals talking about the hollowing out of corporate Canada when the real hollowing out happened under the income trusts. Strong corporations have a duty of course to pay out to their investors but also a duty to reinvest and to build the corporation to create more income, more jobs, and then of course part of that obligation is to pay taxes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609657">We were seeing more and more companies becoming basically a tax haven and then being eaten out from within in dividend payouts. I support all the people who invested in them because certainly they wanted a return, but the fact was that the Bank of Canada said that these were inappropriate business structures. We heard that they were often overvalued by some 40% in some cases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609658">There was $200 billion in moneys that was no longer taxable and was becoming part of the tax haven. The hollowing out happened under the whole income trusts that was supported by the former finance minister when he said he would do no such thing to deal with this massive tax loophole that was created and the Liberal Party ran on that record.</ParaText>

I do not disagree for a moment that many Canadians were very upset with the reversal of the Conservative position set out during the election with respect to income trusts. It has to be regretted that many people were harmed by that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="609715">Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78817" Type="2">St. Catharines.</Affiliation></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609716">I will start off my comments by saying I find it almost amusing to hear some of the comments coming from the members opposite, particularly the member for <Affiliation DbId="78557" Type="2">Scarborough Centre</Affiliation>, who just finished speaking. He made many comments quoting campaign commitments that this party and this government made in the last campaign with respect to income trusts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609717">He is quite right. We said that we would not tax income trusts. We ended up doing just that. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has stated publicly for the record that it was the toughest decision he ever had to make, but he also explained the reasons why. We were rapidly moving into an income trust society with the announcements from BCE and Telus that they were planning to move into income trusts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609718">What the member for <Affiliation DbId="78557" Type="2">Scarborough Centre</Affiliation> continued to say, and the example he tried to present, that once we make a commitment, we cannot, come hell or high water, go back on that commitment. He used example after example. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609719">I am confused. I remember back prior to the 2006 election when the former finance minister, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78924" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation>, mused out loud whether the government at the time, the former Liberal government, would want to tax income trusts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609720">We all know the story. The markets went crazy. Insiders on Bay Street seemed to profit from his announcement. He finally came back and, in my opinion, due to a lack of political courage, made the statement, “We will not tax income trusts”. It was a commitment. Yet now, in the motion before the House, the official opposition is talking about a 10% tax on income trusts, not the 31.5% tax that we had said, which would level the playing field between trusts and other corporations. The Liberals are saying that they would tax it 10%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609721">The member may not be in a position to answer this question. How do we square that circle? On the one hand he is accusing the government of breaking a commitment that he says should be firm and cast in stone, not to tax income trusts. Yet the Liberals made the same commitment, but now they are saying that they will tax it at 10% only.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609722">Are the Liberals breaking a commitment by degree? Are they suggesting that perhaps on the one hand the government of the day, because the Liberals happen to be in political opposition, cannot break a commitment, but they can, that it is okay as long as it is less than the taxation system the Conservatives want? It does not make any sense. He is saying a commitment is a commitment, yet with the Liberals apparently a commitment is not a commitment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609723">We have seen this act before. I have seen this movie many times before, flip-flop after flip-flop. We see it continually in the House every time we seem to have a controversial vote. The opinions and the position that the Liberals took when they were in government is contrary to the position they are now taking as the official opposition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609724">A case in point is the recent Bloc Québécois private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="2169666" Type="4">C-257,</Document>, which dealt with replacement worker legislation. This type of private member's bill, this initiative, has been before the House over the past number of years at least 11 times. When the Liberal party was in power, when it was the government of the day, every time that private member's bill, or that suggestion came forward to ban replacement workers, that party opposed it, vehemently, vigorously and without question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609725">However, now that the Liberals are in opposition, they support it. In fact, even though Bill <Document DbId="2169666" Type="4">C-257,</Document> was defeated, a Liberal backbencher is now introducing yet another private member's bill calling on the ban of replacement workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609726">For anyone on the Liberal side of the House to suggest that this government has a problem honouring its commitments, I suggest they take a good hard look in the mirror. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609727">It is not just Bill <Document DbId="2169666" Type="4">C-257.</Document> We have seen time and time again the <Affiliation DbId="105458" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>, since he has been elected leader of the Liberal Party, continually change his opinion on very important matters.

I think we have established that. Of course the members opposite do not want to hear this and I do not blame them for not wanting to hear it. If I were in their position, I would not want to hear this story again either, but Canadians do want to hear it, so let me go back to the point I was attempting to make.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609734">The <Affiliation DbId="105458" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> is flip-flopping on positions. The point I am making is that if he flip-flops in the examples I am about to give, how can we count on him to be sincere in the motion the Liberals have brought before the House today? Clearly we cannot.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609735">On Kyoto, we do have the quotes. The leader of the official opposition has stated that we cannot make our Kyoto targets. He is on the record as stating that. He was the environment minister in the previous Liberal government and he has stated on the record that we cannot meet our Kyoto targets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609736">What do we hear today? Time and time again, criticisms are leveled at this government for what the opposition leader says is a failure to meet the Kyoto targets, the very targets the <Affiliation DbId="105458" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> said he could not make. He could not meet those targets by 2012. How can we believe anything the Leader of the Opposition says?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609737">Let us turn to economic matters. That may be a little closer to the heart of this issue that we are debating today. There is still a credibility gap when it comes to members of the opposition. Again, we can point first and foremost to the leader of the official opposition, who has stated on more than one occasion that he did not believe there was anything such as a fiscal imbalance. He did not believe, for example, that there was anything called a fiscal imbalance, yet when we introduced measures in the last budget to fix the fiscal imbalance between the federal government and the provinces, all we heard was criticism from members opposite.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609738">We can talk about things like the equalization formula, on which the Liberal leader has stated that, first, he believes in a fiscal cap. He believes sincerely that no province that receives equalization payments should end up in a fiscal position with a fiscal capacity higher than that of a province that pays into the equalization formula. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609739">That is exactly what we did: we put a cap on to prevent that very thing from happening. Yet what do we hear from members of the opposition? Criticism. They say this is a betrayal of our position. There is no betrayal. We are doing what is fair, what is just, and what is in the best interests of all Canadians, yet members opposite criticize it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609740">We also have examples in regard to my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78924" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation>, who, when he was minister of finance in the former Liberal government, stated, he did not believe that there was any fiscal imbalance in this country. He also stated that he was not in a position to remove non-renewable natural resources from the equalization formula, nor would he agree to. In fact, for 13 years, the last three in which he was minister of finance for this country, the Liberals did nothing to deal with the equalization formula.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609741">True, they gave, and again, it is about credibility: the Liberals say one thing when they are in government and another when they are in opposition. How can we believe anything they say now? How can Canadians believe anything they say now? That is why for any motion this government brings, whether it be on income trusts, fiscal caps or the environment, how can one believe anything the Liberals say because of the fact they have changed their position so many times in the past?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609742">Let me conclude by saying that what we have done with our position on tax havens and double-dipping is to ensure that there is a level of tax fairness for all Canadians. Once again, this goes back to the flip-flop and members opposite, such as the member for <Affiliation DbId="78387" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation>, who has stated he believes there should be no double-dipping. He believes there should be a crackdown on tax havens. Yet day after day in this House in question period, the same member stands up and criticizes the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> for doing the very thing which he advocated. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609743">That party has no credibility on any issues and particularly on this motion, and that is why I will be voting against it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="609751">Mr. Speaker, there are two issues that my hon. colleague brought forward. Let me deal with them both.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609752"> First, he talks about income trusts. I will go back to the example I used during my initial presentation. On the one hand the hon. member is saying that all Canadians should be critical of the Conservative government because the Conservatives said during the campaign that they would not tax income trusts and now they have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609753">Yet after the former minister of finance said, “I will not tax income trusts”, the Liberals are coming forward with a proposal to tax them. How do we square that circle? How can they be critical of a government because it decided to tax income trusts when they themselves are saying that very thing?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609754">With respect to the second question my hon. colleague had on tax havens and double-dipping, what the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> has said and continues to say daily is very clear. He wants to be in a position to offer tax fairness to all Canadians. To do that, he has to ensure, and I think all Canadians would agree with him, that everyone, including corporations, is on a level playing field when it comes to paying taxes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609755">He is talking merely about eliminating double-dipping and eliminating tax havens, a position which the former revenue minister in the Liberal government agrees with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609756"> How can those members be against tax fairness? How can anyone disagree with a position that makes sure all corporations pay their fair share of taxes? Their position makes no sense.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="609757">Mr. Speaker, I followed closely the comments by the member from, I believe, Edmonton—Strathcona.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609758"> Before I put a question to the member, I want to acknowledge, if I am not ruled out of order for doing so, that one of the really vocal and articulate critics of the flawed decision of a previous Liberal government to gut the Foreign Investment Review Agency was in fact our current Deputy Speaker, the member for <Affiliation DbId="81494" Type="96">Elmwood—Transcona</Affiliation>, who of course was previously the member from Winnipeg--Birds Hill.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="609760">Also, there are the numbers of Canadian businesses that are indeed increasingly vulnerable to foreign takeover.

              <ParaText id="609761">The Conservative member on the government side has been rejecting the central proposition of the motion before us, which is that the increasing vulnerability of Canadian businesses to foreign takeovers is a result of the income trust tax decision.

I was challenged earlier by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78557" Type="2">Scarborough Centre</Affiliation> to come up with where specifically in the red book it said that the GST would be scrapped.

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">A Liberal government will replace the GST with a system that generates equivalent revenues, is fairer to consumers and to small business, minimizes disruption to small business, and promotes federal-provincial fiscal cooperation and harmonization.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609768">It is on the record. The member for <Affiliation DbId="78557" Type="2">Scarborough Centre</Affiliation> challenged me. I think I am up to the challenge, so we will see if the member for Scarborough Centre is prepared, based on the fact that it is in the red book, to step down from his seat and run again like he said he would. I am looking forward to it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609769">I would like also to focus my remarks on the portion of today's motion dealing with the deeply flawed Liberal alternative to the government's tax fairness plan, an alternative aptly described by Finn Poschmann of the C.D. Howe Institute as politically funky stew, and elaborate on the extensive tax relief our government has provided to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609770">The chief deficiency with the Liberals' alternative plan is that it completely fails to level the playing field between income trusts and corporations. The Liberals would completely ignore the tax revenue losses experienced by the federal and provincial governments, nor would they remove the tax incentive for business and investors to choose the income trust structure over corporate structure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609771">On October 31, 2006 Canada's new government announced its tax fairness plan. Unlike this motion, it will restore balance and fairness to the federal tax system by creating a level playing field between income trusts and corporations and also deliver over $1 billion of new tax relief annually for Canadians, especially our seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609772">Included in the measures in the tax fairness plan is a distribution tax on distributions from publicly traded income trusts and limited partnerships. Distributions of existing income trusts will not be affected, I repeat, not be affected, by this tax for four years. Also included is a reduction of one-half percentage point in the general corporate income tax rate as of January 2011. At that point in time, the federal general corporate income tax rate will be 18.5%, which makes us the third lowest in the G-7. There is an increase in the age credit amount by $1,000, from $4,066 to $5,066, effective January 1, 2006. The $1,000 increase in the age credit amount will provide tax relief to low and middle income seniors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609773">For many, pension splitting beginning in 2007 is also in the plan. The pension income splitting measures will allow residents who receive income that qualifies for the pension income tax credit to allocate up to one-half of that income to their spouse or common law partner, thereby significantly reducing the tax on that income. The pension income splitting measure is a move that will directly benefit many of the 20,000 seniors in my riding of St. Catharines, and will benefit thousands more across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609774">The government is committed to tax fairness in this country. It is only right that businesses and individuals in Canada each pay their fair share of tax. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609775">Had the government not acted on the income trust issue, the tax burden would have been unfairly shifted on to the backs of hard-working individuals and families in our country. Our government could not stand by and watch this happen. Ordinary taxpayers needed to be protected. That is why we acted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609776">Informed opinion from coast to coast has been overwhelmingly in our favour. The federal <I>Daily Gleaner</I> said, “It was the decision we think that will benefit Canadians in the long run”. The Montreal <I> Gazette</I> called it sound public policy, noting that unlike the former Liberal government, we had the discipline to avoid public dithering. The <I>Toronto Star</I> said that the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> deserves much credit for doing the right thing by plugging a tax avoidance loophole that he rightly described as a very bad thing for Canada. The <I>Winnipeg Sun</I> said that the Conservative government acted in the best interest of the economy going forward.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="609777">Even the Liberal finance critic, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78387" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation>, said at the time that it was absolutely the right thing to do, to ensure tax fairness and to work for Canada's productivity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609778">Unlike the Liberal leader, most Canadians clearly get it. In order for Canada to compete and be a leader in the 21st century, we must have a fair and neutral tax system in which all individuals and businesses pay their fair share.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609779">Canada's new government demonstrated its commitment to tax fairness in this country in its most recent budget. The 2007 budget invests in things that make Canada great and reflect the values and beliefs that define us as a nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609780">The government is taking important steps to clean up our environment, invest in Canadians, improve our health care system and celebrate our culture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609781">Canada's new government came into power believing strongly that Canadians pay too much tax. That is why in budget 2007 our government took steps to reduce the tax burden on Canadians and provide over $7 billion in tax relief over the next two fiscal years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609782">The tax relief provided in budget 2007 builds on the already significant tax relief that the government provided in budget 2006 in which 29 tax reductions amounting to almost $20 billion over two years were made. Budget 2006 provided more tax relief than four previous federal budgets combined.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609783">Canada's new government has also introduced advantage Canada. A key element of the plan is to provide a tax back guarantee to Canadians by dedicating all interest savings from reducing the federal debt to personal income tax reductions. It means that every dollar saved from lower interest payments will be returned to Canadians through personal income tax reductions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609784">Over the next two fiscal years this will mean $2.4 billion in tax relief. It is made possible by lowering our national mortgage by over $22 billion since being elected, debt reduction that works out to more than $700 per Canadian. After all, why should Canadians not benefit directly from living in the only G-7 nation with a balanced budget?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609785">Here are a few examples of how the government is acting to help hard-working Canadians and businesses: </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609786">We are introducing a $2,000 per child tax credit that will help families get ahead. For a typical family with two children, it will mean up to $620 in tax savings. This tax credit will help alleviate some of the necessary expenses incurred by Canadian families in raising children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609787">We are increasing the spousal and other amounts to provide up to $209 of tax relief for a spouse or a single taxpayer supporting a dependent child or relative. We are giving all families the opportunity to enjoy the dignity that comes with having a job and the pride of independence through the working income tax benefit. It will reward and strengthen incentives to work for more than 1.2 million low income Canadians. The maximum benefit is $500 for individuals and $1,000 for families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609788">We are reducing the federal paper burden for business by 20% by November 2008, by reducing the number of annual tax filings and remittances by over 350,000 small businesses. We are recognizing that businesses need modern technology to be more efficient and buildings that allow them to grow. That is why we proposed changes to the capital cost allowance system that will shorten the writeoff period for computers and non-residential buildings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609789">Budget 2007 also contains a detailed plan creating a Canadian advantage in global capital markets that will create a stronger and more efficient capital market in our country. The plan will give enterprises of all sizes better access to capital at more competitive costs, provide investors with increased investment choices and create more highly skilled, well paying jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609790">Canada certainly recognizes that attracting investment is as basic to building a strong economy as reducing government debt, lowering taxes and maintaining low, stable and predictable inflation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609791">Make no mistake that the decision that was taken on October 31 is all about fairness. It is about fairness to Canadian taxpayers and their families who would have been asked to pay more and more. It is about fairness within the corporate sector by removing the tax distortion in favour of income trusts relative to corporations. It is about fairness for all Canadian governments, federal and provincial, by preventing a significant loss of tax revenue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609792">In summary, it was clear that income trusts had special tax advantages that regular business corporations did not. Although the decision to act on this income trust issue was not an easy one, it was absolutely necessary for the country and for the future generations of Canadians, our children and our grandchildren.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="609808">Mr. Speaker, if things get really desperate, I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="78591" Type="2">Brant</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609809">These are issues of huge importance that we are dealing with today. Sometimes in the cut and thrust of debate and repartee, I am sure Canadians wonder just what the point is that we are trying to make. I want to try to make a balanced commentary on what has been proposed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609810">Every Conservative member who spoke has emphasized how important it is to get the capital regime in place that fits right within the global economy. That is based on the ever-pressing assumption that within the global economy the movement of capital is absolutely fundamental to the health and welfare of a modern global economy, of which Canada, Europe, Japan and China are a part. In a competitive world, all those that we are in competition with to add value to our economy need to get the capital regime in place that will add value to our economies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609811">The proof of that is that every member has addressed part of that regime. One cannot talk about the accelerated capital tax write-off for capital equipment without relating that to what value it adds in a competitive regime. It would add nothing if every country with a modern economy did exactly that, so it needs to be more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609812">In global capital markets, it is important that we have a free trade approach to the investment through securities. The government has indicated that it is moving in that direction. If every modern economy did that, that alone would not give Canada the competitive edge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609813">We can talk about a global commercial strategy with respect to breaking down cross-border tariffs and so on. Again, that alone would not give Canada the competitive edge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609814">The bottom line is that what will give Canada the competitive edge is to have something more that makes Canadian investments both in Canada and abroad more attractive in a competitive global world. That, in turn, will add jobs, which means that we can reinvest in our health care system and produce a civil society that has a quality of life that we want for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609815">I do not want Canadians who are still watching, if, indeed, they ever were watching this particular cut and thrust of debate, although I am sure many are, to conclude that it is an either/or, that they must take the Conservative government position or the Liberal position, because the nature of the motion is to ask for sober second thought. Given the commentary with respect to interest deductibility, for example, and the implications that are being drawn, is it time to take a step back and re-evaluate that particular policy?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609816">When the C.D. Howe Institute comes forward and says that the proposed changes in the Canadian tax system could place Canadian companies at a significant disadvantage both abroad and even in Canada in competing with its foreign counterparts, one cannot just slough it off as being irrelevant. When KPMG comes forward and says that more foreign takeovers of Canadian companies stifle Canadian investment in global markets and an exodus of head offices and a weaker Canadian economy overall will occur, we cannot say that is a one-sided commentary or a partisan shot at the government. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="609817">We could also quote from KPMG on interest deductibility. It states:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609818">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">This is just disastrous and disables all businesses who wish to expand in a foreign jurisdiction, because they cannot borrow money outside and deduct interest on that money. It means everyone must rearrange their affairs and set up a U.S. subsidiary, which costs more money.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609819">We cannot take that commentary and just say that it is totally irrelevant to this debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609820">The nature of the global economy is one of an integrated economy. We used to have a subsidiary economy based on U.S. and multinationals. Now investment is going every way. We just had an example of that on the financial page of today's <I>Globe and Mail</I> where it was being cited that Magna was looking for a Russian investor.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609821">When we talk about integrated investment, if we have a company that is active in China, that company in turn invests through Canadian capital in operations in Canada and employs people. It is a check and balance on foreign exploitation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609822">We cannot just simply take a partisan perspective on this and say that the government is all wrong and the opposition is all right. What we can say is that given what we understand of the movement of capital and the fact of where barriers are placed in stopping capital from moving in a liquid fashion, there is no question that Canadian companies and Canadian society will suffer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609823">The general bottom line of those experts is what this side has said to the government, through this motion, that we should have another look at what we are doing with respect to interest deductibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609824">I will not make comments on income trusts but there are similar comments that can be made in terms of process. I am focusing more on interest deductibility because there is a huge body of opinion that is saying to the government that this is a time to take a step back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609825"> I think the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> himself is coming to the conclusion that once we can get past the issues related to double-dipping and using straw horse investment facades behind which corporate tax returns can be fudged, we should put in a regime that will protect Canadians against that kind of exploitation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609826">However, once we have done that then we need to get to the essential issue of what this is doing as a mechanism that undermines investment and high value added activity that will benefit Canadians. That is the message that the opposition is trying to give the government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="609844">Mr. Speaker, my thanks to the chief government whip as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609845">On November 16, 2006, I tabled the motion we are debating today, calling for a national water strategy. A little after that time, a couple of other similar motions appeared on the order paper by two other colleagues, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78691" Type="2">Parkdale—High Park</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="78928" Type="2">Nanaimo—Cowichan</Affiliation>. Their motions will be up for debate at a later date, and I very much hope to participate in those debates.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609846">On March 19, the government appeared to react to the pressure by parliamentarians, and perhaps by the growing awareness among the Canadian public, of water as a vital resource by including a quick reference in its second budget to its intention to undertake certain expenditures in the area of water management. Let us hope the government's new-found interest in water is more real and convincing than its confused, halting and highly criticized, both inside and outside Canada, approach to climate change, an issue, incidentally, that has a profound impact on water quality and quantity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609847">I have my doubts, though, because the current federal cabinet includes three former ministers from the former Harris government in Ontario, a government well known for having been in charge in Ontario at the time of the Walkerton water tragedy. It was a government that made serious cuts to the environment ministry in that province, cuts that contributed, according to the report of the O'Connor inquiry, to the tragedy itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609848">Water is an essential resource. It is so vital to our human existence that it is impossible to claim that a country has a real and effective environmental policy if it is not properly and comprehensively addressing the issue of water. So vital is water to human existence that it is not possible to say that a nation is committed to the values of equity and equality if it is not properly and comprehensively addressing the issue of water. Water is ubiquitous. It is everywhere and its management falls under many jurisdictions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609849">It is an issue that has multiple sub-issues in multiple jurisdictions. Water has many aspects. As I said, it is consumed as a good and it is also essential to economic prosperity. It is visible in lakes and streams, but also invisible in aquifers and underground streams and rivers. It can inspire science and scientific research, but it can also provoke conflict. Water, therefore, is complex and far-reaching and requires a broad and comprehensive approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609850">Because it is such an important issue, because it is so complex, a national water strategy must rest on the democratic principle of consultation, which is why in the body of my motion I mentioned that any future water strategy should be developed in consultation with different levels of government, with local citizens groups and so on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609851">I can obviously not address the entire breadth of this issue in 15 minutes. I will only really be dealing with the tip of the iceberg of this complex, detailed and multi-faceted issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609852">The first thing I will address is the myth about water in Canada. This myth is that Canada is to water what Kuwait is to oil. In other words, we have such a huge overabundance of water that perhaps we do not need to take the issue that seriously. However, if we are to have an effective policy, we cannot rest that policy on misconceptions and false assumptions. Therefore, I will set the record straight on the overabundance of water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609853">First, on the demand side, Canadians per capita are among the highest consumers of water in the world. There are great demand pressures on our water resources.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="609854">Let us look at the supply side. The volume of water sitting in lakes in Canada is at least 20% of the volume of freshwater in the world. That sounds very impressive. It makes it sound as though we have a huge abundance of water. However, we need to clarify our terminology.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609855">The first thing we need to do is to distinguish between what might be called water capital and water interest, to use a financial or accounting analogy. This distinction is vital to our understanding of the degree to which our actions as consumers, as businesses and as policy-makers may be depleting our water resources beyond recovery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609856">For example, the water sitting in our lakes might be considered our stock of water, our water capital. In other words, it can only be used once. Once that water is used, it is depleted and it can never be recovered. The rivers and streams that run into and out of our lakes, including the Great Lakes, are like our water interest or dividends. These rivers and streams and their flow represent net additions to the water supply. They represent the renewable portion of the water supply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609857">It is the volume of the water dividends, the volume of the flow that matters, since this is the portion that can be used on an ongoing basis without depleting the resource base or the capital stock of water. The volume of the flow is what is known as the renewable water supply. It is interesting to note in this regard that the total volume of water in all the freshwater lakes of the world is only equal to about two year's worth of the runoff of the world's rivers. That helps to make the stark contrast between water capital and water interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609858">The two countries with the largest renewable water supplies, and one of them is not Canada as is commonly assumed, are Brazil with 12.4% of the world's renewable water supply and Russia with 10%. Below that Canada is in a virtual four-way tie with Indonesia, the <?bk?>U.S.<?ek?> and China. In fact, Canada has only about 7% of the global renewable water supply. Interestingly enough, much of that supply does not flow to populated areas. It flows north of the population centres in southern Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609859">This is a vital issue and we have not as a federal government and as a nation as a whole been addressing it properly. If we look at a recent report on water management by the Senate standing committee on energy, environment and natural resources, the committee described the state of water management at the federal level in Canada as shocking and unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609860">I have heard other statistics, such as Canada is 26th out of 28 countries in the developed world in terms of managing our water resources. That includes our drinking water resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609861">As the motion essentially alludes to, I believe governments should respect their constitutional jurisdictions. This does not mean the federal government must be a bystander or a passive observer. It does not mean the federal government must step back or wilt in some way. The federal government has a role to play in water management in Canada. It has a right to be involved, even though water is a natural resource and provinces have jurisdiction over their natural resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609862">There are some areas where the federal government has a direct and a constitutional responsibility and authority. For example, the federal government has jurisdiction over international treaties and interprovincial issues. It has jurisdiction over navigable waters and fisheries, water on airplanes and water on aboriginal reserves. In a more indirect way it has jurisdiction, upheld by the Supreme Court, of toxic substances which leach into our water supply. There are many hooks on which a national water strategy could rest.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="609863">I will turn now to drinking water. To give the House a sense of the situation with respect to drinking water in Canada, Canada is one of the most developed countries in the world and we still have problems with drinking water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609864">New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador and Quebec, particularly rural Quebec, continue to lag behind in maintaining even the minimum federal guidelines for water quality. Many small communities continue to this day to have to boil their water for everyday use. Families in every region of the country are boiling their water daily because they cannot get clean drinking water into their homes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609865">In British Columbia the Sierra Legal Defence Fund issued a report entitled “WATERED DOWN”, concerning 28 waterborne disease outbreaks in 2003. It estimated that at any given moment as much as 10% of B.C.'s water systems should be under a boil water advisory.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609866">In 2002 Manitoba passed a drinking water act. Since then, it has discovered in Winnipeg that concentrations of disinfectant byproducts considered carcinogenic could be located in the Winnipeg drinking water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609867">In Portage la Prairie lead concentrates exceeded Canada's guidelines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609868"> Let us talk a bit about the federal role in terms of drinking water before I wrap up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609869"> There are drinking water guidelines in Canada and they were created through a joint federal-provincial-territorial committee on drinking water. In 2005 Canada's Commissioner on the Environment and Sustainable Development, who audited the process the federal government uses to develop these guidelines, found a significant backlog of about 10 years in updating them, despite Health Canada's recommendation that they should take no more than two or three years to develop or review. The commissioner found that many known contaminants were not even listed in the guidelines because of the time lag in updating them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609870"> There is a problem here and it is very important that the federal government show some leadership in terms of marshalling the energies of all the stakeholders in this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609871">I appreciate the opportunity to debate the motion. I hope to continue to delve into the issue in greater detail in the second hour of debate.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="609877">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in the House to address Motion No. <Document DbId="2504279" Type="57">249</Document>, introduced by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78807" Type="2">Lac-Saint-Louis</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609878">We all know that water is perhaps one of the most valuable natural resources. It is essential to life. It is critical to the health and well-being of Canadians. It is critical to aquatic systems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609879"> It is also vital for economic prosperity across sectors such as agriculture, oil, gas and shipping. That is why it is also important to this government's environmental agenda, which includes conservation of species and spaces, clean air and climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609880">In dealing with one of our most precious resources, Motion No. <Document DbId="2504279" Type="57">249</Document> calls on the federal government to immediately develop, in consultation with the provinces, territories, aboriginal groups, municipalities, local community organizations and others, an integrated water resources management strategy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609881">The main focus of this motion is to advance the concept of integrated water resources management to measure, monitor and protect freshwater. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609882">After examining this motion and its implications, the point that I would like to address is that much of the spirit and substance of this motion is already being implemented by the federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609883">For example, integrated water resources management is a water management approach that advocates decision making based on engaging stakeholders and incorporating ecological, social and economic considerations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609884">As well, the global water partnership sponsored by the United Nations development program advocates an integrated water resources management based on principles of openness, transparency, inclusion of stakeholders, accountability, responsiveness, efficiency and equality. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609885">These are principles that Canada is already using to help guide integrated water resources management approaches here in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609886">As a matter of fact, Canada has been taking an integrated water resources management approach for many years. We have already adjusted our thinking. We have created new tools for the job. We have put these tools to work in a wide range of integrated water resources management initiatives across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609887">Integration is happening at many levels. Our work on water is bringing together provincial and territorial governments, aboriginal peoples and stakeholders, municipalities, industry, energy, agriculture, non-governmental organizations, community groups and research teams.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609888">This government is also working toward effective planning and decision making on water management through partnerships.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609889">The fact is that collaborative water management is a cornerstone of integrated watershed management. This means that stakeholders need to be actively involved in water management decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609890">We are continuing our work to put in place inclusive and transparent coordination mechanisms that will allow us to widen the application of this broad principle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609891">In fact, if we look at the 1987 federal water policy that was passed by former prime minister Brian Mulroney's Conservative government, we will see that this policy calls for integrated water management planning. It also calls on the federal government to achieve this through its programs, policies and laws. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609892">So for 20 years we have had a federal water policy that is already consistent with integrated water resources management, and all the actions proposed in Motion No. <Document DbId="2504279" Type="57">249</Document> have already been captured in the policy's five strategies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609893"> As well, the federal water policy is a statement of our government's goals for Canada's freshwater resources. Today, this government is on track toward achieving those goals. This year alone, we announced $4.5 billion in new spending on the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609894"> This includes the national water strategy, where we have invested $35 million on freshwater initiatives: $11 million over two years for cleaning up Great Lakes areas of concern; $5 million over two years for the International Joint Commission to study Great Lakes water levels; $12 million over two years to support the cleanup of Lake Simcoe; and $7 million over two years for the cleanup of Lake Winnipeg.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="609895">Our national water strategy also supports healthy oceans by investing $382 million for conservation and protection of fisheries and ocean habitats.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609896">Budget 2007 also includes a long term infrastructure plan that will help support investments by provinces, territories and municipalities to improve water and waste water infrastructure, including treatment facilities, sewage collection and water distribution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609897"> Our government will be pursuing these budget initiatives in an open and consultative manner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609898">As for the federal, provincial and territorial jurisdictions, this government recognizes their responsibilities with respect to water delivery. We consistently favour a collaborative approach that is respectful of the roles and responsibilities of each order of government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609899"> Fortunately, the provinces and territories also recognize the need for collaboration and an integrated approach to water management. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609900">Our mutual understanding of the need for collaboration is important, because the reality is that the provincial and territorial governments are responsible for many aspects of land use planning and development that impact water quality and availability. Many provinces are demonstrating their commitment to this approach by introducing new policies and legislation that moves toward integrated collaborative approaches.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609901">For example, the province of Alberta's new water for life strategy introduces a transition from traditional water management planning for water allocation issues to integrated watershed management planning supported by a shared governance model. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609902">Ontario is moving forward with a comprehensive approach to protecting sources of drinking water. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609903">The Quebec water policy is based on full integration of the different aspects of water management by adopting an integrated watershed management approach relying on citizen involvement, integrated management of the St. Lawrence River and recognition of water as an integral part of the collective heritage of the citizens of Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609904">There is no doubt that many Canadian jurisdictions are using integrated water resources management to guide their central water management approach. Considerable progress is being made in many areas and we expect this trend of policy and legislative reform to continue as jurisdictions come more fully to terms with the need to manage their water resources for economic, social and environmental reasons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609905">Federal, provincial and territorial governments are also cooperating on the national collection of water quality information through national agreements on water quality and quantity monitoring. There is movement toward integrated management with better data and information and an emphasis on clear and transparent goals and results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609906"> As well, where water management issues are a shared federal, provincial and territorial interest, the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment also provides a formal mechanism for effective intergovernmental discussion and coordinated approaches to regional and national environmental issues, including water management. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609907">The council also recently introduced national initiatives to promote drinking water protection from source to tap and options for a Canada wide strategy for managing municipal waste water effluent. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609908">Regional cooperation in water management is also achieved through bodies such as the Prairie Provinces Water Board and the Mackenzie River Basin Board. These boards ensure that interprovincial surface waters and groundwaters are equally shared by Canada's prairie provinces and they help to prevent potential conflicts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609909">When we look at all of these initiatives that are taking place, we can see there is no doubt that ensuring clean and safe water for Canadians is a joint undertaking that is being taken very seriously by municipal, provincial and federal governments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609910"> It is clear that this government is committed to collaborative, integrated management of water in partnership with these orders of government.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="609911">Mr. Speaker, I would first like to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="78807" Type="2">Lac-Saint-Louis</Affiliation> for introducing this motion, which gives the Bloc Québécois an opportunity to speak again about this major issue and express its concerns about this resource. The Bloc Québécois is very concerned about protecting water and water quality. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609912">As it is worded, the motion before us gives us a great deal of scope for debate. I could have opted to talk about drinking water, groundwater or aquifers—and my colleagues may have already done so—but in light of recent events having to do with bulk sales of water, I have chosen to speak about this particular aspect of the motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609913">Recent discussions on water management, including the Calgary forum held on April 26 and 27, organized by the American CSIS, the Conference Board of Canada and Mexico's CIDE, have renewed fears about massive water exports. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609914">I have received many comments from people in my riding and elsewhere and from environmental and other organizations. Without exception, these individuals and groups have serious concerns about what could become of the water in Quebec and Canada. To the vast majority of the people I represent, the crux of the matter is that our water is a very important resource that must be protected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609915">I would like to quickly review the division of powers with respect to water in Canada, to clarify what we are debating today for the people who are watching. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609916">As the parliamentary secretary explained, the federal government has very limited powers over water. They extend to shipping, fisheries and the powers the federal government exercises as the trustee of the first nations and the owner of certain lands. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609917">Section 132 of the BNA Act gives the federal government the power to implement the Boundary Waters Treaty signed by England in 1909 on behalf of the empire. However, it cannot go beyond the treaty provisions, because it would be interfering in the jurisdictions of the provinces, which own and manage the water. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609918">Quebec and the provinces are responsible for water. Water, as a resource, is a provincial jurisdiction. The bulk of the jurisdiction over water belongs to the provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609919">Under the Constitution, they have ownership of lands, including the waters, and have the right to administer or use them as they see fit. They have the exclusive right to regulate municipal facilities, including their drinking water distribution system. They have exclusive jurisdiction over the “development, conservation and management of sites and facilities in the province for the generation and production of electrical energy”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609920">The Constitution also gives the provinces exclusive jurisdiction over the “development, conservation and management of non-renewable natural resources and forestry resources in the province”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609921">As such, Quebec already has its own water resources protection system. When André Boisclair was environment minister, he provided Quebec with a water policy in 2002.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609922">This policy already implements the objectives proposed in the Liberal motion, namely: ensure the protection of this unique resource; manage water with a view to sustainable development; better protect public health and ecosystems. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609923">With this policy, Quebec wanted to recognize water as a valuable asset of Quebec society and reaffirm that water is an integral part of Quebec's collective heritage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609924">By giving water this special status, the Quebec government took on the responsibility of regulating water use, establishing priority uses and preserving water quality and quantity, while taking the public interest into account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609925">Quebec has a real legislative framework to ensure the protection and quality of its water resources, whether for human consumption or activities involving contact with water such as swimming and water sports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609926">The Government of Quebec tightened its standards by adopting the Regulation respecting the quality of drinking water and the Regulation respecting groundwater catchment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609927">The Liberal motion before us would simply duplicate what is already being done by the players who truly control the resource.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="609928">Let us now consider the commercial aspect of water issues. In response to a series of questions the Bloc Québécois raised in the House of Commons over the past few weeks, the government said that NAFTA does not restrict our ability to protect our water resources. However, the situation is not that clear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609929">Currently, NAFTA applies to all trading among the three North American countries, with a number of exceptions, including hydroelectricity, military equipment, and so on. Unless a commodity is specifically excluded from NAFTA by means of an exception under chapter 21 or a reservation, NAFTA applies the moment a commercial transaction is concluded. There is no formal exception or reservation for water. Therefore, we do not believe it is covered by NAFTA.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609930">Article 309 of NAFTA states that:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609931">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">—no Party may adopt or maintain any prohibition or restriction ... on the exportation or sale for export of any good destined for the territory of another Party—</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609932">The House of Commons Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade asked the Minister of International Trade for clarification in 2001. The minister's response was that “—water in its natural state ... was not included in NAFTA”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609933">Water is in its natural state when it is not being used. If a proposal to take water for export is put forward, we can no longer say that it is not being used. If a contract is signed to that effect, a commercial transaction exists and trade agreements apply. Unless a commodity is specifically excluded from NAFTA through an exception under chapter 21 or a reservation, NAFTA applies the moment a commercial transaction is concluded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609934">In the absence of an exception, it is not the nature of the commodity that determines whether it is a marketable commodity, but the existence of a commercial transaction or even a plan to commercialize the resource. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609935">In a nutshell, regardless of what the government says, water is not excluded from NAFTA.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609936">Although no government is currently planning to dispute Quebec or Canadian legislation, there is no reason to believe that that will continue to be the case once North Americans begin to feel water shortages more acutely because of over-exploitation and global warming. When that happens, it is not at all unlikely that Quebec's laws will be challenged by those wishing to take water directly from our lakes and rivers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609937">The Bloc Québécois believes that it is irresponsible to wait for this situation to arise. The federal government must initiate discussions with the Americans and the Mexicans to exclude water from NAFTA right now, before water shortages reach the crisis stage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609938">That is why the Bloc Québécois tabled a motion at the Standing Committee on International Trade formally recommending to the government that it quickly initiate talks with its Mexican and American counterparts to exclude water from the goods governed by NAFTA.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609939">Motion M-249 completely ignores this avenue, which nonetheless is the only one that will provide real protection for water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609940">I would like to conclude by briefly speaking about the discussions on water exports that were held in Calgary at the end of April.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609941">The North American Future 2025 Project is an initiative of the <?bk?>U.S.<?ek?> Centre for Strategic and International Studies. The Conference Board of Canada and its Mexican counterpart are participating in this project. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609942">The three organizations met last April and discussed the future of the North American environment, and more specifically water consumption, water transfers and the artificial diversion of bulk water, with the aim of optimizing the joint use of the available water in North America.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609943">This is very worrisome. Although the Conservative government has finally indicated that it will not participate in such discussions, the simple fact that it is not taking action to exclude water from NAFTA encourages such discussion about bulk water exports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609944">Rather than suggesting that the federal government limit itself to its own jurisdictions over boundary waters and water in native communities, or suggesting that the government adopt the only sensible solution—excluding water from NAFTA—the Liberal Party proposes to eliminate provincial jurisdiction over water and to introduce a new federal integrated strategy, even though this is a provincial jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609945">The Bloc Québécois is opposed to the principle of this motion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="609947">Water is a very precious resource. It is one of the real necessities of life. It is one that we often take for granted, but it is not always in plentiful supply. We have seen, with climate change around the world, areas of the world that are in dire need of water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609948"> In fact, we can reflect back on our own history and think of the time in the thirties in Saskatchewan when there was a real drought for a number of years. We can recall how devastating that was to the people of the prairies when that drought went on and really contributed to the whole period that we call the dirty thirties in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609949">As I said, the NDP will support this motion. I want to say that for many years New Democrats in this place before me have talked about the issue of water. I remember the member of Parliament for Kamloops who was here during the eighties and nineties, and the early part of 2000 who raised this issue repeatedly in the House of Commons, Nelson Riis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609950">We also know that there are pressures and demands for water being placed on the U.S. and that the issue of water exports is at the top of mind for many of us as Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609951">Last year I had the pleasure to attend a workshop in my community that was put on by KAIROS, which is an ecumenical, social justice movement. The people in KAIROS had been committed to social justice issues and are promoting the whole issue of water as a basic human right. That event took place at St. Laurence Anglican Church in my community and I was very pleased to participate in that. I was invited by Ross Bremner and other activists in the community. The title of their workshop last spring was “Water: Life Before Profit”, and it relates quite well to this motion, as does the work that that organization is doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609952">In the New Democratic Party election platform in 2006, we committed to laws that would crack down on big polluters and help guarantee a healthier environment for both our current generation and future generations. We said that Canada should have a clean water act to establish national standards and protection for drinking water, including those jurisdictions under federal control such as first nations communities and reserves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609953">We need federal standards for solid waste disposal, dump management, mine site operations and rehabilitation, forestry and farming practices and pesticide use.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609954">We can see again, with climate change in my province of British Columbia, the devastation that the pine beetle infestation is having on the pine forests in B.C., the significant danger of slides, and degradation of our water supplies and our rivers in British Columbia. We do not have the forests there to hold onto the soil and stop the slides from happening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609955">We need to provide infrastructure financing to provide funding for badly needed improvements to public sewers and water systems in Canada. That would make a real improvement in water quality. We have the horrible example and tragedy of Walkerton that I think brought to the front of people's minds in Canada the necessity for prevention and purity of our water, something that when I was growing up we basically took for granted. We now realize that we have to take this issue seriously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609956">In British Columbia, we have more and more boil water advisories happening all the time. In fact, in the greater Vancouver region last year we had a boil water advisory that went on for weeks, something that had been unheard of anywhere in the Vancouver region previously.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="609957">We support this motion and we want to establish a Canadian water strategy that would include federal legislation supporting pollution reduction and prevention, watershed planning, research and development, investment in water infrastructure and support for standards for safe drinking water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609958">We do support the idea that water is a public good and that it has an inherent importance to Canada's ecosystems and for future generations of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609959">The people of Canada recognize the vital importance of freshwater and are committed to its protection, its conservation and environmentally sustainable use. We also believe that we should declare water as a basic human right and work nationally and internationally to ensure action to implement this policy for all Canadians for in fact people throughout the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609960">Bulk freshwater diversions and removals from Canada will not address the future water needs of ordinary citizens elsewhere in the world and would have a potentially devastating ecological consequence for Canadians and Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609961">At the time of the debate and negotiations around NAFTA, the government of British Columbia opposed the passage of the NAFTA, in part because of the threat it proposed and still poses to democratic control over water. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609962">The B.C. government repeatedly urged the federal Liberal government to obtain a clear and definite exclusion from the NAFTA for water. Sadly and unfortunately, the Liberal government of the day did not obtain that exclusion for water. I know my colleague from the Bloc Québécois has raised that issue today in her remarks to this motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609963">She talked about the fear in Quebec that the law that the government of Quebec passed to protect water could be challenged because of NAFTA. I can tell her and people in the House that it has already happened in British Columbia. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609964">We do have in B.C. a water protection act that was passed under a New Democratic government in 1995 and a very troubling development has been the attempt by California based Sun Belt Water Inc. to seek $200 million in damages from the B.C. government. It says those are lost potential profits because of the B.C. water protection act and so it is suing and trying to get compensation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609965">If the Liberal government of the day had ensured that we had an exclusion on water of course this would not have happened. We hope that the Conservative government today will deliver on a commitment to ban freshwater exports. Where these governments have failed us in the past, this has to happen in order to ensure Canada's water supply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609966">Today we ask the government to protect our freshwater by passing federal legislation to ban water exports from Canada and to obtain an unequivocal exclusion in NAFTA for water. As I said earlier, this should have been done years ago. We want to urge the government of the day to move on that file.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609967">We oppose the deregulation and privatization of water resources. We do not support any existing or proposed trade and investment agreements that threaten our democratic control and public ownership of water in this country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="609977">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to address Motion No. 249, introduced by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78807" Type="2">Lac-Saint-Louis</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609978">Many of us here, at least those of us on this side of the House, agree that sustainable water use and management are fundamental to Canada's and the world's social, economic and ecological health. That is why water is part of this government's environmental agenda and that is why we are here today to debate Motion No. 249.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609979">Motion No. 249 calls on the federal government to “immediately develop, in consultation with the provinces, territories, Aboriginal groups, municipalities, local community organizations, and others, an integrated water resources management strategy”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609980">This motion focuses on advancing the concept of integrated water resource management to measure, monitor and protect freshwater.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609981"> Integrated water resources management is a water management approach that advocates decision making based on engaging stakeholders and incorporating ecological, social and economic considerations. It is an approach that this government is already on track with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609982">In fact, we are doing more than that. This government is making progress at advancing integrated water resources management. For example, our work on water is already bringing together provincial and territorial governments, aboriginal peoples, and stakeholders such as municipalities, industry, energy, agriculture, non-governmental organizations, community groups and research teams. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609983">Our government is also working to ensure that our plan is effective. We are working through partnerships when making water management decisions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609984">This concept has been in place for more than 20 years. In fact, the Mulroney Conservative government passed the 1987 federal water policy. The federal water policy that was introduced then called for integrated water management planning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609985"> It also called on the federal government to achieve this through its programs, policies and laws. This government has been working to make many of these principles a reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609986">The federal, provincial and territorial governments all have responsibilities when it comes to water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609987"> For example, the provincial governments are responsible for many aspects of land use planning and development that can impact water quality and availability. To fulfill these responsibilities, the provinces and territories have recently introduced a number of water policies that promote protection from source to tap as well as broader watershed management planning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609988">For the federal government, boundary and transboundary waters shared with the U.S. are areas where our federal jurisdiction is clear, so we have put in place programs to measure, monitor and protect freshwater in these areas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609989">These are areas where the jurisdictions are clear, but because we all recognize that many of these responsibilities are shared, there are also a number of integrated partnerships that already exist here in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609990"> For example, the Atlantic coastal action program and the Great Lakes 2000 program are two solid examples of integrated planning, leading edge water science and extensive partnerships. These initiatives are based on federal-provincial cooperation and extensive engagement of municipalities, NGOs, industry and citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609991">There is also the National Water Research Institute, which has led influential national assessments of current and emerging threats to water quality, water quantity, and aquatic ecosystem health for more than 30 years. As well, across our country there are many Canadian universities that are also involved in water research.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609992">There is also a federal water research agenda that identifies several priority areas for integration of federal water science carried out by many departments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609993"> That is not all. This government has taken a broad approach to the environment that covers a number of priorities such as conservation of species and spaces, clean air, climate change and, of course, water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609994">As well, this government has also made it a priority to help ensure that all first nations residents have access to safe drinking water. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609995">We are working to address the needs of communities with high risk drinking water systems by building on the plan of action for drinking water in first nations communities. We will also be basing future efforts to improve water quality on reserves on the options raised by the report of the Expert Panel on Safe Drinking Water for First Nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609996">There are many examples of cooperation on water at the national level, but this cooperation happens most significantly at the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment. We see this cooperation there because there is a formal mechanism for effective intergovernmental discussion and coordinated approaches to environmental issues, including water management, which is provided by the council.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609997">However, it does not end there. That is because, for the most part, the federal, provincial and territorial jurisdictions all recognize that there is a real need for both collaboration and an integrated approach to water management.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="609998">There are many examples of the integrated water resources management approach in practices. Federal, provincial and territorial governments regularly cooperate on the national collection of water quantity information through national agreements on water quality and quantity monitoring.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="609999">There is also a great deal of cooperation when it comes to integrated watershed management, so much so that collaborative water management has become a cornerstone of integrated watershed management requiring that stakeholders be activity involved in water management decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="610000">At the watershed level, management generally involves the local advisory board with members from provincial, territorial and local municipal governments, aboriginal peoples, industry, educational institutions, local stewardship groups, development groups, wildlife groups, environmentalists, landowners and, of course, the concerned public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="610001">There are many examples of this, such as the Fraser Basin Council, the Great Lakes action plan and the South Saskatchewan River basin. In my home province of Manitoba, the Red River Basin Coalition not only includes all of the stakeholders in Manitoba, but also stakeholders in the states of North Dakota and Minnesota, working cooperatively to address the issue of our common basin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="610002">As well, my riding includes both Lakes Winnipeg and Manitoba, some of the largest freshwater lakes in the world. Our Conservative government has taken a very proactive approach to protect these lakes and their basins by investing $7 million for the protection of the Lake Winnipeg basin and a further $450,000 to support the Lake Winnipeg Research Consortium.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="610003">There are many examples that we can look to but there is not enough time today. Rather, I invite the members of the House to look at what the government is already doing in partnership with the provinces and territories. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="610004">The government is already acting on its commitment to collaborative, integrated management of water policies and programs through action. The government is already implementing much of the spirit and the substance of the motion. We will continue to work with our partners. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="610005">We are working together with the provinces and territories to find concrete and realistic solutions to Canada's environmental challenges, which is why we introduced our turning the corner action plan last month. We are continuing to make Canada's environment a priority, not only for this government but for all our governments and our people for today and in the future.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="610008">Quebec and the provinces are already masters of their own water. Because it is a natural resource, water is under provincial jurisdiction. The basic powers pertaining to water belong to the provinces. This is set out in the Constitution, which also grants the provinces title to the land, including water, the right to administer these resources and to use them as they see fit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="610009">Thus, Quebec administers its water. Furthermore, Quebec already has its own water resources management strategy. In 2002, when he was environment minister, André Boisclair gave Quebec its policy on water. That policy covers exactly the same things as the motion. That policy already applies the objectives proposed here today, namely, to ensure the protection of the resource, to manage water with a view to sustainable development—which is even better—and to better protect public health and the health of ecosystems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="610010">The Bloc Québécois cannot vote in favour of this motion because it encroaches on an area of provincial jurisdiction.
