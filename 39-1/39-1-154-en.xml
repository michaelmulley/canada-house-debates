            <Content>
              <ParaText id="622815">Mr. Speaker, today it gives me great pleasure to speak to Bill <Document DbId="2539974" Type="3">C-40, An Act to amend the Excise Tax Act, the Excise Act, 2001 and the Air Travellers Security Charge Act and to make related amendments to other Acts</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622816">First, I would like to say that the Bloc Québécois and I will support Bill <Document DbId="2539974" Type="3">C-40</Document>, which amends various acts and breathes a little life into a number of industrial sectors and charitable organizations and lends a hand to some of society's more vulnerable members, including children and seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622817">Bill <Document DbId="2539974" Type="3">C-40</Document> includes three parts that amend three or four important acts. It will make a number of products and services tax exempt for some people and some industrial sectors, such as Quebec's wine industry, which is growing fast. This bill will offer some administrative and tax relief to these sectors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622818">The first part of Bill <Document DbId="2539974" Type="3">C-40</Document> concerns measures relating to the GST. The second proposes amendments to legislation in order to lift the tax on certain goods and services. Third, Bill C-40 sets out various measures pertaining to the excise tax on wine, beer and other spirits. Lastly, the bill contains amendments to the air travellers security charge rules.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622819">The measures in the first part of Bill <Document DbId="2539974" Type="3">C-40</Document> that relate to the GST fall into five main categories, the first being the exemption of certain health services. The second category consists of exemptions of certain services for charities, which I will talk about a bit later. The third category comprises measures pertaining to business arrangements, including arrangements for banking institutions and foreign banks that want to invest to restructure their Canadian branches or subsidiaries. The fourth category includes governmental and administrative amendments. Lastly, the process of applying the GST would not change a great deal, but significant changes would be made so as to streamline the administration of our taxation system, which is often a barrier to expansion and growth of some sectors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622820">The first area that is affected is health. The bill proposes to lift the tax on speech-pathology services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622821">My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78704" Type="2">Saint-Maurice—Champlain</Affiliation> touched on this yesterday, sharing his expertise in child psychiatry with the House of Commons. He explained that some children and groups in our society are more vulnerable than others. I am thinking about children who have serious language disorders and whose parents cannot use public services. To address their child's essential needs, they must use services other than public services. Often, GST is charged on these services, but we believe that they should be tax exempt. Such services are often expensive for needy families, but they are services the parents expect to receive. Consequently, this bill will lift the tax on speech-pathology services, which are essential to children's development.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="622822">Second, services for seniors with cardiovascular disease will be tax exempt. We know that cardiovascular disease is on the rise in Quebec, contrary to what we might have expected, because consumption of products that contribute to cardiovascular disease has decreased considerably. I am referring to smoking and drug use, among other things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622823">Nonetheless, we feel something needs to be done to alleviate the burden on seniors who are in precarious financial situations. Removing the tax from such services is as important as what is being presented in Bill <Document DbId="2539974" Type="3">C-40</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622824">Another exemption in Bill <Document DbId="2539974" Type="3">C-40</Document> has to do with social work services. Currently tax is applied directly to social work services. These services are particularly essential in areas of growing poverty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622825">In Montreal, there are so-called high-risk neighbourhoods that need essential resources and services. Unfortunately, for people in need of direct assistance—as it was called—and social support, believe it or not, these services are still being taxed. This bill proposes an exemption for these social services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622826">Nonetheless, the government could have gone further. Why stop at these exemptions? Why apply tax exemption only to speech therapy services, social work services, health services for our seniors who are experiencing cardiovascular problems? Why not extend this measure to other equally essential services? I am referring to services provided by certain health practitioners such as psychologists. If a child needs to consult a psychologist, his or her parents should not have to be taxed to use such a service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622827">We know that in our school boards there is currently a serious shortage of professionals. I am not talking about teachers, but professionals who are essential to the development of our children in our ever changing society. We must ensure that our children and youth in our schools can get the support they need. Unfortunately, limited financial resources often prevent these children from getting these services and force parents to use external services to meet essential needs. In my opinion, these services should also be tax exempt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622828">Another aspect has to do with the tax free status of certain products, specifically, the sale and imports of a product that can replace blood. Lastly, certain anti-anxiety drugs such as Valium and Ativan are also being given tax free status.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622829">Basically, this bill makes certain essential services exempt from the GST, specifically in health care. However, the government could have made an even bolder move by expanding the types of services covered by Bill <Document DbId="2539974" Type="3">C-40</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622830">Bill <Document DbId="2539974" Type="3">C-40</Document> also covers another aspect, namely, the GST rebate for motor vehicles that are specially equipped for use by individuals with disabilities. In my view, in our so-called just society that aims to give everyone equal opportunity—and Quebec society has already asserted this equal opportunity approach—people with disabilities must be given everything they need to fully integrate into Quebec society, into our society.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="622831">This mobility is crucial for people who are losing their functional independence and people with disabilities, so they may access public services. Some Canadians are confined to their homes—for all kinds of reasons, including disabilities—which limits their integration into our society. We therefore welcome this GST rebate for motor vehicles that are specially equipped for use by individuals with disabilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622832">Bill <Document DbId="2539974" Type="3">C-40</Document> covers another aspect, namely, another GST measure, this time concerning charitable organizations. As we all know, these organizations are in precarious financial situations and are often forced to organize fundraising initiatives to survive or just to maintain administrative services. This is a common problem. Lack of funding is clearly a problem for charitable organizations. Yet, they provide a great deal of support to groups that, once again, are often very vulnerable. We see these well-established charities at work in our ridings, as they solicit us every year for a little help. Unfortunately, we have no programs or financial means available to be able to help them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622833">Examining a bill like Bill <Document DbId="2539974" Type="3">C-40</Document> is a perfect opportunity for us to say yes, we can help them when it comes to taxes. We will support a bill that will exempt goods supplied with a property under short-term leases. What does that mean? It means that if a charity decides to acquire a good supplied by a property lessor in a short-term lease, this product would be exempt from GST. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622834">To repeat, this helps out these charities and lightens their financial load. At the end of the day, we are not only helping charities, but also the individuals and groups who benefit from the services offered by the non-profit organizations. We commend the measure in Bill <Document DbId="2539974" Type="3">C-40</Document> which aims to make goods supplied with a property for non-profit organizations GST-exempt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622835">The second GST measure is the transitional GST relief for a foreign bank that decides to restructure its Canadian subsidiary into a Canadian branch. We must have a better harmonized tax system. There is currently competition, which must be harmonized, particularly in terms of existing taxation in the United States. Transitional GST reliefs for the foreign banks that decide to restructure and set up shop here, in Canada, will only strengthen our financial market, our banking system, and the economies of Quebec and Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622836">The third measure is the exclusion from the GST/HST base of beverage container deposits that are refundable to the consumer. This is an interesting measure because our society has decided that sustainable development will serve as the cornerstone for its development. Such a society must encourage recycling initiatives. This is an unequivocal fact. However, although Quebeckers and Canadians have clearly affirmed their desire to focus on and accelerate the implementation of a beverage container recycling system—particularly in Quebec—there are still tax irritants, elements that prevent us from doing more in the areas of deposit-refund systems and recycling. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="622837">We must therefore make it easier to manage recycling and to exclude beverage container deposits from GST/HST. I believe that is a step in the right direction. Naturally it is not a panacea. It not enough to ensure that there will be a Quebec or Canada-wide recycling system based on a deposit refund system. However, it does remove a tax constraint and lessens the administrative burden on the application of a deposit refund system and recycling. In this regard, it is definitely a step in the right direction. It certainly will help organizations such as Recyc-Québec, which has carried out several studies and promoted this vital debate about the importance of implementing a deposit refund system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622838">There are other measures pertaining to the excise tax. I am thinking of, among others, part 2 of the bill, which amends the Excise Tax Act, 2001. Two significant changes are made by Bill <Document DbId="2539974" Type="3">C-40</Document>. First, the bill seeks to improve the operation of the excise tax and then to adjust administrative practices in order to develop and promote the growth of a certain number of industries, particularly measures pertaining to alcohol and specifically wine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622839"> The objective of Bill <Document DbId="2539974" Type="3"> C-40</Document> is to encourage the growth of the wine industry in Canada. It is not a measure that benefits only the rest of Canada; it is a measure that will also benefit Quebec. We know that there are currently 42 vineyards in Quebec. More than 1,000 hectares of vines are now under development and 300,000 bottles of wine are produced each year. That shows that there is a vibrant wine sector at work in Quebec. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622840"> The latest competitions held in Quebec and in Canada have demonstrated the strength of this sector. Last month, from April 20 to 22, an important competition known as the Coupe des Nations was held as part of the Festival de la gastronomie de Québec. Believe it or not, Quebec was one of the standouts. The Quebec vineyards really stood out. They won 34 new medals for Quebec wines. Quebec vineyards won almost 35% of the medals awarded during this festival, at which many vineyards were represented. What does that prove? It proves that there is energy at work that we must maintain and that we must strengthen in the future to ensure that these vineyards can benefit from tax breaks. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622841"> What is there in Bill <Document DbId="2539974" Type="3">C-40</Document> that will provide major benefits to this industry? It provides for deferral of tax by small vintners selling wine on consignment. They will not have to pay the GST until the product is sold. That is significant because it means that the vintners, who are very often small businesses—not even medium-sized businesses, except in very rare cases—with very limited resources at their disposal, will be able to put off an expense until the product has been sold. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622842"> Small producers will make their tax payments once the product has been sold. This will provide much more breathing room to the small vintners. In addition, our homegrown products in all regions of Quebec will certainly benefit from such a measure. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="30">(1030)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="622843"> I will close by saying that we are in favour of Bill <Document DbId="2539974" Type="3">C-40</Document>, because it gives hope to the people who are most vulnerable in our society, it ensures increased growth in some essential sectors of Quebec economic activity, and it lightens the tax burden on certain groups in our society. All of this promotes a more sustainable society that favours fairness and economic growth. </ParaText>

He also said that Bill <Document DbId="2539974" Type="3">C-40</Document> would correct certain deficiencies in these regards because the poorest people often cannot pay for these services. That is what I understood him to say, and I would appreciate it if he could explain a bit more for us. What would he think of exempting even more services or professions? </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="622847">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78704" Type="2">Saint-Maurice—Champlain</Affiliation> for his question and comments. This is a good example of the kind of social democracy we want to have in Quebec. We are a progressive political party. We on this side of the House do not think that essential services should be taxable. It is fine to tax luxury goods, but things as essential as speech language pathology services are currently subject to tax and this is contrary to the equal opportunity principles that the Government of Canada is supposed to stand for. This is why Bill <Document DbId="2539974" Type="3">C-40</Document> is helping to shed light on the situation. I was surprised to learn a few years ago—and am still surprised—that diapers for babies are taxable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622848"> Why must we tax essential goods and thereby impose an additional burden on the poorest people in society? Some industrial sectors—and I would point again to the oil, gas and hydrocarbon industry in Canada—are making fabulous profits and still get tax breaks. We pass bills here in the House to reduce the fees and taxes paid by corporations that rake in $250 million a year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622849"> It is time to exempt essential services for our children and for everyone. If we can expand the range of exempted services, that is all to the good. We will have made progress towards equal opportunity. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="622860">Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I speak at second reading of Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53, An Act to implement the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States</Document>. The convention is an international treaty establishing the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, ICSID. Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document> will implement the ICSID convention for Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622861">Allow me to give hon. members of this House, first, a description of what ICSID is, second, an overview of the bill and what it does, and lastly, an explanation of the benefits of this convention for Canada and Canadian businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622862">ICSID is an organization devoted to the resolution of international investment disputes between states and nationals of other states through arbitration and conciliation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622863">ICSID provides mechanisms for arbitration and conciliation of such disputes provided that both the state of the investor and the host state are parties to ICSID. This means that once Canada ratifies ICSID, a Canadian investor abroad in any of the 143 countries that have already ratified ICSID may have recourse to ICSID to resolve disputes that may arise with the country in which it is doing business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622864">ICSID is a highly reputable World Bank institution based in Washington, D.C., and one of the most frequently used institutions for investment arbitrations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622865"> ICSID and international investment arbitration have traditionally been used in cases of expropriation or nationalization. A hypothetical example is a takeover by a host government of a Canadian business exploiting natural resources such as oil or minerals. Such an expropriation may represent a substantial loss for the investor and fair compensation is not always easily obtained.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622866">However, the Canadian investor may have insisted on an investment agreement with an ICSID arbitration clause before investing, or Canada may have an investment treaty with the host government making reference to ICSID arbitration. If so, once Canada ratifies ICSID, the Canadian investor owning the business will have the right to use ICSID arbitration to pursue fair compensation for its losses before an independent arbitral panel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622867">ICSID provides an efficient, enforceable mechanism for such dispute resolution. This is why our government believes ICSID is a good way to protect Canadian business and its investment in foreign countries. It also complements our investment protection treaties and existing arbitration clauses in investment contracts of Canadian businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622868">Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document> will implement this convention. This bill needs to be passed before Canada can ratify the convention. This bill will make an ICSID award enforceable in a Canadian court. It will ensure that persons using conciliation under the convention cannot abuse that process. This bill also provides for governor in council appointments of persons to ICSID lists of potential panellists and it provides privileges and immunities as required by the convention. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622869">The key provision making ICSID awards enforceable is clause 8, which states:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622870">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentRest="1" IndentFirst="2">(2) The court shall on application recognize and enforce an award as if it were a final judgment of that court.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622871">This provision will apply to an ICSID award for or against Canada or a foreign government. This provision is the key to the ICSID system for enforcing arbitration awards. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622872">An ICSID award is reviewable by an ICSID tribunal, but not by national courts. Once final, an ICSID award will be recognized and enforced in Canada as if it is a final judgment of a Canadian court.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622873"> While Canada will be giving full effect to awards, in turn the convention guarantees similar enforcement in all states that are party to ICSID. Thus, Canadian businesses with an ICSID award in their favour have a very powerful tool to ensure the award is paid. This ensures the protection of their rights and interests in foreign countries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622874">There are three important related provisions. Clause 6 makes the act binding on the Crown. This ensures that awards against the federal government can be enforced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622875"> Clause 7 prevents a party from seeking court intervention by way of judicial review applications or applications to a similar effect. A party cannot therefore attack the validity of a final ICSID award.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622876">Clause 8 also gives all superior courts, including the Federal Court of Canada, jurisdiction to enforce ICSID awards. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622877">The provisions with respect to conciliation are brief. Clause 10 ensures that the ICSID conciliation process can be conducted in a manner that is without prejudice to the rights of the parties. In other words, testimony given during conciliation cannot be used in other proceedings. This gives investors a further option to ensure their rights are respected.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="622878">I should also mention that the bill proposes provisions ensuring the required privileges and immunities for the centre, its employees and its arbitrators. Such immunities guarantee the independence of the tribunal when seated in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622879">As I indicated before, once adopted, the settlement of international investment disputes act will allow Canada to ratify the ICSID Convention. In today's world, there are many situations where Canadian businesses could be significantly harmed by foreign governments' activities or decisions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622880">Canadian businesses are increasingly active in foreign markets. They invest in foreign countries by buying plants, establishing new businesses or acquiring rights to natural resources, for example. While disputes with foreign governments affect only a small portion of the $465 billion in assets owned by Canadian investors abroad, when disputes do arise, mechanisms such as ICSID are necessary to ensure that the dispute is resolved fairly and efficiently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622881">We as a government have worked hard to promote Canada abroad, facilitate the free flow of international investment and help Canadian businesses succeed abroad. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622882">To date, Canada has negotiated 22 foreign investment protection and promotion agreements, or FIPAs, and is actively negotiating others. These agreements provide for investor state dispute settlement by means of arbitrations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622883"> ICSID arbitration is an option under these agreements but only if both countries are party to ICSID. These agreements create a more predictable and transparent climate for Canadian investors abroad by setting out rules for the treatment of investors and offering dispute settlement to adjudicate claims when their rights have been violated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622884">Canadian investors who need to use dispute settlement to enforce their rights, whether those rights exist pursuant to a FIPA, an FTA or an investment contract with an arbitration clause will welcome this bill. Promoting fair trade rules and equitable treatment for our businesses must go hand in hand with efficient dispute resolution mechanisms that allow investors to obtain redress.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622885">We have proposed this bill today to pave the way for ratification of the ICSID Convention. Canadian businesses demand that Canada join this important convention to ensure protection of their investments abroad and because it is consistent with our foreign trade investment policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622886">This convention entered into force in 1966, over 40 years ago, and 143 states have ratified the convention, including most of our major trading partners. This represents virtually three-quarters of all the states in the world. By way of comparison, there are 191 states that are members of the UN. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622887">The ICSID Convention represents one of the most ratified treaties in the world and Canada is not yet a party to it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622888">This government is committed to fair international trade rules. We are committed to protecting Canadians' interest throughout the world and this is why we take action today for the implementation of the ICSID Convention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622889">Canadian businesses support the adoption of this convention. The convention is good for investment in this country, as well as Canadian investors abroad. It ensures efficient resolution of disputes between governments and foreign investors.

              <ParaText id="622890">Mr. Speaker, it sounds like a good idea to ratify this convention with Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document>. I initially think, of course, of Canadian oil companies in a country like Venezuela, for example, where Mr. Chavez has gone on a rampant nationalization program. I am not sure if we have Canadian companies in Venezuela but I think it would be a good thing to be part of that if the compensation is fair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622891">However, another thought occurs to me. What would happen if foreign countries, through state-owned enterprises, were to come to Canada to try to nationalize some of our energy assets or some of our national resource companies? What comes to mind is the case of China Minmetals, a state-owned enterprise in the People's Republic of China, that made a proposed takeover bid of Noranda but which did not proceed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622892">With the failed policies of the government with respect to energy trusts and with respect to the non-deductibility of interest, many energy and natural resource companies will become subject to takeovers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622893">The more preferred way, certainly from my perspective, would be to make changes to the Investment Canada Act so that the government would need to deal with these in terms of the national interest. However, the government has been totally silent on that issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622894">Will this convention at least help with the nationalization of Canadian companies by foreign and state-owned enterprises?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="622895">Mr. Speaker, to be truthful, the question is irrelevant to the bill that we are discussing today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622896">I will say that Canada respects its international obligations. This bill does underscore that Canada is open for business but we have always respected our international obligations. When the Government of Canada has been at fault with a foreign investor, we have always lived up to our obligations so it will not change anything. What it will do is protect our businesses abroad. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622897">I have a couple of very important supportive, positive quotes for Canada ratifying this convention, which I would like to read for the hon. member. The first one is by Michael Murphy, the executive vice-president for policy, from the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. He states, “For Canadian businesses investing abroad, ratifying the ICSID Convention is an effective way for the Government of Canada to provide these investors with a means of protecting their investment: an efficient avenue for seeking a remedy should their investment be compromised”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622898">He also said that “Canadian businesses investing abroad would finally be afforded the same level of protection as our competitors. In addition, ratification of the ICSID Convention would enable the Government of Canada to conclude its foreign investment and protection agreement for the negotiations with China much sooner, allowing the government to produce real benefits for Canadian businesses”--</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="622905">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53, An Act to implement the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622906">The convention is also known as the ICSID Convention. We are renowned in the House for using acronyms but it is far simpler to use that when we are referring to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes established by the convention. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622907">I was first made aware of ICSID by a constituent of mine, a Mr. David Haigh, an internationally renowned dispute settlement arbitrator and a lawyer with Burnet, Duckworth and Palmer in Calgary, who has long advocated for Canada to bring ICSID into force. This gentlemen brought this to my attention back in my dark days when I was in opposition. We tried at that time to bring it forward at that time but were unsuccessful. However, now that we have a new government in this country we are actually able to get on with creating a business environment that is friendly to businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622908">I know that David, along with many Canadian investors, will be pleased that the government is moving forward with Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document>, and it is my pleasure to take part in the debate today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622909">Before a country can ratify the ICSID Convention, it needs to pass legislation providing for ICSID awards to be enforceable in its courts. For Canada, this means that it must pass and bring the act into force. In addition, any province or territory that is designated a constituent subdivision must bring similar legislation into force.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622910">I would first like to discuss some of the pressing reasons for hastening Canada's ratification of the convention. I hesitate to use “hasten” because, as my hon. colleague just raised, we have been working on this since 1966.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622911">There are three reasons why Canada should become a party to the ICSID Convention. It would provide additional protection to Canadian investors abroad by allowing them to have recourse to ICSID arbitration in their contracts with foreign states. It would also allow investors of Canada and foreign investors in Canada to bring investment claims under ICSID arbitral rules where such clauses are contained in our foreign investment protection agreements and free trade agreements. Also, it would contribute to reinforcing Canada's image as an investment friendly country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622912">I will tell the House more about the other advantages. When Canada ratifies the ICSID Convention, Canadian businesses investing abroad would finally be afforded the same level of protection as their competitors. There are numerous disadvantages associated with the absence of Canada from this convention. Canadian businesses are hurt. Even though Canadian investment abroad continues to rise, the ability of Canadian businesses to arbitrate investor state disputes is hurt by the fact that they must arbitrate without the infrastructure that ICSID would and could afford them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622913">Investors prefer ICSID to other arbitration mechanisms for many reasons, such as: the ICSID regime is an extremely efficient mechanism for the resolution of investment disputes; it provides better guarantees regarding enforcement of awards and more limited local court intervention; and ICSID's roster of arbitrators gives investors access to well-qualified arbitrators at ICSID at controlled rates and with extensive experience in international investment arbitration. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622914">Since Canada has not ratified ICSID Convention, we are not granted a voice on ICSID's administrative council and cannot vote on changes to the ICSID arbitral rules.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622915">I will turn now to the second advantage of ICSID: improving the dispute settlement process available under our treaties. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622916">NAFTA and Canada's foreign investment protection agreements, or FIPAs, provide for ICSID dispute settlement as one of several options. However, up to now this option could not be used. Ratification of ICSID will provide investors with the option to use ICSID to resolve certain investor state disputes.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="55">(1055)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="622917">Chapter 11 of NAFTA provides that ICSID arbitrations may be used in cases where both the state of the complaining investor and the state complained against are party to ICSID. The U.S. is party to ICSID but not Mexico.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622918">In the case of FIPA, most of our FIPA partners are already party to the ICSID convention. Consequently, when Canada ratifies the ICSID convention, arbitration using ICSID will become available under those agreements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622919">My final point is a simple one. Canada's absence from ICSID does little to augment our international image as a country which is open to free trade and foreign investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622920">Already, as earlier mentioned, 143 countries are party to ICSID. It is time for Canada as well to become a party to ICSID. I will now explain why ratification is increasingly urgent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622921">First, we do not know when an investment dispute might arise in which Canadian membership in ICSID might be an important factor in preserving a Canadian investor's rights. Periodically, and again this year, we have been approached by investors who could have benefited significantly if Canada had already ratified the convention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622922">Second, some states that have ratified ICSID restrict enforcement of investor state arbitral awards unless such awards are made by an ICSID tribunal. It is difficult to persuade such a state to modify this practice when a solution is as simple as Canadian ratification of ICSID. Yet, until there is a solution, Canadian investors lack the protection provided by the availability of effective investor state dispute settlement mechanisms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622923">The Canadian business and legal communities support Canada's ratification of the ICSID convention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622924">The provinces and territories support ICSID. The convention allows Canada to designate provinces or territories as constituent subdivisions that will also be able to use the ICSID arbitration for disputes with international investors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622925">The Chamber of Commerce passed a policy resolution unanimously. Over 200 local chambers of commerce from coast to coast, at their AGM in September of 2006, passed a resolution which calls on the Government of Canada to ratify this convention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622926">I urge the House to listen to the call of Canada's investors, legal community and constituents like Mr. Haigh, and give expedient consideration to the bill in the interests of Canada's continuing international stature and healthy economy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="622927">Mr. Speaker, I was really struck by something that the hon. member said in reference to reinforcing Canada's image abroad and making indeed Canada an investment friendly country and giving a positive image to the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622928">As a member of a government that inherited a $42 billion deficit that we had to eliminate; that provided Canadians with the largest tax cut in Canadian history of $100 billion, both personal as well as corporate; and that made investments in R and D and innovation, it really gave an image to the world that in fact Canada was no longer a country threatened by the IMF knocking on its doorstep but was rather a country that was able to have great economic growth through the wise investments that were made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622929">While I of course support the principle of the bill, I do want to express, after conversations with individuals particularly in the business community, a concern I have about recent measures taken by the government. It relates to, for example, the tax on income trusts. How does that bring greater confidence to the investment markets, not to mention the issue of interest deductibility?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622930">While this measure that we are talking about today is indeed a positive measure, I must say that we as a country and the Conservative government need to be aware of the fact that these types of measures will not give confidence to foreigners to look at Canada as a friendly investment place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622931">There has to be greater consistency. I am just wondering whether or not the hon. member shares the concern that I have on income trusts, the billions of dollars that seniors lost as well as the issue of interest deductibility that really hinders Canadian companies to further expand in a world that is truly globalized.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="622942">Should this bill pass, it will bring Canada one step closer to becoming a signatory country of the 1965 World Bank convention on the settlement of investment disputes. The convention is designed to facilitate the settlement of investment disputes between governments and foreign investors, thereby improving the conditions for international investment, which is what has been discussed today and certainly has been reflected in the questions that hon. members have posed to the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622943">Any such disputes are argued before a tribunal at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes or ICSID, as members have been referring to it. Canada signed the treaty last December in Washington and in so doing, as has been mentioned, became the 143rd country in the world to sign on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622944">It will not come into effect until all the provincial and territorial governments have also signed on. Five have already done that, including Ontario in 1999. It is my understanding and the government's representation that the remaining provinces and territories have expressed approval in principle and interest, and are hopefully going to be signing in the near future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622945">Essentially, what the ICSID convention does is ensure that the domestic courts and any of the signatory countries have the power to enforce any arbitration amounts awarded by this tribunal. Although agreeing to the hearings is voluntary on the part of each party, once they have agreed to a hearing neither one can unilaterally withdraw from the process or refuse to pay any damages awarded by the tribunal. </ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622950">With regard to the last part of that quote, the Conservative government has kept itself very busy over the past year doing just the opposite and in fact tarnishing Canada's investment image abroad. The most glaring example was the broken promise on income trusts. This particular event caused the largest meltdown in the financial markets in the history of Canada. There was $25 billion of investment value wiped out by a broken promise. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622951">To remind members, it was the promise of the government not to tax income trusts. In fact, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself said that the greatest fraud is a promise not kept. That promise was not kept to Canadians. During the election campaign the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said that he will never, never, never tax income trusts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622952">That gave assurances to the marketplace and particularly seniors, 70% of whom do not have defined pension benefit plans and, as a consequence, were looking for investment instruments that would emulate a pension plan, and that was income trusts. That meant that they could receive regular cashflows from these investments in income trusts to pay their bills. On Halloween of last year, $25 billion worth of wealth was wiped out simply by that broken promise. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="05">(1105)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="622953">This has to do with the credibility of Canada. It has to do with foreign and bilateral investment. Investors feel secure dealing with a country when they know the rules of the game and they know they are not going to be arbitrarily changed at the whim of a government for whatever reason.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622954">I had the opportunity to participate in the public hearings before the finance committee. It was clear that foreign investment issues were very key in this regard. The change of the rules of the game in the middle of the program had damaged the credibility of Canada in terms of foreign investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622955">There is no question that there will be more on this subject. Over 2 million Canadians are very angry with the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622956">The finance committee heard from some of the seniors. Some members would say that they were paper losses. However, that is like me saying I paid $50,000 for my house, which is now worth $300,000. However, if my property taxes go up 31% and my house value goes down that is okay because I still have the $50,000 value or more than that. The appreciation in the house price is not a paper gain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622957">Anyone who held an income trust lost that kind of money. One of my own constituents lost $125,000. An 82-year-old veteran has no way of recouping that lost investment value. The credibility of the financial markets of Canada is extremely important in terms of foreign investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622958">There is also another angle to this issue that has not been discussed as much in the House. I am speaking of the damage that has been done to Canada's international reputation as a safe place to invest. In the weeks following the announcement many investors were likening Canada's Conservative government to a banana republic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622959">I realize the term “banana republic” gets thrown around a bit. If we take the time to consider it in this instance, there are some striking parallels. The term is considered to have been coined to describe Honduras in the late 19th century and the early 20th century. At that time the Honduran government was eager to encourage as much foreign investment as possible in its agricultural sector in the hopes of improving the nation's overall economy. In particular, the government sought out investment in its burgeoning banana sector and in new railroads to support that growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622960"> In 1893, in order to protect local farmers, the government unveiled a new tax on banana exports that caught all those foreign investors off guard. It was the new 2¢ tax levied on every banana exported from the country. That would be almost 50¢ per banana in terms of 2007 dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622961">Needless to say, investors, particularly American investors who had invested millions of dollars in the industry under one set of rules, were not very happy when the Honduran government changed the rules in mid-game. It is exactly what I described with regard to the income trust decision in Canada, a broken promise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622962">This is not the 19th century in Honduras. This is Canada and we have a 21st century G-7 economy. When the leader of a G-7 country promises never to tax something, a lot of people around the world will believe him and make their investment decisions accordingly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622963">When the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> promised arbitrarily that he wanted to levy a 31.5% tax hike on the trust sectors that affected particularly seniors. It undoubtedly raised questions about Canada's image as a safe and secure place to invest. That is the crux of this. It is nice to be part of treaties, but if people break their word, if promises are broken, if the rules of the game are changed in midstream, then their credibility and integrity certainly come into question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622964">That is one example of where the government has dropped the ball involving foreign investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622965"> Let us not forget the finance minister's ever changing story on interest deductibility. We can talk about relevant issues to the security of foreign investment and the implications to that investment, the credibility of that. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="622966">Earlier when I asked a question and I wanted to put a couple of quotes on the table. I should take the opportunity to do this now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622967"> The question of interest deductibility is another flip-flop. It is to announce one thing, disrupt the marketplace and then all of a sudden change the story. It is a moving target. It is not will I tax it, will I allow the deductibility of interest on foreign investments or will I not. Now we are talking about double-dipping and double deductibility of interest in an offshore tax haven. We are talking about tower schemes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622968">There is more smoke and mirrors on the interest deductibility issue simply to confuse Canadians about the facts. The facts are the government, the finance minister particularly, did not do the homework. When we look at the reaction of the market and of the key leaders in the investment community, the retired senior partner of Ernst &amp; Young and immediate past president of the Canadian Tax Foundation, Mr. Allan Lanthier, said, “this is the single most misguided proposal I've seen out of Ottawa in 35”.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="622976">In his March 19 budget, the minister said that he was intending to end the deductibility of interest incurred on loans to invest overseas.

              <ParaText id="622980">There is something particularly interesting about how this issue has played out over the past six weeks. As legislators, we know that on every decision we can always find a number of interest groups or experts who are able to support a point of view or attack a point of view. In this case, however, everyone in the country, every serious commentator on this issue, were unanimous in their condemnation of the measure. In fact, as I read in some of the quotes, they basically said that this was the single most misguided policy Ottawa had seen in 35 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622981">The chair of the task force, Jack Mintz, also backed away from the government on this one. As I indicated, the president of the Canadian Council, the chief executives and the chair of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce were quick to tell the government it made a mistake and to fix it before the damage is irreparable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622982">A minister stood alone defending the merits of the policy until last week when he said he would clarify his position. It turns out, according to the minister, that every CEO, every commentator and journalist in the country had simply misunderstood his intentions. It is hard to make that argument when the statement in the budget is as clear as clear can be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622983">I think it is pretty clear to all Canadians that the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> is in full retreat from his original plan, thanks largely to the efforts of the leader of the official opposition who saw this was a bad policy for Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622984">It is absolutely clear, once again, that the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> did not think things through before acting. He tried to change the very complicated area of tax policy with a very simplistic blanket solution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622985">This is key. There is a pattern of not thinking things through. There are consequences and they are not linear, they are multi-dimensional. When we get situations, for instance, on income trusts, where there is a gap between the tax paid by income trusts compared to dividend-paying corporations and we close that gap so there is some equity, we want to be sure that there are no other consequences. What were the consequences? It was to tax the income trusts and not only close that gap, but actually tax it so much that we had a $25 billion meltdown.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622986"> It even gets worse than that when we look a little further down the road. Ever since the Halloween massacre of income trusts, there have been 20 or more takeovers of income trusts by private equity, a couple Canadian, but mostly foreign. Why? Because the value of these income trusts were driven down enormously. Private equities can purchase these at fire sale prices. They can structure their affairs so they do not pay taxes to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622987"> Now it gets more complicated. In fact, those 20 income trust takeovers, because their structure permits them to no longer pay Canadian taxes, will pay in a foreign jurisdiction. What is the loss of tax revenue to the Canadian government, in fact, to the taxpayers of Canada? It is $6 billion per year of tax hemorrhaging, lost revenue to the Government of Canada. The problem the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> said he was trying to fix was that there might be about $5 billion of tax leakage over six years. This seems to indicate the minister did not think it through.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="622988"> That is the issue. We cannot take a nuclear bomb to every problem. Sometimes it takes a little thinking and a little consultation before these snap decisions are made, which have such devastating consequences not only to Canadians, but to Canada's credibility and integrity in terms of foreign investor relations.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623009"> If I may draw a little on the history of how we came to be the country that we are this year, I remember early on when we, the Liberal government, had inherited a $42 billion deficit and a skyrocketing national debt. We also had a tax system that was burdening the business community as well as individuals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623010"> We had to turn all that around. We were very fortunate that we were very disciplined. We gave a strong signal to the IMF and the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> that in fact we were going to roll up our sleeves and bring about the type of positive change that the Canadian economy required. This is the connection between foreign investment and giving our country a friendly image abroad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623011">The point I am raising is that on interest deductibility and income trusts, there is not the type of signal that we want to send to foreign investors. It is not the type of signal that people are going to applaud. That is my concern with the manner in which the government is acting.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="623023">Mr. Speaker, from the beginning the Bloc Québécois has supported Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document>. Passing this bill will enable Canada to ratify the convention on the settlement of investment disputes between states and nationals of other states, and to become a member of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, better known by its acronym, ICSID.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623024">Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document> integrates the requirements of the international convention in the laws of a country, in particular to ensure that arbitral awards are respected and to provide for the immunities required by the centre and its staff. As my colleague opposite said, ICSID was created by the World Bank by the Washington Treaty in 1965. There are currently 156 member countries. ICSID is responsible for settling disputes between a state and a foreign investor. There may be two types of conflicts. The first type are disputes over bilateral foreign investment protection treaties. The second are disputes over treaties between governments and foreign investors, for example the type that the Government of Quebec concludes regularly by eliciting foreign investments with the promise of providing electricity at an agreed price.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623025"> Canada’s membership will not have any impact on the provinces, except that they too may have recourse to the ICSID when they conclude agreements with investors. As for bilateral treaties binding the federal government to other countries, they already provide for recourse to ICSID arbitration, but not through the regular mechanism, since Canada has not ratified the convention. In fact the only thing that Canada’s membership in the centre will change is that Canada will be able to intervene in negotiations to amend the convention or the rules of the centre and it will enjoy the assurance of being able to join in the appointment of arbitration tribunals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623026"> Ultimately the ICSID is only a tribunal. I could have said so at the beginning, but I am saying it at the end. Where there are settlement difficulties, however, the problem is not usually the tribunal, but rather the poor investment protection treaties concluded by Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623027"> The Bloc Québécois, of course, supports the conclusion of investment protection agreements, as long as they are good agreements. It is completely natural for investors, before making an investment, to try and make sure they will not be divested of their property or that they will not become victims of discrimination. This is the sort of situation that foreign investment protection agreements are meant to cover. In fact this is not a new phenomenon. Agreements to protect investments have been signed by France and the United States since 1788. Today there are over 2,400 bilateral investment protection agreements around the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623028"> The Bloc is in favour of concluding such agreements and recognizes that they promote investment and growth. However—and it is important to say so—almost all these agreements rest on the same principles: respect for property rights regardless of the owner’s nationality; no nationalization without fair and prompt financial compensation; prohibition against treating property located on one’s territory differently depending on its owner’s origins; free movement of capital arising from the operation and the disposal of the investment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623029"> In all cases, if there is non-compliance, states can submit a dispute respecting compliance with the agreement to an international arbitration tribunal. In most cases, investors themselves can submit disputes to an international tribunal, but only once they have got the state’s consent, and this is something to be noted. In many cases, the international arbitration provided for under the agreement takes place before the ICSID. Belonging to it, as is provided for under Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document>, also means belonging to the international order in the area of investments. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="40">(1140)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="623030"> In the investment protection agreements they have signed, only two countries, Canada and the United States, systematically give investors the right to apply directly to the international tribunals, and we have repeatedly spoken out against this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623031"> This is a deviation from the norm. By allowing a company to operate outside government control, it is being given the status of a subject of international law, a status that ordinarily belongs only to governments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623032"> The agreements that Canada signs with other countries contain a number of similar deviations, giving multinational corporations rights that they should not have and limiting the power of states to legislate and take action for the common good. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623033"> We said no—and we still say no—to chapter 11 of NAFTA. That chapter of NAFTA, the trade agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico, deals with investments and provides that a dispute can be taken to ICSID. That chapter is a bad agreement in three respects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623034"> The definition of expropriation is so vague that the slightest government action—other than a general tax provision—can be challenged by a foreign investor if it reduces the profits from its investment. For instance, a plan to implement the Kyoto accord that forced the oil companies, the big polluters, to pay large sums could be challenged under chapter 11 and result in the government paying them compensation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623035"> Let us remember that the Alberta oil companies are mainly owned by American interests. Chapter 11 could open the door wide to the most abusive proceedings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623036"> Second, the definition of investor is so broad that it includes any shareholder. This means that virtually anyone can bring proceedings against the state and seek compensation in relation to a government action that allegedly reduced a company’s profits. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623037"> Third, the definition of investment is so broad that it even includes the profits an investor hopes to earn from its property in future. In expropriation cases, not only is the state then forced to pay the fair market value, but it must add the amount of the income that the investor anticipated earning in future. In that case, it would no longer be possible to nationalize electricity as was done in Quebec in the 1960s. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623038"> The dispute resolution mechanism allows corporations to apply directly to the international tribunals to seek compensation, without even getting the consent of the state—if they do, without going through the dispute resolution mechanism under the agreements signed in NAFTA. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623039"> How is it conceivable that a multinational corporation could, on its own authority, create a trade dispute between two countries? And yet this is the absurd situation that the investment chapter of NAFTA, chapter 11, permits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623040">Because of these flaws, chapter 11 of NAFTA reduces the state’s capacity to take action for the common good, to legislate about the environment, and is a sword of Damocles that could come fall at any moment on any legislative or regulatory measure that might reduce corporate profits. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623041"> In 2005, the United States changed some of the provisions in their model investment protection agreement. In 2006, Canada followed suit, thus agreeing that they were extreme. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623042"> Since both countries have now acknowledged the harmful nature of chapter 11 of NAFTA, the time is ripe for the government to move quickly to initiate discussions with its American and Mexican partners to amend chapter 11 of NAFTA. It is important to bring this up now. Obviously, therefore, we are saying no to bad investment protection agreements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623043"> In addition to chapter 11 of NAFTA, and although its extreme nature has been widely decried, the government has entered into 16 other bilateral foreign investment protection agreements, and all are identical. All those foreign investment protection agreements—sometimes called FIPAs—are bad and should be renegotiated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623044"> In 2006, the government more or less acknowledged that these agreements were bad. It copied the changes made by the Bush administration the previous year.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="45">(1145)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="623045"> Indeed, the Conservative government made some amendments to its FIPA program to correct the most glaring weaknesses. For example, they clarified the concept of expropriation by specifying that a non-discriminatory government measure that seeks to protect health and the environment or promote a legitimate government objective should not be considered as expropriation and should not automatically generate compensation. It is too early to evaluate the final effect of that clarification, but at first glance, it seems to be an improvement and we salute that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623046"> It also restricted the concept of investment by specifying that the value of a good is equal to its fair market value. That put an end to the folly that added together all the potential profits that an investor hoped to earn from an investment. As for the rest, the model investment protection agreement continues to be based on Chapter 11 of NAFTA. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623047"> In our opinion, the government must continue to improve this model agreement, especially in terms of dispute settlement mechanisms. Multinational corporations must be brought under the authority of the state, like any other citizen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623048"> Before ending my remarks, I want to emphasize that the government must submit treaties and international agreements to the House of Commons before ratifying them. At the beginning of the year, the government issued a news release to announce that it had just ratified a new foreign investment protection agreement with Peru. It was only by reading that news release that parliamentarians and the public became aware of this agreement. Parliament was never informed and never approved it. That is completely anti-democratic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623049"> During the last election, however, the Conservative election platform was clear: the Conservatives made a commitment to submit all treaties and international agreements for approval before ratifying them. Since the Conservatives came to power, Canada has ratified 24 international treaties. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623050"> Apart from the amendments to the NATO treaty, which were the subject of a brief, last-minute debate and vote, none of these international treaties were submitted to the House. Today, international agreements have an effect of our lives that is comparable to the impact that the law can have on the lives of the citizens of all the countries with which Canada has signed bilateral agreements. There is no way to justify these treaties being concluded unilaterally and stealthily by the government, going over the heads of the representatives of the people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623051">The Bloc Québécois has introduced bills in the past to restore democracy and ensure the respect of Quebec and provincial jurisdictions in the conclusion of international treaties. Since the government promised to do this, we did not bring the issue up again at the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623052">We are now seeing that the word of the Conservatives is not worth very much. The Bloc Québécois will raise this issue again and will bring forward proposals to restore democracy in the conclusion of international treaties. Such proposals will include requiring the government to present to the House all international treaties and agreements it has signed before ratifying them, requiring the government to publish all international agreements by which it is bound, requiring the vote and approval of the House following an analysis by a special committee tasked with examining international agreements and major treaties before the government may ratify them, and calling on the government to respect Quebec and provincial jurisdictions in the entire process of concluding treaties, that is, all stages of negotiation, signing and ratification.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623053">I repeat, the Bloc Québécois is in favour of Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document>, which will open the door to signatory countries and foreign investors with which agreements have been signed. However, ICSID is a tribunal that simply hands down decisions regarding agreements. I would like to emphasize that, based on the principles of Chapter 11 of NAFTA, the 16 bilateral agreements signed by Canada are all bad agreements and that, unfortunately, even direct access to the ICSID tribunal could not replace the agreements that would be good for the countries with which we are signing them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623054">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document>. As I understand it, the purpose of the bill is for Canada to implement the provisions of the international convention on the settlement of investment disputes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623055"> I was not able to be here when the secretary of state introduced the bill and she may have addressed one of my questions that I posed to one of the Liberal members speaking to the bill. However, I reiterate the question because it seems to me it is something on which it is important for us to have some understanding. It has to do with the fact this convention has been open for signature for literally 42 years, from March 18, 1965 to this day. The obvious question that arises is, why now? What is the reason that today the government is proposing that something that has been on the books internationally and available for Canada to sign on to for years is suddenly a matter of sufficient importance and urgency to bring it forward in this Parliament?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623056">In the absence of understanding that, I have proceeded to try to make sense out of the bill. I want to make it clear at the outset that the members of the New Democratic Party will not be voting to support Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document> at this time. We have a number of concerns. I will try in the time available to me to summarize those concerns in three categories, first, with respect to matters of transparency, second, the issue of accessibility and third, matters of accountability. We find that this proposed agreement fails to meet the minimal test that we think is appropriate for a sovereign state to be able to seek reassurances that simply are not there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623057">First, I will speak briefly about transparency. The international convention on the settlement of investment disputes, proposes a consent based process for settling disputes. It is a difficulty that it is specified that once the consent of a party is given, there is no provision for there to be any revocation regardless of how flawed the process may be or how many concerns may arise in terms of how the whole process is being conducted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623058">The dispute settlement mechanism proposed by Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document> will not just adjudicate individual contracts between foreign companies and sovereign states; it will in fact become the principal international process through which other investment agreements will be interpreted and applied with binding results. Article 48(5) of the convention clearly states:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623059">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The Centre shall not publish the award without the consent of the parties.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623060">This creates a real concern about the transparency of the process. It seems that if matters are of sufficient import to our government, or for that matter to the corporations that are a party to such processes, there needs to be the assurance of there being some transparency around what has actually transpired.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623061">The mechanism that is being proposed will exist under the aegis of the World Bank. That is an organization with which a great many NGOs have concerns. A great many countries, particularly the poorest of the poor countries in the world have major concerns with the World Bank. The New Democratic Party has raised concerns about it as well and in fact is pleased that the foreign affairs and international development committee currently is seized with some of those concerns and is looking at the issues of transparency, accountability and accessibility.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="623062">It seems to me at the very least that the government should not be jumping ahead without a more thorough examination of some of the concerns that have been brought to our attention through the experience of respected NGOs. One such NGO is the Halifax Initiative, an organization that was established after the G-8 was held in Halifax. It has nothing to do with me or my riding specifically. There was concern that there were no adequate responses to some of these serious issues. Another of the NGOs that presented on the matter before the committee was KAIROS, a highly respected multi-faith organization which is very involved in international development work around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623063">Concerns have not only arisen around the transparency and accountability of the World Bank operation which have massive implications for countries in the south but actually about the transparency of the Canadian government's decision-making as it relates to our participation in the World Bank.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623064">These are issues that need to be examined more carefully with more satisfactory responses before we plunge into what is proposed here in the way of signing on to a convention. If for 42 years it has not been of sufficient or adequate usage by a series of Conservative-Liberal governments and the problems of transparency still remain with respect to the World Bank, it seems to me that it would be better if we put our house in order before we proceed with this new agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623065">Let me move briefly to the issue of accessibility. The process that is set out in the ICSID, which is the international convention that we are dealing with here, does not allow for third party testimony whatsoever. No matter how adversely some communities or other citizens may be impacted by certain contentious agreements between two parties, there is no allowance for what is called in legal terms amicus curiae briefs and is very problematic except with the full consent of the two parties to the arbitration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623066">There are citizens, communities and probably in some cases regional interests that could be massively impacted by some of these disputed agreements. It is not acceptable to us that there is no provision for some third party testimony being brought before an arbitration hearing. Couple that with the fact that there is no requirement for the decisions and the awards to be published, it is just a further reason for not being able to support this proposed process in its current form. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623067">Most proceedings will probably be held in Washington. There is provision for a few designated centres elsewhere around the world, but they will take place in a small number of capital cities and will be entirely inaccessible in many instances to those third parties who may have a distinct and legitimate interest in the proceedings. Therefore, there are issues about accessibility. There is no question that countries in the southern hemisphere will most likely be impacted in adverse ways around such procedures and disputes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623068">Third, with respect to accountability, as I have already indicated, all decisions issued through the proposed dispute mechanism will be binding. The provisions for any appeals that could be launched to such binding decisions are very narrow and minimal. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="55">(1155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="623069">According to article 52 in Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document>, annulment of a decision could only be permitted under five conditions: first, that the tribunal was not properly constituted in the first place; second, that the tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers; third, that there was actually documented corruption in the tribunal itself; fourth, that there was a breach in the rules of procedure; and fifth, the award failed to state the reasons on which the decision was based.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623070">Those are really very narrow legalistic provisions that would permit for any kind of appeal process whatsoever. Given the severe impact, the magnitude of the implications of decisions that may be rendered by such a dispute resolution body, when we combine the lack of transparency, the lack of accessibility with the lack of accountability, one has to be very concerned about why we need sign on to provisions that are this lacking in terms of really being transparent and accountable for its decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623071">Citizens cannot know which decisions are taken or how much their government is expected to pay in some cases where decisions are made that the government is a party to these decisions. We are talking largely about huge corporations, and in the instance of the government losing the decision, there is not even any kind of mandatory disclosure. In fact, the opposite is true. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623072">It is not permissible for there to be disclosure of how much a government may actually be forced to pay in the event of such a decision being made that has the government, representing the people of one's country, on the losing side.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623073"> In that event, how is it possible for citizens to hold their government accountable, or foreign corporate entities for that matter? How is it possible to judge the legitimacy of ICSID decisions that are reached? I think it fundamentally erodes the democratic accountability and the transparency that needs to be obtained. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623074">In conclusion, a great many Canadians remember, and certainly New Democrat members of Parliament remember all too well, the attempt of the previous government to plough ahead with the introduction of the multilateral agreement on investment. It was truly astounding when this came to light, it was actually a process that was so kind of clandestine and so below the radar that I remember asking questions on the campaign trail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623075"> I hope my memory serves me correctly. It was either in 1997 during the federal election campaign or 2000, and my colleagues confirm that my first instinct was right. My memory is never perfect, I have to confess to that, but in 1997 the multilateral agreement on investments had just barely risen to public awareness and it was impossible to get any information about what this agreement was really all about. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623076">Overwhelmingly, what we were hearing from people, the more we were able to delve into it, was that they were very concerned about the extent to which this multilateral agreement on investment would have severally curtailed the sovereign rights of states and citizens to the benefit, overwhelmingly, of large, transboundary, multinational corporations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623077">Had the ICSID process, the dispute mechanism that is here proposed in Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document>, existed at the time and had the multilateral agreement on investment gone ahead, cases of arbitration under the multilateral agreement on investment would actually have been channelled through the ICSID. As I mentioned at the outset when I raised questions about why now, why is this so-called new Conservative government now saying it has become very important for us to move ahead with this when it has been available for signature for 42 years, one really has to consider the adverse implications that would have accrued to Canada had we found ourselves in the situation of the MAI having gone ahead.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="00">(1200)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="623078"> Thank goodness Canadians were not prepared for that to happen, but had it gone ahead it would have become subject to this disputes mechanism body with all the additional concerns that I have already raised.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623079">With those reservations, the NDP has reached the conclusion that this is not a piece of legislation that we can support. We would have no recourse for arbitration decisions that would seriously erode the sovereign authority of the Canadian state had MAI gone into existence. We would have had no say whatsoever in the course of proceedings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623080">These are not light matters. These are not casual concerns. The ICSID process, while not substantive in itself, in our view has the very dark and worrisome potential to make bad financial investment agreements even worse. As I indicated at the outset, the New Democratic Party members of Parliament will not be voting for Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document>.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623086">Mr. Speaker, I do not know whether it will surprise the secretary of state to hear this. I am sure many others will not be surprised to know that the Chamber of Commerce has not approached me, and I am not insulted by that. It is not surprising it has not done so. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623087">There are various arguments in favour of signing on at this time. It is perhaps regrettable because if it had, it would have addressed some of the questions I raised, which I hope the secretary of state will choose to address in her wrap-up on the debate of Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document> at second reading.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623088">I have a great many corporations in my community, for which I have a good deal of regard and respect in terms of how they conduct themselves in a socially responsible way. In fact, it was thrilling for me that the Chamber of Commerce and the Greater Halifax Partnership jointly sponsored a major event on corporate social responsibility. One of the outstanding commentators on this topic came to address the subject, Stephen Lewis. There was a huge turn-out from the corporate community to address the questions of corporate social responsibility, and it made me feel very good about my community. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623089">I do not want to misrepresent that speech and I would not even try to begin to articulate the thrust of the case for corporate social responsibility having been put to the business community in Halifax by Stephen Lewis, but it was well received.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623090">Issues of transparency, accessibility and accountability in such disputed matters would rank very high with responsible corporations that take seriously the need to take responsibility for their actions and to ensure that people understand what kinds of disputes have occurred and then what kinds of decisions have come out of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623091">With those comments, I look forward to the secretary of state addressing the question of why now. Other that having cited the Chamber of Commerce. I did not hear her speak about what other kinds of representations from other citizens or corporations were made to the government that brought it to the decision to bring this forward as legislation at this time.

              <ParaText id="623092">Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78459" Type="2">Lévis—Bellechasse</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623093">I am pleased to have the opportunity to further explain Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document>, which implements Canada's obligation under the Implementation of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623094">Canada signed the ICSID convention on December 15, 2006. That signature was a public undertaking that Canada intended to pass legislation so we could ratify the convention. This bill is the fulfillment of that undertaking. I will say more later in my speech about the ratification of the convention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623095">The ICSID is an important convention for protecting investment around the world. ICSID awards can already be enforced in 143 countries. It is time to provide the benefit of ICSID to Canadian investors. However, to gain that protection for Canadian investors, Canada needs legislation to ensure that ICSID awards, wherever they are made, can be enforced in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623096">Canada also needs to provide the privileges and immunities needed for ICSID to function in Canada. We need to ensure that persons using conciliation under the convention cannot abuse that process. Canada needs to ensure that it can appoint qualified persons to ICSID panels.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623097">Previous speeches have provided an overview of the bill and its provisions dealing with enforcement. I will focus in this speech on privileges and immunities, conciliation and appointments to the panel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623098">Let me begin with privileges and immunities. The privileges and immunities provided for in this bill do not deal with the privileges and immunities of the foreign governments against which an award is made. Those privileges and immunities will continue to be governed by the Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623099">Instead, clause 5 of the bill deals with the privileges and immunities of the ICSID and of individuals working for the centre or engaged in ICSID arbitration. Generally, clause 5 simply faithfully incorporates into Canadian law the privileges and immunities which the convention requires.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623100">ICSID is provided with the legal capacity of a private person. This means it will be able contract, acquire property and institute legal proceedings. ICSID will be immune from legal process except when it waives this immunity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623101">Officers and employees of ICSID and people acting as conciliators or arbitrators will also be immune from legal process, but their immunity is limited. They will have immunity only for acts they have done in the exercise of their functions and only if the ICSID does not waive this immunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623102"> If they are not Canadians, these people are entitled to the same immunities and immigration restrictions, registration requirements and national service obligations as Canada extends to representatives, officials and employees of comparable rank of other states. The same rules apply to foreign exchange and travel restrictions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623103"> These rules would also apply to people appearing in ICSID proceedings as parties, agents, counsel, advocates, witnesses or experts. However, this immunity is generally limited to the period when they are travelling to and from the place where the proceedings are held and for the period of their stay there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623104">There is nothing new or unusual in the privileges and immunities which the convention and the bill provide to individuals. Immunity from legal process is limited to functional immunity. As to other privileges and immunities, Canada only needs to provide them on the same basis as it provides to officials of other states.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623105">All Canada's policies that apply to the extension of such privileges and immunities to officials of foreign states will also apply to the privileges and immunities provided to people under this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623106">I should also note that ICSID does not have to pay taxes or customs duties. Canadian may also not levy taxes on the salary or benefits of ICSID staff members who are not Canadians. Similarly, Canada will not tax ICSID conciliators or arbitrators who do their work in Canada if the only basis for such tax is that the work was done in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623107"> These tax privileges, like other privileges and immunities, are exclusively related to ICSID and its activities. They do not limit Canada's ability to tax Canadians. Indeed, if ICSID arbitrations and conciliations are not conducted in Canada, these tax privileges have almost no revenue impact.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="15">(1215)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="623108">I turn next to clause 10, the portion of the bill that deals with conciliation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623109">In addition to arbitration, ICSID also provides a conciliation process for investor state disputes. Conciliation is a process in which the parties to the dispute use a third party to clarify issues and to try to bring about agreement between them on mutually accepted terms. If the disputing parties reach agreement, the third party prepares a report explaining the issues and the agreement reached by the parties. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623110">Conciliation can only work if both the investor and the state can speak honestly and openly to the conciliator, but conciliation can break down. For conciliation to work, the parties and the conciliator have to be able to say things that might be damaging admissions in any subsequent court action or arbitration. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623111">The convention deals with this problem by requiring parties to the convention to ensure that what is said or written in an ICSID conciliation process will not be used in any subsequent proceeding. Clause 10 implements this obligation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623112">I now turn to clause 11, which provides for the governor in council to designate persons to the ICSID panel of conciliators and the ICSID panel of arbitrators. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623113">Articles 12 to 16 of the convention set up two panels, one for conciliators, one for arbitrators. Each state party to ICSID may designate four persons to each panel and the ICSID secretary general may also appoint ten. Panel members serve for renewable terms of six years, but continue in office until their successors are designated. People designated to panels must have recognized competency in the fields of law, commerce, industry or finance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623114">Articles 31 and 40 of the convention provide that if the secretary general of ICSID is required to appoint the chairman of a conciliation commission or an arbitral tribunal, he must select the chairman from the relevant panel. However, the parties to the dispute are free to appoint conciliators or arbitrators from outside the panel and may well agree on a chairman.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623115">Being named to the panel provides no remuneration. Historically, the chances of a panellist actually being asked to arbitrate or conciliate a case are quite small. This is because there have only been 118 cases decided by the ICSID arbitral tribunals and 5 conciliation reports issued over the last 40 years. Therefore, only 118 arbitrators have been appointed to chair arbitral panels and only 5 conciliators have been selected to chair conciliation commissions. Remember as well that the parties can appoint a chairman from outside the panel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623116">Once this bill is declared in force in Canada, Canada will be in a position to ratify the ICSID convention. The convention also permits us to designate provinces and territories as entities that could use ICSID arbitration. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623117">Some provinces with an interest in the convention still have concerns about the implementation and operation of the convention. We are working with the provinces and territories to resolve such concerns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623118"> Canada can designate a province or a territory under the convention at the same time as the ratification or at any time later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623119">I urge the House to consider this bill on an expeditious basis. One hundred and forty-three countries are already party to the ICSID convention. Canadians with investments abroad are asking us to make the ICSID option available to them. It is time to act.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623128">His last comment about this convention having been on the books for 40 years raises a further question. If in fact very few disputes have come before that body, is it because there are considerable concerns about the possibility that decisions could be rendered that could impact negatively on citizens or particular communities as a result of the dispute mechanism decisions that have been rendered? Perhaps he could indicate what he thinks that may suggest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623129">Second, I raised some concerns earlier about transparency, accessibility and accountability. I think a lot of people feel strongly about there needing to be transparency and accountability when we enter into such agreements. I wonder whether he could address that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623130">Third, as far as I understand it, either no provinces or very few provinces have given any indication that they are prepared to support this process and yet that would be a further stage of ratification, I believe, that would be required.

              <ParaText id="623132">Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned, to date, 143 countries have signed this convention. Also, subsequent agreements that we have signed, the free trade agreement and NAFTA, provide for the ICSID arbitrators to resolve the investor state disputes both in Canada and in the country which the investor is a national party. That indicates the importance of this convention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623133">I cannot say why the provinces did not sign this but it is more important to know that we need to have a level playing field for our investors dealing with other countries as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623134">I do not know why she says that there is no accountability in this process. We are discussing this act here in Parliament and it very clearly states the process. The idea that just because few disputes came before it there must be something wrong with the convention, that is not the idea. I do not know where she gets the idea that there should be disputes all the time every time. Most of the time, there are laws and situations in countries and the investors follow the local laws and do not need to go to these arbitrations. However, these are measures that give confidence to businesses and to everybody else that should those things arise dispute mechanisms are everywhere, including the WTO and NAFTA. This is something that is required and is needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623135">As for the provinces, for whatever concerns they have, we will act together, but this law needs to be passed here in Parliament and we will actually be working with everybody to create that environment.

              <ParaText id="623139"> These disputes can arise in a variety of situations, for example, when the country where the foreign investor is located passes laws that discriminate against the investor or in case of nationalizations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623140"> International arbitration is a proven method for resolving disputes. It is a way of resolving them without resorting to the legal system. It has long been acknowledged that the parties to a dispute can resort to arbitration and the results of the arbitration process will be recognized by the courts. For example, commercial arbitration awards in Canada, that is to say between businesses, are recognized and enforced by the courts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623141"> It is up to the parties to decide whether they want to resort to arbitration or the legal system. The flexibility that this provides is often much appreciated. In the case of the convention implemented by Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document>, which we are debating today, one of the great advantages of relying on arbitration is that it denationalizes the process. I will explain what is meant by that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623142"> When a dispute arises between a foreign investor and the host country, the investor has the option of pursuing the matter before the courts of the host country. Usually—and this would be the case in Canada, in Quebec, or anywhere else in the country—the foreign investor would be entitled to a fair and equitable hearing. The host country’s courts would not be prejudiced against the foreign investor and would reach a decision under the law. Sometimes, though, this would not happen. The court might well lean in the direction of its own government at the expense of the foreign investor, which, in a case of interest to us, could well be a Canadian company doing business abroad. I should say as well that another advantage of the arbitration process is that the parties choose the arbiters. When the matters in dispute are highly specialized, for example petroleum development or marine issues, choosing arbiters who are experts in the field can make the process more effective and result in better decisions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623143"> The arbitration process in the ICSID Convention is therefore one of the processes that are most often used for settling disputes between investors and states. My colleagues pointed out that more than 150 countries have already signed on to this arbitration process. The Convention has been ratified and is one of the international instruments to which the largest number of states belong. What distinguishes the convention to be implemented here in Canada by this bill is the mechanism for enforcing arbitration awards. It is an effective mechanism and that will help to protect investors. This is a key advantage of the ICSID Convention. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623144">In the great majority of cases, the losing party in arbitration will pay the award of an arbitral tribunal without the need for the successful party to take any enforcement proceedings. The same is true for investor state arbitration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623145">In Canada, arbitral awards, including investor state arbitral awards, are currently enforced pursuant to the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. This New York convention permits a limited review of an arbitral award by domestic courts. It allows a court to refuse to enforce an award if to do so would be contrary to public policy. In addition, it permits a state to exclude certain subjects from the application of the convention and thus from enforcement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623146">ICSID provides a better enforcement mechanism. It does not permit a state to exclude from dispute settlement any matter which the state has consented to submit to arbitration. ICSID awards are enforceable as if they were final decisions of a local court. This simple, efficient mechanism guarantees better protection for Canadian investors abroad.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="623147"> We can also think of companies like Bombardier, the mining companies, the large consulting engineering firms and SNC Lavalin, whose head office is in Montreal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623148"> Here are a few of the elements or clauses that make this bill an advantageous one for our businesses in Quebec and Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623149"> For example clause 8 in the bill provides for the automatic recognition and enforcement of an award given by an ICSID tribunal. Such an award is recognized and deemed to be a final judgment by a superior court of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623150"> Under the same clause, any superior court of Canada may recognize and enforce awards coming under the law. The superior courts include the Federal Court. The Federal court will have the necessary jurisdiction to hear requests for recognition of awards involving the Government of Canada and awards involving foreign governments and their political subdivisions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623151"> This same convention provides explicitly that awards are binding on the parties and cannot be subject to any judicial appeal or remedy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623152"> Thus a foreign tribunal cannot hear a request to the effect that an ICSID arbitral tribunal has gone beyond its jurisdiction or was not properly constituted. These cases, when they are undertaken for awards other than those of the ICSID, delay resolution of the dispute and payment of damages. The convention does not allow such dilatory remedies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623153"> Clause 7 of the bill provides that an award under the convention is not subject to any remedy, such as appeal, review and annulment in a Canadian court of justice. From this we can infer the very final effect of awards given under the convention. The decision to seek arbitration is entirely voluntary, but once the parties have agreed to it they cannot seek remedy from any other body, such as a court of justice. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623154"> The only remedies allowed in erroneous decisions are those laid down in the convention. Requests for review, interpretation or annulment of an award are heard, should the case arise, by the Secretary-General of ICSID. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623155"> Thus questions of error concerning awards cannot be submitted to national tribunals, but there remains a guarantee that erroneous awards will be remedied. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623156"> The ICSID Convention provides a good mechanism for resolving disputes and enforcing awards efficiently. This is an international instrument promoting arbitration and fair solutions for international investment disputes. This is why our government is presenting for second reading Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document>, which implements the ICSID Convention here, in Canadian law. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623169">Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to speak in support of Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53, </Document> the settlement of international investment disputes act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623170">The International Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, the ICSID convention, is an international instrument sponsored by the World Bank to facilitate and increase the flow of cross-border investment. The convention establishes a mechanism to resolve investment disputes between foreign investors and the host state in which they have made their investment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623171">The convention entered into force on October 14, 1966. As of January 2007, as the previous speaker mentioned, 143 states had ratified the convention, making it one of the most ratified instruments in the world. The majority of Canada's trading partners are party to this convention. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623172">Once ratified, the convention will provide additional protection to Canadian investors abroad by allowing them to include in the contracts with foreign states the option of arbitration under the convention. In addition, Canadian investors doing business in a country with which Canada has a foreign investment promotion and protection agreement will have recourse to arbitration for violations of the agreement. Becoming a party to this convention will also make Canada a more attractive destination for international investors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623173">As a small businessman and entrepreneur myself, I recognize that these sorts of multilateral agreements promote stability, the rule of law and confidence in the local economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623174">With hugely increased trade with emerging giants such as India, Brazil, China and other countries with governance structures different from our own, it is important that Canada be part of this international convention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623175">I have travelled extensively to China, India, eastern Europe and elsewhere in Europe. I can see that the developing countries still have a lot of work to do when it comes to honouring those agreements. That is where this is going to be of real importance and an essential tool for Canadians who want to invest in those countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623176">This is also true for Canadian investors abroad and for those international investors who choose to invest their money in Canada. I am glad that the government is moving forward with this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623177">However, the government is introducing a bill to promote cross-border investment, while at the same time it is demonstrating its complete lack of competence on this very issue. Let me summarize the government's failure to manage our economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623178">There is the betrayal on income trusts. Since April 18, 2007 there have been 16 income trust takeovers, many of which have been bought by large U.S. private equity firms. Private companies will ensure that not only are these businesses no longer paying Canadian taxes, but Canadian investors will no longer receive distributions on which they are taxed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623179">This is of particular shame in the energy trust sector. One of the most effective investment vehicles in this country was the income trust. Over the past 20 years Canadian energy trusts have been active in buying foreign interests and repatriating foreign capital to Canada. This trend has now been reversed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623180">Even worse is the impact it has had on ordinary working Canadians. When we talk about ordinary working Canadians we are talking about $35 billion lost, an average of $25,000 per Canadian. My heart goes out to those seniors who are past their prime earning years, and those working families who saw their investments reduced by a staggering 25% overnight. I think people will not make their decisions based on the Conservative leader's word ever again. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623181">The flip-flop on deductibility of interest incurred on loans used to invest overseas is another major example of how lost the Conservative Party is when it comes to managing the economy of our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623182">On April 16, 2007 our <Affiliation DbId="78331" Type="2"> Liberal Party leader</Affiliation> along with our finance critic, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78387" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation>, called on the Conservatives to reverse these disastrous policies before more Canadian companies and jobs were lost and long term damage was caused to Canada's competitiveness in the global marketplace. The Conservatives pretended that their interest deductibility proposal was about eliminating tax havens but that is false. It was too late for the finance minister to realize it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623191"> When it comes to agreements like this, I note that the Chamber of Commerce from my riding recently travelled to China. It is planning a trip to India.

              <ParaText id="623192"> The Pacific gateway project is another example. On one side of it, we are trying to put these documents in place to encourage investors to invest overseas and the overseas investors to invest here, and we have to provide an infrastructure for these kinds of agreements. I can look at the Pacific gateway project in my own riding. The government has to listen to ordinary Canadians, including one of is own members, and I am happy to have him as my constituent. He is also opposed to the way the government is throwing projects like the Pacific gateway through my riding, which is sacrificing the quality of life and the environmental protection of my own constituency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623193">Coming back to this issue, I personally believe that we should have these agreements in place, because it will be very easy for the investors going out there, not only for today but for many years to come. The Liberal government worked very hard in the last 13 years to restore the trust of Canadians in the economy, both here and overseas. I would say that the Conservatives should not play politics with the prosperity of Canadians when it comes to decision making.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623195">I think the hon. member and most members in the House recognize that foreign investment 40 years ago was not what it is today. It has increased substantially. I would also like to point out that in regard to the 143 countries that have signed on to ICSID, there have been 100 disputes, and the majority of those disputes have been just in the last five years.

              <ParaText id="623198">Mr. Speaker, I am in support of the bill because this is the type of decision we have to make. The secretary of state asks why now, after over 40 years. The ICSID convention was negotiated in the 1960s prior to the general inclusion of federal state clauses, provisions commonly found in international treaties that allow a state a position of ratifying a given convention in respect of some of its sub-entities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623199">Globalization is a reality as well. We are going through globalization today. Demographics play a key role. Canada being the most diverse country in terms of demographics, we have opportunities to invest overseas. I am very pleased to see that five of the provinces and territories have already ratified this and that the others remaining want to come to the table to make it easier for Canadians to compete in the global market today. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623209">Mr. Speaker, let us look at the example. It is clear that when we took over in 1993 Canada was an international credit risk. The country was almost broke. We were paying $40 billion in debt payments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623210">What we did as the Liberal government was that budget after budget there was a surplus or a balanced budget.

The flip-flopping of the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> is not putting investors' confidence in our economy in stable terms. We have to make long term decisions that promote goodwill among investors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623212">I am not the only one saying this. We can see it in investors' magazines, which tell us that Canada is the second best country next to Denmark to invest in. We are the best country to live in, in the part of the country that I come from, which is the lower mainland in the Vancouver area. In fact, then, we have to provide the infrastructure, as I said earlier. That infrastructure has to be done in such a way that there is no controversy.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="623216">Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise in this House to express the Bloc Québécois' support for Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623217">This bill will enable Canada to ratify the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States and to become a member of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623218">Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document> integrates the requirements of the international convention in the laws of a country, in particular to ensure that arbitral awards are respected and to provide for the immunities required by the centre and its staff. ICSID was created by the World Bank by the Washington Treaty in 1965. There are currently 156 member countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623219"> ICSID is responsible for arbitrating disputes between States and foreign investors. There may be two types of disputes: disputes related to compliance with bilateral foreign investment protection agreements and disputes related to agreements between governments and foreign investors. The Government of Quebec regularly signs the latter type of agreement when eliciting foreign investment with the promise, for example, of providing electricity at an agreed price.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623220"> Canada’s membership will not have any impact on the provinces, except that they too may have recourse to the ICSID when they conclude agreements with investors. As for bilateral treaties binding the federal government, they already provide for recourse to ICSID arbitration by the additional facility rules rather than the regular process, which is available only to countries that have ratified the convention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623221">In fact the only thing that Canada’s membership in the centre will change is that Canada will be able to intervene in negotiations to amend the convention or the rules of the centre and it will enjoy the assurance of being able to join in the appointment of arbitration tribunals. Ultimately, the ICSID is only a tribunal. The problem is not the tribunal, but rather the poor investment protection treaties concluded by Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623222">The Bloc Québécois supports the conclusion of investment protection agreements, as long as they are good agreements. It is completely natural for investors, before making an investment, to try and make sure they will not be divested of their property or that they will not become victims of discrimination. This is the sort of situation that foreign investment protection agreements are meant to cover. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623223">This is not a new phenomenon. The first known agreement that includes foreign investment protection provisions was reached between France and the United States in 1788, or over 200 years ago. There are now over 2,400 bilateral investment protection agreements around the world. If we include tax treaties, which have to do with the tax treatment of foreign investments and revenues, that would mean some 5,000 bilateral foreign investment treaties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623224">The Bloc is in favour of concluding such agreements and recognizes that they promote investment and growth. Almost all these agreements rest on the same principles: respect for property rights regardless of the owner’s nationality; no nationalization without fair and prompt financial compensation; prohibition against treating property located on one’s territory differently depending on its owner’s origins; free movement of capital arising from the operation and the disposal of the investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623225"> In all cases, if there is non-compliance, states can submit a dispute respecting compliance with the agreement to an international arbitration tribunal. In most cases, investors themselves can submit disputes to an international tribunal, but only once they have got the state’s consent. In many cases, the international arbitration provided for under the agreement takes place before the ICSID. Belonging to it, as is provided for under Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document>, also means belonging to the international order in the area of investments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623226">In the investment protection agreements they have signed, only two countries, Canada and the United States, systematically give investors the right to apply directly to the international tribunals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623227">This is a deviation from the norm. By allowing a company to operate outside government control, it is being given the status of a subject of international law, a status that ordinarily belongs only to governments.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="623228"> The agreements that Canada signs contain a number of similar deviations that give multinationals rights they should not have and that limit the power of the state to legislate and take action for the common good. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623229"> We say no to chapter 11 of NAFTA. The investments chapter of NAFTA, chapter 11, provides that a dispute can go to ICSID. That chapter is a bad agreement in three respects. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623230"> The definition of expropriation is so vague that the slightest government action—other than a general tax provision—can be challenged by a foreign investor if it reduces its profits from its investment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623231"> For instance, a plan to implement the Kyoto Accord that paid large amounts to the oil companies, big polluters that they are, could be challenged under chapter 11 and result in the government paying compensation. The Alberta oil companies are in fact mainly owned by American interests. Chapter 11 opens the door to the most abusive proceedings. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623232"> The definition of investor is itself so broad that it includes any shareholder. This means that virtually anyone can bring proceedings against the state and seek compensation in relation to a government action that allegedly reduced a company’s profits. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623233"> The definition of investment is so broad that it even includes the profits an investor hopes to earn from its property in future. In expropriation cases, not only is the state then forced to pay the fair market value, but it must add the amount of the income that the investor anticipated earning in future. In that case, it would no longer be possible to nationalize electricity as was done in Quebec in the 1960s. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623234"> Take the example of SunBelt, a company composed of a Canadian shareholder and a Californian shareholder. The business closed down when the Government of British Columbia eliminated the right to export water in bulk that it had been given. The Canadian shareholder, relying on Canadian laws, received compensation equivalent to the value of its investment: $300,000. The American shareholder, relying on chapter 11 of NAFTA, included in its claim all of its potential future earnings: $100 million. The case was settled out of court for an amount that was not disclosed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623235"> Given the amounts of money in issue, chapter 11 is a deterrent to any government action, particularly in relation to the environment, whose effect would be to reduce the profits of a foreign-owned corporation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623236"> As well, the dispute resolution mechanism allows corporations to apply directly to the international tribunals to seek compensation, without even getting the consent of the state.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623237"> How is it conceivable that a multinational could, on its own authority, create a trade dispute between two countries? And yet this is the absurd situation that the investment chapter of NAFTA permits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623238"> Given these flaws, chapter 11 of NAFTA reduces the state’s capacity to take action for the common good, to legislate about the environment, and is a Damocles’ sword that could come crashing down at any moment on any legislative or regulatory measures whose effect was to reduce corporations’ profits. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623239"> In 2005, the United States changed some of the provisions in their standard form investment protection agreement. In 2006, Canada followed suit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623240"> Since both countries have now acknowledged the harmful and extreme nature of chapter 11 of NAFTA, the time is ripe for the government to move quickly to enter into discussions with its American and Mexican partners to amend chapter 11 of NAFTA. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623241"> We say no to bad investment protection agreements. In addition to chapter 11 of NAFTA, and although its extreme nature has been widely decried, the government has entered into 16 other bilateral foreign investment agreements, carbon copies of chapter 11. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="623242"> All of these foreign investment agreements are faulty and should be renegotiated. In 2006, the government recognized to some degree that these agreements were bad. Copying the amendments made by the Bush administration the previous year, the Conservative government made changes to its FIPA program to correct the most obvious shortcomings. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623243"> It clarified the concept of expropriation by specifying that a non-discriminatory government measure that is intended to protect health and the environment or to promote a legitimate government objective should not be considered as expropriation and should not automatically generate compensation. It is too soon to evaluate the real impact of that clarification, but at first glance, it looks like an improvement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623244"> Moreover, it restricted the concept of investment by specifying that the value of property is equal to its fair market value. That put an end to the folly of adding together all the potential profits that an investor might hope to earn from an investment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623245"> As for the rest, the standard investment protection agreement continues to be based on chapter 11 of NAFTA. The government must continue to improve this standard agreement, particularly in terms of dispute settlement mechanisms. Multinational corporations must be brought under the authority of the state, like any other citizen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623246"> It is important that the government submit international treaties and agreements to the House of Commons before ratifying them. At the start of the year, the government sent out a news release to announce that it had just ratified a new foreign investment protection agreement with Peru. It was only by reading that news release that parliamentarians and the public became aware of this agreement. Parliament was never informed and never approved it. That is completely anti-democratic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623247"> Yet, the Conservative platform in the last election was clear: the Conservatives made a commitment to submit all international treaties and agreements for approval before ratifying them. Since the Conservatives came to power, Canada has ratified 24 international treaties. Except for the amendments to the NATO treaty, which were the subject of a mini-debate and vote at the last minute, none of these international treaties was submitted to the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623248"> International agreements today have an impact on our lives that is comparable to the impact that legislation can have. Nothing can justify the government’s going over the heads of the representatives of the people and quietly and unilaterally entering into these agreements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623249"> In the past, the Bloc Québécois has introduced bills to restore democracy and ensure that the jurisdictions of Quebec and the provinces are respected in negotiating international treaties. Given that the government has committed to doing that, we have not taken that step this time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623250">We can see today that the Conservatives' commitments are not worth the paper they are written on. The Bloc Québécois will therefore start bringing forward again proposals to restore democracy in the making of international treaties, including the obligation on the government to submit to the House any international treaty or agreement it enters into, before it is ratified; the obligation on the government to publish every international agreement it is involved in; approval and vote in the House on any major treaty, following consideration by a special committee on international agreements, before the government can ratify it; respect for the jurisdictions of Quebec and the provinces at every stage of the treaty-making process: negotiations, signing, and ratification.</ParaText>

                <B>Mrs. Vivian Barbot:</B> With respect to Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document> more specifically, we can note the following. While it may appear complex because the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States is appended to it, also called the Washington treaty, Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document> is relatively simple. It is only a dozen clauses on three pages, integrating into domestic law the requirements under the provisions of the Washington treaty.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="623254">Regarding arbitration and conciliation proceedings commenced after its coming into force, the bill provides, in clause 4, that the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes and its personnel have the privileges and immunities, even fiscally, that it needs to operate in Canada. In clause 8, it provides for the legal recognition of arbitration awards rendered by the centre. Clause 7 prohibits, as required under the convention, proceedings before national tribunals on the substance of matters that have already been determined by the ICSID. Under clause 9, they are further prohibited from determining matters under arbitration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623255">These provisions may be startling in that they take away from national legislation. They are, however, pivotal to the functioning of international arbitration tribunals. Indeed, in many countries, the judicial system is not separate and independent from the political system. That is precisely why investment agreements call for neutral arbitrators. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623256">If national tribunals were allowed to reverse arbitration awards or to have parallel proceedings on matters already under arbitration, it would be pointless to have international arbitration tribunals, and the safeguards in investment protection agreements would hardly be worthwhile.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623257"> Under clause 6, the bill makes awards binding on the federal government. This means that Ottawa would be bound by an arbitral award that might require it, for example, to provide compensation to an injured investor. Only the federal government is bound by the bill, not the provinces. In fact, apart from chapter 11 of NAFTA, which is binding on the provinces because they joined NAFTA, no bilateral agreement to protect investments is binding on the provinces. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623258"> If, for example, a province passed a measure that injures a foreign investor who is covered by an agreement to protect investments and ICSID ordered that he should be compensated, Ottawa would be responsible for paying. It may seem absurd, but that is how it is under the Constitution. The provinces are fully sovereign in their areas of jurisdiction and Ottawa cannot unilaterally arrogate one of their powers or impose obligations on them by concluding an international treaty. Anything else would amount to depriving them of powers conferred on them by the Constitution, and the courts have refused to do that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623259"> That is why Quebec has always insisted on being closely associated with all stages of the entire process for concluding international treaties. That is the basis of the Gérin-Lajoie doctrine. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623260"> The federal government’s refusal to respect the logic of the division of powers and its wrongful arrogation of exclusive control over international relations not only hurts Quebec but is frankly dysfunctional. Once Canada ratifies this convention and joins ICSID, the provinces can do the same if they want. If they want, they can include clauses in the contracts they sign with investors providing for recourse to ICSID. Ottawa’s ratification does not impose any obligations whatsoever on Quebec or the provinces, although it does add further arrows to their quiver in their search for foreign investment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623261"> Finally, it was the Uniform Law Conference of Canada consisting of representatives from the justice departments of all the provinces, including Quebec, and from the federal government that recommended five years ago that the federal government should join ICSID, ratify the convention and implement it. That would be the effect of Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623262"> In clause 11, Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document> gives the government the power to designate conciliators and arbitrators in cases involving it that fall under ICSID. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623263"> There are generally three people on the arbitral tribunals. Each country that is party to a dispute appoints an arbitrator and these two arbitrators then agree on a third, who acts as the president. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623264"> It is in light of these considerations that the Bloc Québécois supports Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document>. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623267">Mr. Speaker, we want to make it clear that because of certain poorly worded bilateral agreements, we find ourselves having to deal with the possibility of certain companies dealing directly with foreign governments as though they were themselves a government. In reality, the problem does not lie with the convention proposed in Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document>, but with previous agreements. We are asking the government to review them because they contain real problems and may lead to abuses. Companies have powers that far exceed those of the government if they can act as though they were a government when dealing with foreign governments. In our opinion, this is not right.</ParaText>

That brings me to a question about accountability. One of the things that concerns me is the transparency and accountability of the ICSID.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623269"> I wonder if the member could comment on the issue of accountability, the fact that all decisions issued through the ICSID arbitration are binding and that there is minimal appeal process clearly taking authority away from the member state and provinces and putting it in the hands of the World Bank. I would be very interested in the member's response.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623270">Mr. Speaker, obviously that is one of the problems with all these agreements that seem to have governments taking a back seat. For this reason, we are saying once again that we should review these bilateral agreements from the perspective of the country's laws. As we stated, in the document, the various organizations or commercial entities should receive the same treatment as individuals of a given country since the law applies equally to everyone. That is why this government must revise the agreements as quickly as possible to ensure that they are equitable and also to address the matter of responsibility. We must know which courts have jurisdiction and for what purposes and we must ensure that there is coherence in the treatment of the various entities concerned, in order to prevent preferential treatment.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623274"> Obviously, the question of democracy arises in this context. We have observed this in all sorts of areas. This government is accustomed to making decisions that concern everyone when the House is not sitting. This is all the more serious when international agreements are entered into on behalf of the citizens we represent. It is a denial of democracy when the government assumes this right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623275"> As parliamentarians, our duty to protest is intact and we ask that the government be accountable. Nonetheless, once the government enters into a treaty, the treaty becomes applicable and people feel they have been had. Worse still, they are not even in the picture since decisions are often made when everyone is away and people are not even informed of the decisions made on their behalf.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623276"> You will understand in this context that going to the polls leaves us with a bit of a bitter taste. The government goes back to the people to ask for a new mandate, which ultimately enables it to turn around and do something else, yet it does not bother to consult the people's elected representatives. That is what I think about the question.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="623277">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank you for allowing me to speak today to Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53, An Act to implement the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (ICSID Convention)</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623278">To begin with, it is interesting that the Conservatives are introducing a bill to promote cross-border investment at a time when they are demonstrating their complete lack of competence on this very important subject matter. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623279">It was only yesterday, the<Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4"> finance minister</Affiliation> was forced by the Liberal opposition, may I add, to make a complete reversal on his ill-advised interest deductibility proposal in the budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623280"> Despite the government's mishandling of the Canadian economy at the domestic and international levels, it is important that Canada join the vast majority of countries in the world that have ratified ICSID. With increased trade with emerging giants such as China, India and other nations where the government structure is different from our own, it is critical that Canada be part of an international convention on the enforcement of investors' rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623281">Allow me to provide a bit of historical background on ICSID to clarify the importance of this convention. I am sure my colleagues in the past have talked about this during debate, but I think it is very important to highlight this description.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623282">The ICSID convention is an international instrument, sponsored by the World Bank, to facilitate and increase the flow of cross-border investment. The convention establishes a mechanism to resolve investment disputes between foreign investors and the host state in which they have made their investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623283">Countries agreeing to the hearings do so voluntarily on the part of each party. However, once they have agreed to a hearing, neither one can unilaterally withdraw from the process or refuse to pay damages awarded by the tribunal. Thus, no longer can we be in dispute and have one side just get up from the table and walk away. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623284">These hearings are unbiased and to ensure this, the arbitrator is selected by the contesting parties themselves. The ICSID then provides the hearings with a venue and the administrative support required to facilitate the specific meetings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623285">The ICSID convention entered into force on October 14, 1966. As of January 2007, 143 states had ratified the convention, making it one of the most ratified instruments in the world. The majority of Canada's trading partners are party to the convention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623286">Over the past decade, there has been an increasing number of bilateral trade and/or investment treaties. Since most parties involved in bilateral investment treaties refer present and future investment disputes to the ICSID, the case load of this particular process has substantially increased.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623287">As of June 30, 2005, ICSID had registered 184 cases; more than 30 of which were pending against Argentina. As many know, Argentina's economic crisis in the late 1990s and subsequent Argentinian government measures led several foreign investors to file a case against Argentina. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623288">Investment disputes brought under the convention are administered by the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes located in Washington, D.C.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623289">In the last few years, the activity at the centre has soared due to increased flows of cross-border investment and the number of investment treaties that refer to ICSID arbitration. While the centre has handled 110 arbitrations in total during the first four years of its existence, there are currently 105 proceedings under way. Since its inception, the centre has established itself as a reliable and effective organization for resolving investment disputes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623290">Once ratified, the convention would provide additional protections to Canadian investors abroad by allowing them to include in their contracts with foreign states the option of arbitration under the ICSID convention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623291">In addition, Canadian investors doing business in a country with which Canada has a foreign investment protection agreement will have recourse to ICSID arbitration for violations of the agreement. Becoming a party to the ICSID convention will also make Canada a more attractive destination for international investors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623292">The most significant advantage of the convention is the enforcement of the arbitral awards. Unlike awards issued by other arbitration institutions, domestic courts cannot refuse to enforce decisions issued under the ICSID convention. Rather, such awards are enforceable in any country that has ratified the convention as if they were the final judgments of the courts in that state.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="30">(1330)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="623293">Canada signed the ICSID Convention on December 15, 2006, becoming the 143rd country to do so. British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nunavut, Ontario and Saskatchewan have already adopted their own implementing legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623294">I mentioned that some provinces and territories have adopted their own implementing legislation because in order to ratify this bill all provinces and all territories must support the convention and take the necessary action to facilitate this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623295">It has become known that all provinces and territories have voiced their support with the principles and guidelines outlined in Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623296">What is truly the best part of this convention, though, is the fact that it is not open to interpretation. It is simple, straightforward legislation that not only our major trading partners, by and large, already agree upon, but it is the type of understanding and guidelines that many of our potential trading partners are looking for us to agree with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623297">By passing Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document>, Parliament sends a strong signal to other countries, as well as our own investors, that Canada is serious about honouring its commitment to international treaties and trades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623298">In my role as the critic for international trade in the opposition, I must emphasize how important the passing of this legislation is right now. Canada, as many people have read in the newspaper, is most likely being taken to arbitration by the United States over several complaints within the softwood lumber agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623299">Despite the strength of Canada's legal position, supported by numerous decisions of international trade law tribunals and domestic courts in both Canada and the United States, the Conservative government rushed negotiations with artificial timelines to maximize political value of the agreement for the Conservative Party of Canada and not the Canadian public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623300">The Conservatives' electoral agenda was put ahead of the interests of the industry that is a significant element of the Canadian economy in every region of this country. It is an industry that exports over $7 billion. It is an industry that represents thousands of jobs, approximately 300,000 jobs, that are directly impacted by this particular industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623301">In fact, there is a possibility that the U.S. may now use the dispute resolution mechanism to their advantage. It is possible that these consultations may not result in a satisfactory resolution. In this case, the U.S. can ask that the matter be referred to the London Court of International Arbitration. In addition, under the softwood lumber agreement, the U.S. has the immediate and unconditional right to terminate, whenever it wants, the softwood lumber agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623302">The government signed an agreement with the United States to bring an end to long-standing disputes regarding a very important and key subject matter in softwood lumber. When it did so, it agreed to throw out previous rulings from NAFTA and the WTO courts and tribunals. The current <Affiliation DbId="78741" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation> then said that this agreement would provide predictability and stability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623303">Who would have predicted that seven months into a seven year agreement we would be going to arbitration because the U.S. is knit-picking on issues like what constitutes a surge mechanism in B.C. and why Canada is not collecting more export charges than they should?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623304">This is the start of consultations and possibly arbitrations. Will the U.S. next have issues with stumpage fees in Alberta as it has indicated? Is that stability? I can almost predict the next seven years of stability based on the trend of the first seven months, and it is not looking good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623305">With any agreement there needs to be predictability and stability, and I agree with that. While it is regrettable, and it is too late to turn back the clock on the softwood lumber agreement, now is the time that we should move forward on protecting Canadian investors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623306">Because Canada is not an ICSID member, Canadian investors are unable to use ICSID arbitration rules in their disputes with other foreign states, including those where Canadian investors might lack confidence in the court system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623307">I would not be doing my job as a critic if I did not point out that the government, in implementing this convention, would go a long way to instilling a bit of confidence in its investors. They have certainly been knocked around in the past several months by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623308">As I mentioned earlier, the government had to reverse its decision to eliminate the interest deductibility policy, which, by the way, was the worst policy to come out of Ottawa in over 35 years. It has been widely condemned across the business community by economists. The implications of doing this would have been disastrous to investors if the minister had not reversed the policy. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="623309">As bad as that was, we should not forget how much the income trust reversal hurt Canadian investors, particularly seniors. The decision to tax income trusts wiped out more than $25 billion in savings overnight and reversed a key Conservative campaign promise, a promise they had in their platform. Canadians invested their money based on this promise and their trust cost them tens of thousands of dollars on an individual basis of their hard-earned savings. Not only did the income trust reversal impact Canadian investors but it also affected our international competitiveness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623310">All that aside, Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document> is an effective tool to help protect Canadian investors and should help to mitigate the damage done by recent government flip-flops.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623311">As we know, the government has been slow on signing free trade agreements. According to the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, China will not sign a free trade agreement or do business with a country that is not a member of ICSID. India has also ratified the convention and has entered into investment dispute settlements under the ICSID Convention with 11 countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623312">As I am sure many are aware, China and India are not only the two largest countries in the world in terms of population, but they are also the fastest growing economies. As these two economies continue to grow and their labour forces become more and more skilled, greater investment will flow into these economies. China is emerging as a world player in terms of manufacturing, while India is gaining notice for its knowledge based services. As their economies become more sophisticated, they in turn will increase investment outside their borders, including investment in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623313">Over the past 11 years, China has been the largest recipient of foreign direct investment among developing countries. Cumulative investment in China has reached almost $750 billion over the past 11 years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623314">Since 1991, India has embarked on a wide-ranging economic reform program that has seen increased developments in terms of trade, investment and monetary and exchange rate policies. One of the highlights of India's economic reform is its trade policy. India has systematically reduced its customs tariffs from 150% in 1991-92 to 25% in 2003-04.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623315">Both China and India have become very forward-looking in their approaches to foreign investments. By ratifying the ICSID Convention within their respective countries, they have taken a proactive approach to protecting their investors internally and abroad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623316">I urge the House to pass this bill so that as a country we can move forward with signing investment treaties and trade deals that will make Canada and Canadians more prosperous and so Canadians can enjoy a high quality of life for generations to come. I think this is a very important initiative and it is well overdue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623317">I have expressed my concerns with the government with respect to its legacy and the first 13 months of broken promises, of hurting and damaging our competitiveness and of impairing our ability to be productive. This is one small step toward that direction and I hope the government proceeds with this in a timely fashion.</ParaText>

It is really rooted in the fact that the Conservatives make policy decisions based on political expediency. They develop poor public policy around the fact that they can get around the Canadian public by developing gimmicks, but it has caught up to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623333">The softwood lumber agreement, as he indicated, was a completely flawed deal that really damaged Canada's credibility in our trade relationship with the United States.

              <ParaText id="623335">Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the member a question in regard to the procedure for the constitution of ICSID in terms of what it means for the ability of investors to be free of the courts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623336">Essentially it says that Canadian investors in foreign countries often fear that foreign courts will be biased in favour of their state and their country's laws and the convention that is being contemplated here shelters foreign investors from the courts of the country in which the investment is made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623337">Why is this bad? If we look at some of the reality, we have foreign investors who have not always been stellar corporate citizens. I am thinking about Union Carbide in Bhopal and the travesty committed against that community. None of those victims had recourse in terms of the behaviour of the corporation. Coca-Cola right now is taking a huge amount of water in India and polluting local water systems, much to the disadvantage of local people. We saw Talisman in Nigeria behaving in such a way that local people reacted against that company, which ended in the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa; and other multinationals, water providers who tried in Bolivia to privatize the water resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623338">My concern is that these companies can hide behind this convention. What on earth happens to the locals, the nationals, who may need and deserve recourse in their courts?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623339">Mr. Speaker, again, I appreciate the concerns raised by the hon. member. One needs to recognize, as I have said before, the premise of how this all operates. Canada is trading nation. We must acknowledge that. With the population of 32 million, the only way we can sustain our quality of life is to ensure we have proper trade and investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623340">The member raises the notion of how we approach this. The best way for Canada to succeed at the global level is, as an example, the WTO Doha round of discussions. That is by far the best means for us to secure the best deal for Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623341">Canada should not avoid ratifying this treaty. One hundred and forty-three countries have already signed on, Canada being 143 to do so. It is a way for us to have credibility on the international level to ensure we instill confidence in investors. The system in the process has been adopted by many countries, which is a very transparent and straightforward process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623342">I have indicated in my remarks that both parties select arbitrators. This process has been implemented on many occasions very successfully, with both parties agreeing to the parameters. The way it is set up benefits not only them, but helps further promote investment between the countries as well. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623344">Mr. Speaker, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78477" Type="2">Mississauga South</Affiliation> raises a very important issue. Today our country generates a surplus, which is respected by the international community for sound fiscal management. However, if we were to look back to 1993, our country had lost the confidence of the world and was beginning to lose the confidence of the Canadian public. Our deficit was around $42 billion to $43 billion. The debt was growing out of control. Our financial market was weakening. Our dollar was weak. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623345">Those problems really hurt investors. Now there is sound fiscal management because of the Liberal Party and the hard work by Canadians, which turned that around.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623346">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in this debate on Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623347"> Although the bill is extremely technical, it does not change much for Canada. However, it still offers an opportunity to ask ourselves about the nature of the investment agreements that have been signed by the Canadian government, and more specifically the bilateral agreements, and about the content of the North American Free Trade Agreement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623348"> The problem lies not so much in Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document> as in the agreements that we are signing, that are arbitrated under that convention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623349"> I would note that if this bill is enacted, it will make it possible for Canada to ratify the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, and will also make it possible for Canada to become a member of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623350"> As we can see, this means incorporating the requirements of the ICSID Convention into domestic law, to ensure that arbitral awards can be enforced and to provide the necessary immunities for the centre and its personnel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623351"> The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes was created, we should remember, by the World Bank, under a treaty referred to as the Washington Convention of 1965. As of today, 156 countries have ratified the convention and are members of ICSID. The purpose of the convention and the centre is to arbitrate disputes between a state and a foreign investor.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623352"> There are two possible kinds of disputes between a state and a foreign investor. There are disputes relating to compliance with bilateral foreign investment protection agreements. For example, and I believe this was mentioned earlier, we recently signed an agreement with Peru. However, hardly anyone in the government alerted us to the signing of a new bilateral investment agreement. That agreement was very quietly signed between Canada and Peru. If it results in challenges, they can be arbitrated under this convention, and by this centre. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623353"> There is a second possible type of dispute. Disputes arise regarding agreements signed by governments with foreign investors. The government of Quebec regularly signs these kinds of agreement to generate foreign investment, for example by promising to supply electricity at an agreed price.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623354">One can think of a number of major projects carried out on the North Shore. Discussions were held and commitments were made concerning electricity rates for the aluminum sector in exchange for commitments from the companies with respect to economic benefits from second and third processing, or future investments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623355">As I said, Canada's membership will not have any impact on the provinces. Only the federal level will be affected, although the provinces also will have the possibility of including in agreements they might enter into with investors provisions providing for the use of the centre and the convention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623356">Quebec has negotiated in the past, and could do so again in the future, agreements with foreign companies involved in the exploitation or processing of natural resources for competitive electricity rates under certain conditions. In such cases, it will be necessary to ensure that the endeavours of the Government of Quebec, whose good faith I never doubt, meet all the criteria in the agreement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623357">I have mentioned the bilateral treaty between the federal government and Peru. This treaty already provides for the use of arbitration or the ICSID process. Canada not being a member of the ICSID, it does not have access to the regular process because it has not ratified the convention. Additional facility arbitration rules apply under such circumstances. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623358">As we can see, nothing much will change, except that we will be able to use the regular process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623359">In fact, Canada's adherence to the centre and the convention will enable it to take part in negotiations to amend the convention or the centre's rules, and ensure its ability to participate in appointments to arbitration tribunals.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="623360">I believe that this is important, because we know that this centre and this sort of convention will be increasingly important not only to the economic future, but to the overall future of trading nations such as Canada and Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623361">In the final analysis, the centre is just a tribunal, and in that respect, we do not have a problem with Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document>. What we have a problem with is not the tribunal, but the poor treaties Canada has signed to protect investments. In our view, it is only natural that there should be investment protection agreements, provided that those agreements protect certain rights, especially the sovereign rights of the states involved, whether the agreements are between states or between states and companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623362">It is only natural for investors to try and make sure that they will not be divested of their property and that they will not become victims of discrimination. This is the sort of situation that foreign investment protection agreements are meant to cover. They are not a new phenomenon, but have been around for more than two centuries now. In 1788, France and the United States signed an agreement to protect foreign investments. Today, there are 2,400 bilateral investment protection agreements in the world. If we add tax treaties covering the tax treatment of foreign investments and foreign source income, there are roughly 5,000 bilateral treaties relating to foreign investments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623363">I spoke yesterday about Bill <Document DbId="2515623" Type="3">C-33</Document> on foreign trusts, and I will come back to that.</ParaText>

Although I had absolutely no indication that anything was wrong with me, it was at this screening that I was diagnosed with malignant melanoma. This is one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer, but it was caught early at the screening right here, and today I am healthy and cancer free.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623398">This year's clinic is today. I urge all MPs to go to the clinic this afternoon in Room 200 West Block from 5 p.m. until 7 p.m, even if they have no signs of problems.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623417">Canadians appreciate what our government has been getting done for families and persons with disabilities. We understand the important contribution families make to Canada. That is why we are investing more to support families' choice in child care than any federal government in our history, three times more than the Liberals did, but there is more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623418">Our government is helping families enjoy the benefits of a better, safer and stronger Canada. Budget 2007 introduced a new registered disability savings plan, a working families tax plan that includes the new child tax credit, a more attractive RESP for students, and initiatives for seniors. This is on top of previously announced initiatives such as the universal child care benefit and the children's fitness tax credit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623419">While today is a special day to pay tribute to families, Canadians now have a government that acknowledges the importance of all families every day.

              <ParaText id="623651">In his submission, the parliamentary secretary explained that Bill <Document DbId="2159677" Type="4">C-280</Document> proposed to change the manner in which provisions of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act would come into effect. That act was amended in 2001 by Bill <Document DbId="10095" Type="3">C-11</Document>, which contained a clause, clause 275, providing that:</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623653">This sort of clause is frequently found in bills and is commonly known as the “coming into force clause”.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="623654">Some provisions of Bill <Document DbId="2172053" Type="3">C-11</Document> have yet to be proclaimed by the governor in council. Bill <Document DbId="2159677" Type="4">C-280</Document> proposes to have three such provisions, namely sections 110, 111 and 171 of the act, brought into effect immediately upon royal assent of Bill C-280, and not by way of proclamation to be determined by the governor in council.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="623655">The parliamentary secretary noted that the substantive effect of implementing sections 110, 111 and 171 of the act would be to establish the refugee appeal division at the Immigration and Refugee Board and that this would entail significant new expenditures of an administrative nature. He then went on to explain that through its coming into force clause, Bill C-11 gave the governor in council the power to determine at what time the division would be created and the associated expenditures would be incurred.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623656">The parliamentary secretary contends that by changing the coming into force of these sections of the act, the terms and conditions of the royal recommendation accompanying Bill C-11 are being altered. He read from citation 596 of Beauchesne's sixth edition, which explains that the royal recommendation not only fixes the amount of an expenditure but also the way that it would be incurred.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623657">He went on to cite two precedents from 1985 and 1986 to support his arguments that Bill <Document DbId="2159677" Type="4">C-280</Document> should therefore be accompanied by a new royal recommendation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623658">The Chair has examined the two precedents cited by the parliamentary secretary in support of his basic argument that an alteration in the coming-into-force provisions of a bill infringes on the financial initiative of the Crown.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="623659">The first precedent, in 1985, concerns a report stage motion to Bill C-23, an act to amend the Small Business Loans Act. The bill sought, among other things, to restrict to 90% the amount of loss sustained by the minister for loans made to small business enterprises after March 31, 1985. The report stage motion sought to maintain the existing law and make the minister liable for the full amount of the loss. On March 26, 1985, Mr. Speaker Bosley ruled the amendment inadmissible because it relaxed a condition of the royal recommendation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623660">The second precedent, in 1986, concerns an amendment put forward during consideration in committee of the whole of Bill C-11, an act to amend the Income Tax Act. The bill sought to allow the prepayment of a child tax credit in the following taxation year. The amendment would have permitted the prepayment during the greater part of the current taxation year. In ruling the amendment inadmissible on October 17, 1986, the chairman of the committee of the whole simply explained that the proposed amendment infringed on the royal recommendation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623661">While these precedents may be useful in understanding how programs may be limited or extended in their application, they do not assist us in better understanding the issue at hand.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="623662">The fundamental issue in the present case is whether the coming-into-force provision of an act which was originally accompanied by a royal recommendation can be altered without a new royal recommendation.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="623663">After considerable reflection on the matter, the Chair would present the situation as follows.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623664"> In 2001 Bill C-11 sought an authorization from Parliament to establish the refugee appeal division. As I see it, the action of setting up the statutory framework for the new division required that a royal recommendation accompany Bill C-11 because a new and distinct authority for spending was being requested.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623665">As it happened, Bill C-11 also contained a coming into force provision which would allow the governor in council to decide when the refugee appeal division would be formally established. In the view of the Chair, it is very important to remember that even after the governor in council proclaims the establishment of the division, Parliament would still have to approve spending plans for its operations through the estimates and the subsequent appropriation act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623666">In this light, therefore, it appears to the Chair that the chief financial components which require a royal recommendation are: first, authorization for setting up the statutory framework for the refugee appeal division, duly provided by Bill C-11 with its original royal recommendation; and the operational funding to be sought in a future appropriation act where financial authority can be duly provided in the usual estimates process.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="623667">Although the proclamation of the coming-into-force provision will set into motion the establishment of the refugee appeal division, it should be seen as independent of the royal recommendation and not part of its terms and conditions.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="623668">Our rules and practices hold that coming into force clauses of bills have always been open to amendment and a vote. If we were to accept the argument that an alteration in the coming into force provision would somehow infringe upon the royal recommendation, then it should not be admissible for a committee or the House to negative or amend such a clause unilaterally. Such is clearly not the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623669">Essentially, it is a question of timing. The royal recommendation originally attached to the bill applies, unaltered, to its provisions irrespective of the point in time at which such provisions come into force and, from a procedural standpoint, the alterations to the coming into force provisions of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, as expressed in Bill <Document DbId="2159677" Type="4">C-280</Document>, cannot be seen as infringing on the financial imitative of the Crown.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="623670">Consequently, Bill <Document DbId="2159677" Type="4">C-280</Document> may proceed for debate and a vote at third reading.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623687"> Mr. Speaker, I think in that fashion you have illustrated exactly the kind of behaviour we have been seeing from an opposition that is entirely incapable of articulating an effective issue in the House of Commons and now is resorting to paralyzing the business of government at the committee level. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623688">That is a failure of leadership. It is a further failure of leadership that their leader would come to this House on an alleged question of privilege when in reality it is a crusade by them to persecute members of a committee who are doing their business and doing their business well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623689">The Speaker knows full well that committees are masters of their own business. The Standing Orders and the rules are clear. An appeal to this House in this fashion is entirely out of order. It does not raise a prima facie case of privilege. I am surprised and shocked that the Leader of the Opposition, with his years of experience, is not aware of those very basic rules of procedure in this House of Commons. Apparently he still has a lot to learn in his new job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623690">However, I will reflect that the rules are clear and that it is from the government that a chair is selected. It is from the opposition that a vice-chair is selected and it is from a third party that a second vice-chair is selected. That selection is done by the committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623691">It is clear in this case that the members of the Conservative Party have, with very good reason I might add, a lot of confidence in the chair of that committee, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78597" Type="2">Stormont—Dundas—South Glengarry</Affiliation>, who has conducted himself very well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623692">The Leader of the Opposition may not like the fact that they do not have confidence in him. He might not like the fact that the Conservative Party, the government here, does not have much confidence in his ability as Leader of the Opposition. However, the fact is that it is their privilege to decide who they wish to represent them, the same as it is the privilege of the Liberal Party to decide who they wish to put forward as the vice-chair or who they wish to put forward, for that matter, as their leader. That is the way things work in our democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623693">It is rather presumptuous for them to now want to manage the affairs within the Conservative Party, within the government, but that is the reality of what he is seeking. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623694">As you can see, Mr. Speaker, there is absolutely no question of privilege that arises from this. If there has been any obstruction of the work of the committee, anybody putting up obstacles to the committee proceeding with its business, those obstacles have been put up by an opposition that is taking actions to remove the committee chair and thereby paralyze its ability to continue to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623695">The government members on that committee have made it clear that they continue to have confidence in that member. Those are the rules in the Standing Orders and they should be respected. If they wish to respect those rules and respect the business of the House and the way this House should operate, they should stop playing games at that committee and at so many other committees and now here in the House, respect the rules, respect the confidence that those Conservative members have in their chair and allow them to get on with the business of government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623696">I know getting on with the business of governing is not what the Liberal Party is interested in right now. They are interested in paralyzing the business of government. We have seen it with Bill S-4 where the Liberal senators have refused to do their work for a year. We are seeing it now at committees where the Liberals are again refusing to do their work. It is time that they got on with it and allowed them to do their work.</ParaText>

In my opinion, this situation requires a major intervention.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623704"> If we are master of our own house, does that mean that the chair of a committee can go against the decision of a majority of the committee? The government, with its chair, decided to refuse to hold meetings to discuss the court challenges program. The chair, on his own, refused to hold meetings, when the Government of Canada had paid to have witnesses from Winnipeg appear before the committee. That was paid for by the taxpayers. The Government of Canada paid for witnesses to come from Montreal to testify before the Standing Committee on Official Languages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623705"> I can understand that a chair would have the power to cancel a meeting. For example, if he receives a call informing him that the witnesses are not available, that they missed the plane and there are no witnesses, I can understand that a chair would be given the power to cancel a meeting, but not when he says that it is because of partisanship. Have the Conservatives forgotten that we are doing politics here, that we are in the Parliament of Canada where what we do is debate democratically and make decisions? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623706"> To take away the privilege, our privilege, as members of the Standing Committee on Official Languages, to hear witnesses on a relevant subject such as the court challenges program, that shames our Parliament! It is shameful to do this today, the day on which the Commissioner of Official Languages has condemned the government for what it has done in relation to official languages. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623707"> In order to paralyze our work on that committee, the government is supporting the chair of the Standing Committee on Official Languages and refusing to appoint someone else. How can it say that it is acting democratically? How can it say that it supports the official languages of our country? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623708"> It is shameful that the government is paralyzing its work, when the chair has lost the confidence of the committee. He lost that confidence because he wanted to make a unilateral decision that went against a democratic decision by the majority of the committee: to hold hearings about the court challenges program. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623709"> For these reasons, and because in the past you have said that we were masters of our own house, “the masters of their own house”, there can be no one who decides in the committee’s name. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623710"> I would therefore like you to consider this view, and tell the House what direction it should take. It is unacceptable, in a democracy, for a person in Canada to be able to make decisions in this way and take away our privileges, here, in the Parliament of Canada. We were elected to represent the people from all parts of this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623711"> The government cannot decide to do this because it is being criticized by francophone communities for the cuts it has made. It is being accused of taking away the ultimate tool that gave us schools in Prince Edward Island, Montfort Hospital here in Ottawa, schools in Nova Scotia and British Columbia. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623712"> If it does not like its cuts, it can reinstate the court challenges program. It is unacceptable to paralyze the Standing Committee on Official Languages, to take away our privilege of sitting on the committee, and to refuse to appoint someone to chair it. If it refuses to appoint a chair, that means that it does not support the official languages of our country. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623720">When I had the conversations, which I believe to be private conversations between me and my opposite numbers, concerning the notice of motion that the whip for the New Democratic Party had served that he intended to bring a motion of non-confidence against the chair of the official languages committee, when I had those discussions with my opposite numbers, the whips of the three opposition parties, I assumed that conversation and those discussions were in confidence, the same as we often have confidential conversations. In any event, that has turned out not to be so. My rationale in having those conversations was simply to ensure that there was no ambiguity about the rules.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623721">The rules, as the hon. <Affiliation DbId="105836" Type="4">Leader of the Government in the House of Commons</Affiliation> has stated, are that in the Standing Orders the chair of that particular standing committee is a government member. Those are the rules.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623722">I wanted to ensure that the whips of the other parties, if their members were to support that motion of non-confidence that the whip of the NDP had put forward, if they intended to support that and summarily and arbitrarily dismiss the member for <Affiliation DbId="78597" Type="2">Stormont—Dundas—South Glengarry</Affiliation> from the chair position, that then by the rules of the House, unless a Conservative member was to allow his or her name to stand, the committee would no longer sit. I merely reiterated those rules to the whips and wanted to ensure that there was no question in their minds that this particular action would have that particular consequence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623723">I was not threatening anyone. I did not think that I was posing a threat. I was just saying exactly what would unfold and indeed, that is what has unfolded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623724">The second issue I would like to address, Mr. Speaker, is that we have a tradition in the House of Commons, and I believe at committee, whereby when some members might take personal exception to some remarks or actions that some other member has made, that we respectfully call upon them to explain themselves. We listen to that explanation. Perhaps that member will offer an apology and seek forgiveness, whether it is in this chamber or whether it is in committee. It has happened to me certainly many times in my experience when different members have found themselves in that position over the 14 years I have been here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623725">That did not happen in this particular case. Let us be clear that the hon. whip for the New Democratic Party put forward a motion to remove the chair of the official languages committee. He believed that the opposition members on that committee should act as judge, jury and executioner without even listening to the hon. member's explanation. That was put forward. They debated the decision before they ever arrived at the committee. Before they ever asked him to explain himself, explain his actions, they were already determined to remove him. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623726">I would suggest to you, Mr. Speaker, that that suggests there is a serious problem. When we say that the opposition is playing partisan politics with this particular issue, I would like you to review it. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623731">The reality is, Mr. Speaker, that he still enjoys the support of his colleagues.

The fact of the matter is there are many opposition members sitting on many standing committees that personally I and some of my colleagues take exception to some of the antics they pull on any given day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623735">If I were given my choice, I might even suggest that it might be nice to have certain members removed from committees, but it is not my choice of who the opposition parties choose to have on a specific standing committee. In fact, we have a long-standing tradition that when an opposition party, when any party wants to make a change in its membership on a standing committee what happens by the rules of the House is all four whips sign.</ParaText>

I do not do that. It is not my place to do that.

I do not try and tell them and dictate and say, “Well, I don't like that person's attitude. I don't like what they said the other day. I don't like what they did last week, so we are going to vote them off the island and we are going to have someone else serve as vice-chair”. It is the Liberals' business who they have as vice-chair.

              <ParaText id="623742">I also state, and I will wrap up here, that if the government whip in taking that view is also of the view that he and they, his members, will refuse to perform work on a committee, then that in my view constitutes a constructive obstruction to the work of a committee created by this House and given a mandate by this House.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="623744">Mr. Speaker, I would like to clarify something in this debate. I want to begin by saying that I attended this morning's entire meeting of the Standing Committee on Official Languages. I was there from 9 a.m. until the end. The chief government whip is trying to bet on public opinion. However, there are some facts that the chief government whip cannot deny. Among other things, in this House we have to abide by the Standing Orders. A chair, and even you, Mr. Speaker, in your position as Speaker of the House of Commons, cannot on his or her own initiative rule on a wide range of matters because those matters are included in, limited and governed by the Standing Orders. What happened in the Standing Committee on Official Languages is another illustration of this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623745">Today, this incident happened in the Standing Committee on Official Languages. As a whip, I have complained many times about the behaviour of certain chairs. I do not complain about the person specifically, but that the person filling the role of chair, who is part of the government, thinks he is above the rules. That is why we consistently ask the chair to verify regulatory and legal aspects with the committee clerk, who is not partisan. In most cases, our clerks are very qualified. They are the guardians and custodians of the rules that govern us in the House and in committee. Unfortunately, the chairs think they are above the rules and they ignore advice from the clerks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623746">Let us put things back in perspective. The government whip may attempt to stir a public opinion battle through the media, but there are facts that cannot be denied. These are undeniable facts. The chair of the Standing Committee on Official Languages lost the support of the majority of members on the committee. What does that mean? What happens when the chair of a committee has lost the support of its members? Must we keep him on? Should we turn a blind eye? Do we sweep the dust under the rug, figuring that it was just a bad patch, and forget about it? I am sorry, but what happened at the Standing Committee on Official Languages was decided by the members of that committee, who felt that enough was enough and that this chair did not deserve the confidence of the committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623747">Our Standing Orders are clear. Standing Order 106(2) states, and I quote:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623748">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">At the commencement of every session and, if necessary, during the course of a session, each standing or special committee shall elect a Chair and two Vice-Chairs, of whom the Chair shall be a Member of the government party, the first Vice-Chair shall be a Member of the Official Opposition, and the second Vice-Chair shall be a Member of an opposition party other than the Official Opposition party.—</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623749">I will dispense with the rest of the standing order in question. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623750">The chair having lost the confidence of the committee, a motion was put forward by the whip for the NDP. Members from the Liberal Party and the Bloc Québécois voted in support of the motion, and the member from the NDP also voted in support of his own motion. The Conservatives voted against it. How do the votes tally up? Because he is in government, the government whip would have wanted to disregard the outcome of the vote and say that, even though there were seven votes against four, the four won over the seven. I have never been good at math, but I would say, based on the law of numbers, that seven is more than four.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="45">(1545)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="623751"> The situation of a minority government is special, but it looks as though the Conservative government has not yet understood that. In committee, as in this House, when the three opposition parties unite, the government cannot pass what it wants. This is the reality of a minority government. The committees are made up as follows: there are five Conservative MPs—including a chair, four Liberal MPs, two from the Bloc and one from the NDP. Which means that sometimes we vote seven to four. The opposition parties do not always have to stand together. Sometimes one opposition party votes with the government and it is defeated. Other times, one party finds itself alone with its own motion. This is the reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623752"> I will end by explaining that this morning we lost confidence in the chair and we tried to elect a new chair of the Standing Committee on Official Languages. We offered the position to four members of the Conservative Party: the member for <Affiliation DbId="78507" Type="2">Beauport—Limoilou</Affiliation>, the member for <Affiliation DbId="79030" Type="2">Louis-Hébert</Affiliation> and two other members whose riding names I have forgotten. They all refused. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623753"> This is understandable when the person is unable to accept. Did they refuse voluntarily or did they refuse as the result of instructions from the whip? The <Affiliation DbId="105846" Type="96">chief government whip</Affiliation>—and he will recall—has already told me that, if we wanted to bring a chair down, all the others would refuse. So this is the situation we are in. All the others refused; the committee is not dissolved, but it is suspended.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623754"> As parliamentarians, we will have to decide what to do to clear the impasse. The <Affiliation DbId="105846" Type="96">chief government whip</Affiliation>, however, had told me that this is what would happen. It was already written in the big book. What happened this morning was not a surprise. I therefore support the question of privilege tabled by the <Affiliation DbId="105459" Type="96">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation>.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623756">Furthermore, the <Affiliation DbId="105846" Type="96">Chief Government Whip</Affiliation> is saying that our conversation was private and confidential.

              <ParaText id="623759">Let us make no mistake, this is a partisan issue and everyone here knows it, whether they are willing to admit it or not. Again, I would reiterate the comments of my colleague.</ParaText>

                <B>Mr. Tom Lukiwski:</B> I listened with patience and with tolerance to other comments and I would expect the members opposite to give me the same consideration. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623762">Without question, everyone here knows that this is not a matter of not having confidence in the chair. This is a political matter. We have had a rash of non-confidence motions in the chairs of committees over the past little while. In fact there is a motion right now for yet another committee, the Standing Committee on International Trade, to express non-confidence in the chair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623763">There is no other reason for this except that the opposition, first, is trying to embarrass the government, and second, is trying to take control of the committees by changing the Standing Orders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623764">I also want to take issue with a comment by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation> who asked, in respect to the hon. government House whip's comments about the fact that a Conservative chair needs to be reappointed or re-elected, whether the official whip knew that the rules are that this is an election, not an appointment process. That is very true but we must have a government member allow their names to be forward. They have complete confidence in the current chair and they do not want to put their names forward. That is where it stands right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623765"> Those are the rules and the Standing Orders. In fact, if one were to accept the logic of the members of the opposition who basically seem to be saying that in committee and in all other parts of the Parliament, if the opposition vote as a majority to either change a chair or change Standing Orders, we should allow it be done, let me just pose a question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623766">We are in a minority government right now but what would happen in the case of a majority government? Would government members be able to stand in this House and say, “Mr. Speaker, we want to change a number of standing orders and, by the way, we also want to curtail debate on the legislation before you, and, by a majority vote, if we win that will happen”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623767">It would be a very efficient way to govern but it would not be very democratic, which is what is happening here. They are trying to ignore Standing Orders for political purposes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623768">Mr. Speaker, I beseech you to not get caught up in this partisan attack on chairs we have elected and who should regain the confidence of all committee members.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623770">Mr. Speaker, I would like to offer some clarification that is at the source of this debate; specifically, why we asked the chair of the Standing Committee on Official Languages to resign. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623771"> It was a majority decision. The three opposition parties agreed to do it. I must say that it is rare for the three opposition parties to agree, but in this case, they did. The chair of the Standing Committee on Official Languages cancelled the meeting last Tuesday without giving any reason or prior notice to the members. We found out exactly two minutes before 9 o’clock, when we should have been starting the meeting. He also cancelled the following meeting, which was scheduled for last Thursday. It is my understanding that only reason we had a meeting this morning is that I was able to put forward a motion to have a meeting. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623772">We asked the chair to resign because he did not have the confidence of the members of the committee. The members of the committee elected that chair because the members form a unit and they work together, as a team. That means that the work of the committee must be done together. What happened is that the chair made a decision last Tuesday without consulting the members of the committee and without advising them. The chair is elected by the members and is accountable to the members. In my view, what happens in Parliament—and I include the House and the committees of the House--must, at all times, be democratic. I apologize for the cliché, but the eyes of the nation are upon us. What happens here must be as democratic as possible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623773"> On one hand, the chair first decided to cancel two meetings without informing the members; without giving them any reason for the cancellation. On the other hand, this morning’s meeting was divided in two; there was a change in the agenda for the second part. It was cancelled once again without informing the members and without asking for their views. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623774"> I believe this clarification was important. It is not because we wanted to take down the chair. It was not because we were angry over anything; it is because, in our opinion, the partisan strategies of the chair could not be considered acceptable in a committee that calls itself democratic </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623777">I will conclude by saying that we should not forget that the fundamental issue was that we were supposed to hear witnesses on the court challenges program, which the government abolished. We wanted to know what ordinary citizens thought of that decision. Abolishing the court challenges program was a partisan decision. That is why the committee's partisan members wanted to hear these witnesses.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623788">One of my colleagues from the Liberal Party in the previous intervention talked about the lack of confidence in the chair and said that the eyes of the nation are upon us. I certainly believe that is the situation in the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623789">People watching back home must have been wondering about the cluster of Reform Party members in the previous debate licking their wounds in outraged indignation. It reminded me of when I was a kid and Gilles “The Fish” Poisson once lost a Texas cage match to “Killer” Kowalski and he talked about how he had been hard done by. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623790"> As serious as the issues are, they are sometimes somewhat surreal. I think people back home wonder exactly what we are debating here because we seem to be in a bubble sometimes, separated from the reality of working people and their workplace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623791">I want to speak to this bill in terms of concrete examples. I am going to focus specifically on how a bill like this would be enacted. It is all very well to talk about the need for an international convention on the settlement of investment disputes because these happen all over the place and we need to set some high standards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623792">In recent years, and particularly with the chapter 11 case with NAFTA, we have seen some very disturbing trends emerging. The New Democratic Party members will certainly be voting against this bill because we have concerns about the lack of transparency, the lack of accessibility, and the lack of accountability. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623793">When we talk about protecting investments overseas and in Canada, we are talking about how it needs to be based on the rule of law. We certainly believe that law is a guiding principle, but there are a number of principles about law that have to be applied. A number of the dispute mechanisms seem to be basically circumventing some of the basic principles of law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623794">If there were to be a dispute in court, the interested parties should be able to speak to it. That is a fundamental principle of law. We do not see that, for example, in chapter 11 of NAFTA. We did not see that in what was laid out in the multi-lateral investment agreement that came out in 1997. There needs to be a transparency of judgments, and yet with this ICSID bill that is before us there is no obligation to even publish the evidence and the awards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623795">One of the most fundamental issues in terms of legal jurisprudence is the need for transparency and full disclosure of evidence, so that evidence can be weighed publicly, not behind closed doors. There is a fundamental difference between being judged by a jury of peers in one's community and being judged by a couple of buddies in a backroom.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623796">I am going to speak about a specific case and how I see it unfolding under chapter 11 because I believe it resonates the application for applying the principles on a larger scale. That case is the $350 million claim against the Government of Canada by one Vito G. Gallo. I have his request for arbitration under chapter 11 of the free trade agreement. I have read Mr. Gallo's claim from start to finish and it is very interesting. I know most of the case fairly well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623797"> He says he is the sole owner of 1532382 Ontario Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of the province of Ontario. I would agree that this company is incorporated in Ontario. I would also agree with him that the Adams Mine, a former iron ore mine, is located 10 kilometres southeast of the town of Kirkland Lake. That is in my riding. Other than that I would question most of the evidence that he has brought forward to the arbitration dispute panel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623798">That gets back to the issue under Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document> about the need to fully disclose evidence. For example, in Mr. Gallo's claim, he states that he owns and controls the enterprise, meaning the Adams Mine as a possible site for landfill. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="00">(1600)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="623799">I find that very interesting. We have to go back a bit into the history of this site. In 1990 Dofasco shut down the Adams Mine. It was an iron ore operation in my riding which lost a number of good paying jobs. The issue then became its possible use as a landfill, but the landfill was fairly challenged because we had 360 million litres of groundwater flowing through it every year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623800">At that time the owners were Notre Development, a small company out of North Bay, and the City of Toronto, which was a partner. The city of Toronto paid for most of the initial costs. It was the taxpayers in Toronto, not investors, who paid for the studies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623801">The studies were based on an unproven concept called hydraulic containment. It stated that 360 million litres of groundwater, which people in my riding contended fed the entire agricultural belt in the valley below, flowed through the pits every year. The theory was that pipes would be installed and for 1,000 years the groundwater of northern Ontario would be used to wash 20 years worth of garbage. It was seen then as somewhat of a cockamamie plan, but the city of Toronto paid for the studies to get this to ground level.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623802">In 1997 it went before an environmental assessment board in Ontario at a time when Premier Mike Harris, who was considered a very close supporter of the dump, changed the environmental assessment act in Ontario, and changed it dramatically. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623803">We suddenly had a scoped EA for what would be the single largest dump project in Canadian and possibly North American history. It was subject to a very narrowly scoped EA, which looked at only the question of whether the computer models supplied by the proponent were feasible. At that time all the other issues of groundwater contamination and the potential threat in the surrounding environment were ignored.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623804">It was actually passed at that time in a very narrowly focused area, but there were issues with 2 of the 12 or 13 drill holes. There were two serious questions about whether those proved the theory of this dump or they did not. I am explaining this just as background so everyone has the full sense of what I am talking about in terms of this multilateral investment agreement that we are looking at now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623805">The city of Toronto stepped back and decided it was no longer going to be a proponent. Therefore, it was no longer the key proponent, but it was possibly a customer for this site. Throughout this, it was an Ontario company bidding on a municipal contract. There was no discussion at any point that this was in any way an international project. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623806">In 2000 the city of Toronto walked away from this proposal because of the dangerous issues of liability. Nobody wanted to accept the liability for having to guarantee that pumps on a theoretically unproven site could run for 1,000 years. It also stepped aside because it was probably the largest civil disobedience action in Ontario history at that point. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623807">The federal and provincial governments were very cognizant of the fact that the Algonquin nation had brought forward a very serious prima facie case for unextinguished aboriginal title at that site. There were numerous questions, as well as the potential groundwater threat from this unproven site.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623808">The city of Toronto was not willing to accept the liability. Canadian Waste Services at that time, which was the new partner, also walked away, so the site was left without a customer. If we check the records for the last seven years, regardless of what happened with Michigan, the city of Toronto said time and time again, “We will never go back to this site. No matter what, we will never go back there”. It was a site without a customer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623809">Then in 2002-03 a new company was formed, which was 1532382 Ontario Inc. It set itself up as the new proponent. What is this company? We do not really know. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623810">I have a corporation profile report. What is the jurisdiction for 1532382 Ontario Inc.? It is Ontario. What is the former jurisdiction? It is not applicable. The corporation type is an Ontario business corporation. What is its registered address? It is Suite 101, Don Mills, Ontario. Its mailing address is 225 Duncan Mill Road, Suite 101, Don Mills, Ontario. If you are not seeing much of an international investor angle here, you are like me, Mr. Speaker. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="623811">Page 2 of this very paltry corporate report says that the administrator is Brent W. Swanick. His address is 104 Yorkminster Road, North York, Ontario. The first director is not applicable. The officer type is president. The resident is Canadian.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623812">We do not see anything on this paltry two page report of any connection as to who is behind this Ontario numbered company, a company that picked up a site that was derelict, that had no customers and no possibility of a customer. Then it decided to go into business to bid on a municipal contract. We have an Ontario numbered company bidding under the province of Ontario for a municipal contract. The only contract it could get from the city of Toronto was that it would not deal with the company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623813">The deal was contingent upon two key issues, and they are raised in NAFTA chapter 11 challenge. First was the fact that it applied for a take water permit in 2003. The second issue was that it applied through the MNR to purchase 2,000 acres of Crown land at what we thought was the outrageously low price of $22 an acre. In fact, I helped initiate a local bidding campaign that said we would spend $5 to $10 more an acre and we would outbid it. There is a fundamental principle. If we are to dispose of Crown land assets in the province of Ontario, we have to go through due diligence and bring this out into the public. We cannot simply do this behind the scenes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623814">The other issue with this 2,000 acres was it was subject to a land claim issue with the Algonquin nation. It came forward very clearly with its prima facie evidence that said that there had been no consultation with the nation. It said that it had be consulted. Therefore, it was an obligation of the Ontario government to hold up the disposal of the Crown land until that was addressed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623815">The other issue that was very pertinent at the time was whether the take water permit at the site should have been allowed. On August 12, 2003, Dr. Ken Howard, who has been recognized as the key hydrogeologist in the province of Ontario, was brought in to review the information. Dr. Ken Howard was also brought in to deal with Walkerton and was the key provincial guy for bringing forward all the recommendations for provincial legislation out of the Walkerton report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623816"> He studied the Adams Mine environmental assessment process. He said that the decision to issue the certificate at that site specifically was based on the results of drill holes 98-1 and 98-2. He concluded that the drill hole results were “seriously deficient” and that the director of approvals branch approved the dump on evidence that “had virtually no scientific merit” and were “effectively worthless”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623817">We will not find that in my mysterious friend Vito Gallo's submission. Neither will we find any of the issues before the NAFTA tribunal about this first nations land issue or the fact that there was widespread opposition to this plan or the  fact that  there was no customer. However, that might not matter. Under chapter 11, a mysterious numbered company is going before a tribunal and saying it wants a dispute mechanism where all this evidence does not come through and the public interest does not get to be heard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623818">The other question I find really interesting in this is I have never heard of Vito Gallo. Now maybe that is not an uncommon thing. There are lots of people of whom have not heard, but I have heard of many of the people who have been involved in the Adams Mine over the years because I have paid very close attention to it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623819">For example, I was very aware of the Cortellucci group of companies out of southern Ontario. In the May 9, 2003 issue of the <I>Toronto Star</I> they were identified as key owners of this Adams Mine proposal. In fact, Mr. Mario Cortellucci has given serious amounts of money through clan Cortellucci to the Conservative government. However, I am not bringing that up here because I am not being partisan. I am just pointing that out as a side issue. When Mr. Cortellucci was asked by the <I>Toronto Star</I> if he was in fact the owner of the Adams Mine at that point, he said he was just one of a dozen or so investors. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="623820">Now we have a situation where we have this numbered company. We do not know what it is except we know it is an Ontario company run by an Ontario administrator. Maybe we have no I.D. to prove this, but this man is purporting to be an American who has international rights to come in because he has been circumvented in all his other points. There are questions about who else is involved in this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623821">We know the Cortellucci Group of Companies was identified. In 2003 a lawsuit was launched by Canada Waste Services over the ownership of the site. It never mentioned Vito Gallo, but it mentioned the Notre Development Corporation and the Cortellucci Group of Companies. In fact, it referred to the Cortellucci agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623822">We would think it would be incumbent upon the Government of Canada, before we fork out $350 million to Vito, my friend, to find out who is behind this numbered company. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623823">We do not know if any of the due diligence has been done. All we know is this numbered company tried to sue the Ontario government in 2003-04, after it was shut down when the provincial Liberal government revoked the permit based on a number of key issues. The first was new evidence. The second was as a result of the Walkerton inquiry. It was the idea that in Ontario in the 21st century we did not use groundwater to wash garbage. It is kind of an odious thought. Ontario decided that is not even a 20th century idea and it is not even a 19th century idea. We do not use groundwater to wash garbage. Therefore, it suspended the permit, not just for that site, but for any site in Ontario on the bases that we do not use a lake full of fresh groundwater in which to throw our garbage. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623824">At that point this numbered company, 1532382 Ontario Inc., sued the Ontario government, which is fair. They are investors. They took their case of $300 million and they went against the Ontario government. However, we did not see that case go anywhere. Nothing seemed to happen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623825">We know there were some negotiations with some of the investors about whether to accept a payout. Then, lo and behold, just a few months ago, Vito G. Gallo said that he owned the mine, that he was the direct beneficiary of all the possible benefits that should have accrued, going back to when Toronto was paying for the cost. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623826">We had no evidence to know at what point Vito Gallo stepped into the Adams Mine. We do not know if Vito Gallo is the only investor. We do not know if Vito Gallo is one of a hundred investors, one of ten investors, or one of five investors. We do know this company that he says he owned as an American investor is an Ontario numbered company. It was an Ontario numbered company bidding under provincial rules for a municipal waste contract in the province of Ontario. There was nothing international about this whatsoever. Yet he is now before a NAFTA tribunal, asking for $350 million, and the Canadian taxpayers will not have our lawyers there bringing forward witnesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623827">One would think that if we are going to talk about international trade law that has jurisprudence on its side and accountability and fairness, then fairness would include the right of a domestic government to bring forward legislation that is fair. If it does affect business, there is a process. However, the government might have compelling reasons, such as Dr. Howard's evidence, to act on this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623828"> Another doctor I would like to mention is Dr. Larry Jensen. He is the provincial geologist for the Kirkland Lake region. He spent 40 years studying the faults of the Adams Mine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623829"> I found it absolutely strange when I was at the environmental assessment hearing and I looked at the maps of the experts which showed all the fault lines. They were very vague. There was hardly anything there. In fact, they were not Dr. Jensen's maps; they were maps from the 1950s.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623830">I will conclude on this. Dr. Larry Jensen was a the provincial geologist in the Kirkland Lake region for 40 years. He studied the Adams Mine every day. He said that the Adams Mine proposal was,</ParaText>

In the end, it is just a tribunal. In my opinion, it is not necessarily the tribunal that presents a problem, but the poor investment protection treaties Canada negotiates and signs without the House's approval. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623835">Consequently, does he not believe that this convention, which could be signed with the adoption of Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document>, could protect Canadian investments abroad and also protect Canada and other countries against investments? As I said, the centre is just a tribunal. The treaties Canada signs are not necessarily the best and should have tougher conditions with more bite. Because if necessary, the tribunal could put things right again.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623836">Mr. Speaker, the issue for us is the tribunal process is not substantive in itself, but it has the potential, and I think a very bad potential, to lock in bad financial agreements and make them worse. That is why we oppose this. The example we use is NAFTA. We believe that NAFTA was put in place to give us a rules based sense of trade. If we are to have international trade, there has to be rules based trade.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623837">We have seen how chapter 11 has been used and how it takes away the legitimate ability of a government to bring forth evidence as to why it has made decisions. If it is being used to simply penalize one company and to go after it, fair enough. Under the rule of law the evidence could be brought forward to substantiate that. However, what was to be the multilateral investment agreement was very similar to chapter 11. We believe the tribunal process is a continuation of basically a bad principle of reporting investor rights above the notion that investor rights are part of a larger common framework of rights in any functioning democracy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623838">Mr. Speaker, the story we have heard from the member for <Affiliation DbId="78395" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> is one of the most incredible tales I have ever heard in my life. I was spellbound by it. It is like an epic saga. My colleague has a background in the arts. I think he should write an epic poem about the saga of the Adams mine along the lines <I>Beowulf</I> or something like that. This is unbelievable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623839">I want to ask my colleague if I understood this correctly, because it is almost an unbelievable story. Does the member mean to say that we have a Canadian businessman, given investor state status through NAFTA, suing the nation state of Canada, or Ontario, for lost opportunity because he cannot do what he wants to do in this mine that he says he owns? Is that how convoluted our international trade agreements are?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623840">First, do I understand that he is not even an American, that he is not an out of country businessman who has lost opportunity in this country, but rather a Canadian who somehow calls himself an American and says he has been inconvenienced and has lost $350 million worth of lost opportunity? Is that how twisted this story really is?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623841">Mr. Speaker, just to clarify this, Vito Gallo, the mysterious Vito, is an American as far as we know, but we do not know anything about him. We do not know any details. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623842">He is claiming to be the sole owner of a derelict site through a numbered company registered in Ontario. There is nothing about this company that shows any kind of American investments at all. In fact, there is only one investment I have seen that it has made, other than apparently buying into the Adams Mine, which is that the 1532382 company gave political donations to the Conservative leadership in Ontario through this numbered company that is now being claimed as an American investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623843">So there is certainly the question of what it was doing giving political donations through this group of companies, but through this dispute mechanism how do we even know who the owners are? There is no obligation under international trade to reveal this to the public or to bring forward evidence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623844"> Therefore, we have a situation where there could be one, two or a dozen investors. We do not know if he is a small investor or the sole investor. He is claiming to be the sole investor right now. Again, the <I>Toronto Star</I> of May 9, 2003, said that Mario Cortellucci from Vaughan township was one of the key owners of that site.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623845">We certainly think that basic jurisprudence would call for a forensic audit of this company to be made public before we would agree to submit to any kind of international dispute tribunal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623846"> There is one final point on this question. Under this consent to arbitration, the plaintiff gets to ask for his own arbiter. He has asked for Professor Jean-Gabriel Castel from Orangeville, Ontario, so I find this situation even stranger. We do not even have a full court of law with full evidence so we do not know much. We know there is a numbered company in Ontario that is asking to have one out of the two or one out of the three arbiters picked by the company, this for $350 million of taxpayers' money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623847">It is an incredible tale. As for the government sitting back and allowing that to happen, when we think of this money that could be spent on Kelowna or on public transit but that might be going out the window and through a back door process under NAFTA to a donor to the Conservative Party, it is an incredible story. I agree. It is an incredible story.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623848">Mr. Speaker, I found the specific case very interesting, but the member has raised a point about chapter 11. I guess the rhetorical question is whether or not there is any confidence that the NAFTA dispute resolution mechanism works.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623849">I do note that the ICSID option is already available and exists under NAFTA, but it is only available where the state making the investment and the state in which the investment is located both are parties to ICSID and to NAFTA. The only NAFTA partner that is a member of ICSID right now happens to be the United States, so that is not applicable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623850">Should Canada become a member, even under NAFTA the ICSID option would then be available, which is kind of interesting, because it basically provides that in countries where Canadian investors might lack confidence in the court system, which is part of the story the member has raised, there is ICSID's prohibition on court review, which, with its links to the World Bank as well, actually would appear to significantly improve the prospects of any arbitral award to be enforced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623851">I am not sure how the member feels about that, but it would appear that it means options for Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623852">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the member's question, but the issue we are looking at here is that we believe chapter 11 has failed some of the basic tests of allowing for a fair and open study of whether or not a particular company has been aggrieved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623853">As for this new dispute mechanism, it looks to us as though we are being asked to go from one really ugly dance partner to an uglier dance partner. We feel the situation could be improved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623854">We have to go with some fundamental principles. Again, there has to be open access for all interested parties. There has to be the open and full disclosure of all evidence being brought forward. There has to be the clear transparency of judges. Simply having a dispute panel working behind the scenes whereby people actually get to suggest their own arbitrators is not sufficient, especially when we have the public interest at stake, and, in this case, clean groundwater and $350 million of Canadian taxpayers' money that is on the hook.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623855">Right now I do not feel any more confident about going under the proposal that is under Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document> than I do going under chapter 11 of NAFTA. They are both flawed attempts to override the ability of a sovereign state to come forward in a House like this with clear legislation to protect the best interests of its citizens.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623857">Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to confirm that the Bloc Québécois supports Bill C-53 in principle. I would also like to suggest to my colleague in the NDP that he should introduce the adjustments he would like to see in committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623858"> The passage of this bill will enable Canada to ratify the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States and join the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623859"> I will certainly be referring to this centre in my speech, and since it has a rather long name, I will just call it ICSID. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623860"> Bill C-53 incorporates the requirements of the convention into our domestic law, especially in regard to ensuring that arbitration awards are upheld and granting ICSID and its staff the immunities they need. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623861"> ICSID was established in 1965 by the World Bank under the Washington Treaty. One hundred and fifty-six countries are currently members. ICSID arbitrates disputes between states and foreign investors. These disputes can be of two kinds: first, disputes over compliance with bilateral foreign investment protection agreements, and second, disputes involving agreements between governments and foreign investors. The Government of Quebec regularly concludes agreements of this kind, encouraging foreign investment through promises, for example, to provide electricity at a particular price. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623862"> Canada joining ICSID will have no effect on the provinces and Quebec, except that they too will be able to provide for recourse to ICSID in the agreements they reach with investors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623863"> The bilateral treaties binding on the federal government already provide for recourse to ICSID arbitration, although by means of a complementary arbitration system rather than the regular system, which is only available to countries that have ratified the convention. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623864"> The only thing that Canada’s joining ICSID will change is that Canada will be able to participate in the negotiations to amend the ICSID convention or regulations and rules and will be assured of being able to participate in the appointment of arbitration tribunals. Canada will therefore be able to participate directly in ICSID. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623865"> Ultimately, ICSID is only a tribunal. The problem, however, is not the tribunal but the bad treaties that Canada signs to protect investment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623866"> The Bloc Québécois supports the negotiation of investment protection agreements provided, of course, that they are good agreements. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623867"> It is completely natural for investors, before making an investment, to try and make sure they will not be divested of their property or that they will not become victims of discrimination. This is the sort of situation that foreign investment protection agreements are meant to cover.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623868"> This is not a new idea. The first known agreement that included provisions relating to protection of foreign investments was signed between France and the United States in 1788, more than two centuries ago. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623869"> In the world today, there are more than 2,400 bilateral investment protection agreements. If we include the tax treaties that deal with the tax treatment of investments and foreign income, we find about 5,000 bilateral treaties concerning foreign investment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623870"> The Bloc is in favour of negotiating such agreements and we recognize that they promote investment and growth. These agreements are almost all based on the same principles. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="623871"> First, there is a respect for property rights regardless of the owner’s nationality. Second, there can be no nationalization without fair and prompt financial compensation. Third, there is a prohibition against treating property located within a country’s territory differently depending on the owner's origins. Finally, there is free movement of capital resulting from the operation and the disposal of investment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623872"> In every case, when these rights are not respected, states may submit disputes over compliance with an agreement to an international arbitration tribunal. In the majority of cases, investors, themselves, may submit the dispute to an international tribunal, but only with the consent of the state. In many cases, the international arbitration provided in the agreement takes place before ICSID. By agreeing to this, as Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document> provides, we are also agreeing to an international order in the field of investment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623873"> In the investment protection agreements that they sign, only two countries, Canada and the United States, systematically grant investors the right to appeal directly to international tribunals. This is a deviation from the norm. By allowing a company to operate outside government control, it is being given the status of a subject of international law, a status that ordinarily belongs only to governments. The agreements that Canada signs contain a number of similar deviations that give multinationals rights they should not have and that limit the power of the state to legislate and take action for the common good. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623874">The investments chapter of NAFTA, chapter 11, provides that a dispute can go to ICSID. That chapter is a bad agreement in three respects: the definition of expropriation, the definition of investor and the definition of investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623875">The definition of expropriation is so vague that any government measure—except for a general tax measure—can be challenged by a foreign investor if it diminishes the profits generated by the investment. A plan to implement the Kyoto accord, which would have major polluters such as oil companies pay dearly, could be challenged under chapter 11 and result in government compensation. American companies have majority interests in Alberta oil companies. Chapter 11 opens the door to the most improper legal disputes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623876">The definition of investor is so broad that it includes any shareholder. Therefore anyone could take the state to court and attempt to obtain compensation for a government measure that allegedly reduced a company’s profits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623877">As for the definition of investment, it too is so broad that it even includes the future profits that an investor hopes to earn. In the case of expropriation, not only does the state find itself forced to pay fair market value, but it must also include revenues that the investor expects to earn in future. It would no longer be possible to nationalize electricity, as Quebec did in the 1960s.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623878">Take the example of SunBelt, a corporation with a Canadian shareholder and a Californian shareholder. The corporation closed its doors when the Government of British Columbia withdrew the right it had granted for the bulk export of water. The Canadian shareholder, based on Canadian laws, received compensation equivalent to the value of his investment, or $300,000. The American shareholder, based on NAFTA chapter 11, included potential future revenue in its claim: $100 million. For better or for worse, the case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="623879"> Given the amounts of money in issue, chapter 11 is a deterrent to any government action, particularly in relation to the environment, whose effect would be to reduce the profits of a foreign-owned corporation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623880"> As well, the dispute resolution mechanism allows corporations to apply directly to the international tribunals to seek compensation, without even getting the consent of the state. How is it conceivable that a multinational could, on its own authority, create a trade dispute between two countries? And yet this is the absurd situation that the investment chapter of NAFTA permits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623881"> Given these flaws, chapter 11 of NAFTA reduces the state’s capacity to take action for the common good and to legislate about the environment, and is a Damocles’ sword that could come crashing down at any moment on any legislative or regulatory measures whose effect was to reduce corporations’ profits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623882"> In 2005, the United States changed some of the provisions in their standard form investment protection agreement. In 2006, Canada followed suit. Since both countries have now acknowledged the harmful and extreme nature of chapter 11 of NAFTA, the time is ripe for the government to move quickly to enter into discussions with its American and Mexican partners to amend chapter 11 of NAFTA</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623883"> We say no to bad investment protection agreements. In addition to chapter 11 of NAFTA, and although its extreme nature has been widely decried, the government has entered into 16 other bilateral foreign investment agreements, carbon copies of chapter 11. All of these foreign investment agreements are faulty and should be renegotiated. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623884">In 2006, the government recognized to some degree that these agreements were bad. Copying the amendments made by the Bush administration the previous year, the Conservative government made changes to its FIPA program to correct the most obvious shortcomings. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623885"> It clarified the concept of expropriation by specifying that a non-discriminatory government measure that is intended to protect health and the environment or to promote a legitimate government objective should not be considered as expropriation and should not automatically generate compensation. It is too soon to evaluate the real impact of that clarification, but at first glance, it looks like an improvement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623886">it restricted the concept of investment by specifying that the value of property is equal to its fair market value. That put an end to the folly of adding together all the potential profits that an investor might hope to earn from an investment. As for the rest, the standard investment protection agreement continues to be based on chapter 11 of NAFTA.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623887">The government must continue to improve this standard agreement, particularly in terms of dispute settlement mechanisms. Multinational corporations must be brought under the authority of the state, like any other citizen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623888"> Also, the government should submit international treaties and agreements to the House of Commons before ratifying them. At the start of the year, the government sent out a news release to announce that it had just ratified a new foreign investment protection agreement with Peru. It was only by reading that news release that parliamentarians and the public became aware of this agreement. Parliament was never informed and never approved it. That is completely anti-democratic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623889"> Yet, the Conservative platform in the last election was clear: the Conservatives made a commitment to submit all international treaties and agreements for approval before ratifying them. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="623890">Since the Conservatives took office, Canada has signed 24 international treaties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623891">With the exception of the amendment to the NATO treaty, for which a mini-debate and a vote took place at the last minute, none of these international treaties were presented to the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623892">Today, the consequences of international agreements on our lives are comparable to those that legislation may have. Nothing, absolutely nothing justifies the government quietly signing such agreements unilaterally, by going over the heads of people's representatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623893">The Bloc Québécois has introduced bills in the past to restore democracy and ensure the respect of Quebec and provincial jurisdictions in the conclusion of international treaties. Since the government promised to do this, we did not bring the issue up again at the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623894">We are now seeing that the word of the Conservatives is not worth very much. The Bloc Québécois will raise this issue again and will bring forward proposals to restore democracy in the conclusion of international treaties. Such proposals will include requiring the government to present to the House all international treaties and agreements it has signed before ratifying them, requiring the government to publish all international agreements by which it is bound, requiring the vote and approval of the House following an analysis by a special committee tasked with examining international agreements and major treaties before the government may ratify them, and calling on the government to respect Quebec and provincial jurisdictions in the entire process of concluding treaties, that is, all stages of negotiation, signing and ratification.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623895">In conclusion, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes is indeed necessary to ensure that the states are treated fairly by multinational corporations. We must also ensure that the agreements signed by Canada are good agreements that respect all the stakeholders.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623896">Mr. Speaker, my Bloc colleague's comments raised as many questions as they gave information about the view of this very complex international convention. The points made by the previous speaker, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78395" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation>, cited a number of very legitimate concerns and provided reasons why the NDP will oppose Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623897"> The NDP is very concerned that the ICSID falls under the jurisdiction of the World Bank, an organization that the NDP has cited numerous concerns about in the past, partly in terms of transparency but also in terms accessibility for users of this tribunal process, this quasi-judicial arbitration process. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623898">I am concerned that the House of Commons today, as we entertain Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document>, is not digging deep enough into how we envision this tribunal unfolding and the precedent setting status that it will have. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623899">One of the most alarming concerns that I would like my colleague to comment on is that one of the arguments used by the government in favour of ratifying the international convention is that ICSID shelters foreign investors from the courts of any country or jurisdiction in which the investment is made. I thought we would be alarmed that we are setting up some kind of a dual parallel process that will shelter investors from the courts in the jurisdiction in which the investment is taking place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623900">In other words, this quasi-judicial arbitration process being set up by the World Bank will have precedence and primacy over the courts of the provinces of Quebec or Manitoba or the Federal Court if it, in fact, is an investment in the federal jurisdiction. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623901">Are we prepared to cede that jurisdiction to an outside party such as the World Bank? Is our confidence in the World Bank such that we are willing to forgo our own court's jurisdiction? If we are interested in the best interests of Canadians, we should be throwing our confidence and faith in our own court system and let this foreign investor be judged by our high standards instead of a new arbitration process, which will likely be residenced in Washington, D.C. and under the jurisdiction of the World Bank.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623902">Mr. Speaker, all the agreements that Canada has signed on the protection of foreign investment have major deficiencies and are based to some extent on NAFTA chapter 11. As I said in my speech, most of the agreements Canada has signed are bad. A tribunal such as ICSID, which is the subject of Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document>, will always judge, treat and evaluate things on the basis of the agreement that was signed between the two countries. We are talking here about Canadian foreign investment. One hundred and fifty-six countries have signed this convention and can go directly to the ICSID tribunal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623903"> We have international relations and Canadian foreign investment. I understand that the laws of Canada and of the various provinces and Quebec take priority when we are dealing with people who are here. However, when we are dealing with foreigners, we need some basis. This basis is primarily the agreements that have been signed. Everything depends on that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623904"> As I said and say once again, this is just a tribunal. There are also the agreements that were signed, and unfortunately, most of them are bad. They should all be renegotiated, just like chapter 11 of NAFTA. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623905"> This is the basis on which people can at least seek justice on the international scene for Canadian foreign investment. I do not think that the reverse happens very often because I hope that Canada treats foreign investors fairly. It does not allow them to do everything they want, of course, whenever they want, or to be more important and take precedence over all the laws and regulations of Canada, which must be obeyed. Justice should always be done, therefore, on the basis of the international agreements that were negotiated but are mostly bad. In the future, all these agreements should be submitted to the House so that we can evaluate them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623906"> That being said, I would tell the NDP member that he should table the amendments to Bill <Document DbId="2810127" Type="3">C-53</Document>; that would reassure them. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="623907">Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to my Bloc colleague's dissertation and certainly the rule of law is fundamental to any international trade agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623908">What we are talking about, though, is whether or not the rules' mechanism that is in place now is adequate and is on a fair and level playing field. For example, the courts have defined a corporation as a person. Now we are defining it basically as a nation state where it seems to have equal status and maybe even superior status because of the investment protection that we are giving to corporations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623909">Under NAFTA we are now allowing the principle that an investor in a company is somehow eligible to claim these nation-state cases. For example, the mysterious Vito G. Gallo and this 1532382 Ontario Inc. are suing the Canadian people for $350 million. That will be perfectly acceptable under NAFTA because it seems that, if anything, it is weighted continually on the side of the investor and not on fair jurisprudence, which takes one competing interest against another and balances them out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623910">We do not see those in the trade agreement. It is all fine and well to say that the trade agreements might not have been great and that we should renegotiate them but I would say, fat chance. Why should we renegotiate them when we are putting in place further issues that down the road will simply hurt us. We need tribunals that we insist are based on the rule of law that protects everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623911">I also would ask the member about confidence in the World Bank. Right now we have a situation where the World Bank is a dumping ground for failed neo-con hacks. We have Paul Wolfowitz who was the guy who basically helped initiate a war based on a lie. He was so bad he was run out of Washington. Now he is at the World Bank with his girlfriend. We are supposed to say that all the developing states in the third world should trust Paul Wolfowitz. We are supposed to tell everyone not to worry because he will look out for everyone's best interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623912">Now we are seeing South Americans saying, “Whoa, we've had a whole series of failed policies through the World Bank but we certainly do not have confidence in Paul the wolf”.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623917">Mr. Speaker, I will be speaking against implementing this International Centre for Settlement of International Investment Disputes and I will tell the House why.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623918">A recently released report entitled, “Challenging Corporate Investor Rule”, shows that nearly 70% of cases brought to the investment dispute centre, an institution of the World Bank group by the way, settled in favour of the investor, with compensation being awarded against the country where the investment failed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623919">The report notes that in 7 out of 109 cases filed with ICSID, the investor's revenues exceeded the gross domestic product of the country they were suing. The case I will be describing may add to the number of these cases. These developing countries must pay fines that far exceed the gross domestic product.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623920">The Center for International Environmental Law says that the arbitration raises a number of problems. I will describe to the House what is currently one of the big cases in front of this settlement dispute centre.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623921">The U.K. based British investor, Biwater Gauff, is demanding $25 million from the Government of Tanzania after the latter terminated its contract with City Water Services in 2005, allegedly because the company had failed to provide clean drinking water to millions of people in Dar es Salaam. Paying $25 million to this British company is a tremendous amount of money for a very poor country like Tanzania. Biwater's 10 year contract to provide water service in this city was terminated by the Tanzanian government in 2005, only two years after it began operations in 2003. Why was that the case? It is because the Tanzanian government said that the company had not been able to provide clean water as it was supposed to for its citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623922">Normally one would think that engaging a private operator for running water service commercially is a radical departure from the free service tradition in place in that country since 1991. Why did Tanzania privatize its drinking water? It was one of the conditions imposed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in order for Tanzania to qualify for debt relief under the heavily indebted poor countries initiative. Similarly, the World Bank's 2000 country assistance strategy made the signing of a concession agreement assigning the assets of this place to a private management company one of the conditions Tanzania had to meet in order to qualify for enhanced annual loans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623923">How did these heavily indebted poor countries get indebted in the first place? It was because the World Bank was lending them money with huge interest rates and they could not provide the debt repayment. It is an absurd situation where poor countries are sending more money to rich countries. The World Bank is telling them that in order for it to lend them even more money they must privatize their water. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623924">This U.K. based British investor Biwater then goes in and privatizes their water. It tells the poor folks in Tanzania that it will deliver clean water but it did not do so after two years of operation. The government rightly said that it would not continue with the contract but the company took the dispute to the international centre. Seventy per cent of these cases end up in favour of the investors. It is biased against a lot of these poor developing countries.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="623925">Another organization, the Center for International Environmental Law, says that the arbitration case I am talking about raises a number of issues of vital concern to the local community in Tanzania, as well as for other developing countries that have privatized or are contemplating a possible privatization of water and other essential infrastructure services. Another organization, Public Services International, says that this dispute shows how problematic it is to include investment rules in trade investment agreements, particularly if they include investor-state provisions which allow the investor to sue host governments at international tribunals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623926">One of the problems with this dispute settlement mechanism is that the public has no way of knowing how the decisions are taken. The decision is not transparent. It is not clear how much the government is expected to pay if the government ends up losing. As a result, the public cannot hold a government or foreign corporate entities to account, or judge the legitimacy of the decisions. This erodes democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623927">Furthermore, because the decision is made in a body that will not be disclosed to the public, it has far reaching effects. It would seriously erode the sovereign authority of the Canadian state, and Canadians would have no say in the course of proceedings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623928">Instead of rushing in without any discussion with our public environmental groups and all the other NGOs, we should look at this situation very carefully. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623929">In the case of Tanzania, what we have now is the Center for International Environmental Law from Switzerland, the Lawyers' Environmental Action Team, the Legal and Human Rights Centre, and the International Institute for Sustainable Development filing support letters and helping Tanzania in defending its case before the dispute settlement centre.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623930">Instead of rushing in, we should ensure there is better international investment, which can bring substantial benefits to developing countries. We need to develop a comprehensive regulatory framework that actively promotes sustainable development and ensures that environmental limits are preserved. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623931">We need to create the right regulatory framework for sustainable investment. It would require action at the regional, national and international levels.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623932">We need frameworks that would provide host countries with the flexibility and ability to control investment flows that undermine their sustainable development targets as developed through transparent and consultative processes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623933">At the international level, there needs to be cooperation between states in consultation with civil society to ensure that existing and future bilateral or regional investment treaties allow host countries to set minimum environmental standards and prohibit the lowering of environmental standards to attract investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623934">We need to make sure that legal barriers to suing foreign investors and forcing judgment in home countries are removed. We need to make sure detailed binding regulations are developed in environmentally sensitive industries, for example, in the chemicals and minerals industries, and that restrictive business practices such as transfer pricing, investment incentives, and bribery and corruption are addressed.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="623935">The host or recipient countries, supported by development assistance and in consultation with civil society, should strengthen their environmental and economic governance structures to support sustainable investment. That means taking measures to integrate environmental objectives into key sectoral policies such as energy, transport and agriculture and develop integrated policy packages that balance investors' rights with public needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623936">Measures are needed to ensure foreign investors and domestic companies disclose any environmental and social impacts. We should also make sure that investment related activities are fully covered by environmental laws and policies including the polluter pays principle. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623937">Home or investing countries should create mechanisms to lever additional funds from investors for projects aimed at sustainable development. Assistance to investors should be conditional on good environmental performance, for example, through export credit agencies. Development assistance that supports recipient country efforts to develop good environmental and social governance should be provided. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623938">There also should be a mandatory code of conduct for companies to prevent those following environmental best practice from being undermined by unscrupulous competitors. At a minimum, companies must adhere to the existing OECD guidelines for multinational corporations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623939">Taken together, these measures and others should ensure that a proper balance is struck between protecting the rights of investors and promoting public goods. Once these measures are in place, perhaps Canada would be in a position to discuss the implementation of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States. If we do not have that, we would be prematurely rushing in a World Bank mechanism that is now hurting a lot of developing countries.</ParaText>

He can go to an international dispute mechanism and say, “Give me all the money. I own everything. I am not disclosing anything because I hide behind an Ontario numbered company and the citizens of Toronto will pay for that”. The citizens of Canada who are being hit for this $350 million right now have no ability through this dispute mechanism to challenge Vito G. Gallo, whoever he is, wherever he is--</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623957">Mr. Speaker, I had no intention of entering this debate; however, the member opposite is taking shots at chapter 11 of NAFTA, as my colleague from across the way raised.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623958">Chapter 11 extends the right of Canadian companies the same legal powers that existed for foreign companies to sue the Canadian government for changing laws under unfair treatment and it extends that principle of equal treatment for Canadian companies operating in other countries. What chapter 11 does is it empowers Canada, it empowers Canadian companies, so that we can do business abroad and be treated equally with companies in those domestic nations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623959">Chapter 11 has been a huge benefit to Canada, has extended free trade, has created tens of thousands of jobs. How in the world can she get up in her place, in full sobriety, and actually argue against chapter 11? My God.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="623960">Mr. Speaker, tell every forestry worker who has been laid off in the last few years that chapter 11 of NAFTA is doing a marvellous job for them. Tell them that. Tell them it has certainly empowered the Canadian government and all the lumber companies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623961">Guess what? About $1 billion of Canadian money was left. Even though we won, so what? We gave up that right. It does not matter whether we win or not because we have a government that will actually reward the bullies who are completely ignoring trade agreements, even though we win. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623962">Yet, over and over again, and we just saw the softwood lumber sellout, we said we will back-off and we left $1 billion on the table. Think of what $1 billion could do for those hard-working families in northern Ontario and Quebec who are losing their jobs because of this softwood sellout.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="78950" Type="18">Mr. James Moore (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Works and Government Services and Minister for the Pacific Gateway and the Vancouver-Whistler Olympics, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="623977">Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Conservative federal government, I am proud to rise in this House to begin second reading debate on Bill <Document DbId="2754603" Type="3">C-47</Document>, the Olympic and Paralympic marks act. The bill is part of the Government of Canada's effort to support the upcoming 2010 Winter and Paralympic Games. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623978">The games, a great honour for British Columbians, are a massive endeavour that will bring the world to Vancouver, a sense of pride to every Canadian and, hopefully, championship glory to our athletes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623979">As reflected in the short title of this bill, the Olympic and Paralympic marks act, its purpose is relatively straightforward. The government is proposing this legislation for two main reasons: first, to follow through on a commitment made by the International Olympic Committee during the bid phase of the 2010 games to adequately protect the Olympic and Paralympic brand if the games were awarded to Vancouver; and second, to assist the Vancouver organizing committee, VANOC, to maximize private sector participation in the games that will be critical to the success and legacy of the Vancouver 2010 games.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623980">To open the debate on Bill <Document DbId="2754603" Type="3">C-47</Document>, I would like to offer a brief explanation of how the bill will help provide a legal framework for the marketing of the games and compare that to the legislative approach taken in other countries that have hosted or will be hosting future games.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623981">In 2010 Vancouver-Whistler will become home to 6,000 athletes and officials from more than 80 countries. An army of more than 20,000 employees and volunteers will help make the games run smoothly. The competition will be covered by 10,000 members of the media and witnessed by more than three billion people worldwide. Simply put, the Olympic Games are the world's largest sporting event. This is part of the reason why our government is so proud to be an active partner. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623982">Our government knows that these games are about commitment whether as an athlete or as an organizing committee. Our financial commitment extends to provincial services essential for an event of this magnitude, such as security, health and immigration, as well as border and meteorological services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623983"> Our commitment will include a legacy endowment fund that will provide operational funding for the 2010 games sporting venues and fund high-performance amateur sporting programs across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623984">However, direct financial contribution is only part of the support that we can provide. We must also ensure that our intellectual property framework is not only up to international standards but will also foster maximum participation of the private sector in the games.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623985">Since the 1988 Calgary Olympic Games, corporate partnerships have become a significant source of revenue for events of all kinds, from the local hockey tournaments to international sporting events. Businesses sign on as partners with particular events because the objectives that the events are in line with happen to be in line with their own. Corporate partnerships work because the value of the association enhances their corporate brands.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623986">The Olympics are no doubt the best known sporting event in the world. Billions of people watch them on television and follow the events on the radio, in the newspapers and on line. As a result, the Olympic symbols, such as the five rings, are among the best known around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623987">The passionate global audience that is attracted to the Olympics, and increasingly to the Paralympic Games are of obvious interest to companies wanting to connect to that audience.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623988">In response to this increased corporate attention, the Olympic movement has developed a sophisticated approach for working with those companies. The IOC, the International Olympic Committee, and the national bodies, such as the Canadian Olympic Committee, work closely with companies and organizations that want to become partners of the games or our national teams. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623989">They work closely with companies and organizations that are interested in using Olympic or national team symbols of various kinds in their marketing and communications. Companies can compete and become official partners in specific product categories or the entire Olympic moment for a national Olympic body and for specific games. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623990">Companies compete to receive licences that allow them to use the Olympic symbols and terms on products. They compete for the right to produce items with Olympic themes from something as simple as a souvenir T-shirt to a marketing campaign focused around the entire product line. These partnerships are now a critical part of the business plan for the event. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623991">For the 2010 Olympic Games, VANOC has projected that it will receive 40% of its operational funding from games-related partnerships and licensing agreements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623992">In 2006 alone, VANOC announced that it had signed partnership agreements worth $115 million. However, corporate partnerships and licensing agreements depend on the ability of the games organizers to ensure that the Olympic partners and licensees have the unique rights that they competed for and should therefore expect. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623993">Why does this matter? Let me use the example of the T-shirt that I just suggested a minute ago. If I operate a T-shirt company, I can compete for a licence with VANOC to sell T-shirts that have the official Vancouver-Whistler 2010 Olympics symbol on it. When I pay for that licence, I am paying for an exclusive right to produce those 2010 games T-shirts, but if others are able to use those same symbols or ones that are likely to be seen as essentially the same, what business reason do I have to compete for the licence in the first place? </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="623994">We need a legal framework with clear rules on the use of Olympic symbols and associated words. We need sound, prompt and effective remedies that will deter free riders who seek to cash in on the Olympics to the detriment of the games or the official partners. Put simply, we need to protect the commitment of our partners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623995">That brings me today to Bill <Document DbId="2754603" Type="3">C-47</Document>. Canada has a strong intellectual property rights protection regime in place today. For example, the current Trade Marks Act provides a certain degree of protection for Olympics related marks and symbols. Under section 9 of that act, by virtue of their status as public authorities, the Canadian Olympic Committee and VANOC enjoy a certain degree of protection for various Olympic related marks. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623996">However, in light of the upcoming 2010 Winter Games and changes in the marketplace since the Trade Marks Act was written, the protection of Olympic and Paralympic marks is of sufficient importance as to merit a dedicated stand-alone piece of legislation in addition. There are reasons for this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623997">The first reason is the significant expense required to host Olympic and Paralympic games, to build the world-class sporting facilities and infrastructure needed and, as I have mentioned, an increasing reliance on the private sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623998">The second such reason stems from the concern that current laws are insufficient to prevent non-partner companies from using their own trade marks in a manner that misleads or is likely to mislead the public into thinking that they have some business relationship with the games. We need the legal frameworks in place to deal with what are referred to as ambush marketers. We need legislation to address the free riders who jump on the Olympic bandwagon at the last minute for a quick buck.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="623999">Finally, there is the concern that current remedies under common law are insufficient to prevent suspected trademark infringers and ambush marketers from continuing their offending behaviour during the limited timelines involved. What is needed are fast but responsible remedies as the games may be over by the time a court ruling brings a case to a close and brings a decision to a given case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624000">What no one wants are Olympic organizers potentially spending more time and money on litigation to protect their brand than they do on organizing the actual games. As the bulk of the brand policing would take place at a time when Canadians would prefer that VANOC, the Canadian Olympic organizing committee, and the IOC focus on delivering the best Winter Olympics and Paralympics ever. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624001">That is why in 2002 the Government of Canada committed to the IOC to provide necessary legal measures in line with what is asked of Olympic host nations to protect the Olympic symbols, emblems, logos, marks, and many other Olympic related marks and designations. That brings us to why we are here today. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="624054">moved that Bill <Document DbId="2432417" Type="4">C-426, An Act to amend the Canada Evidence Act (protection of journalistic sources and search warrants)</Document>, be read the second time and referred to a committee. </ParaText>
              <ProceduralText TocType="TPC" id="24">Bill C-426. Second reading</ProceduralText>
              <ParaText id="624055">He said: Mr. Speaker, it must be quite something for individual members to have to select the topic of their private members' bills. Mine has to do with a concern I have ever since the late 1960s. As a young lawyer at the time, I witnessed the birth of the Quebec Federation of Professional Journalists. I had friends who were journalists and I was called upon, as a lawyer, to sort out many problems between journalists and the police.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624056">At that time, we came to the conclusion that it would be great if there were legislation. Since then, we have had section 2(<I>b</I>) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantee the freedom of the press and other media of communication. In addition, the case law has evolved toward providing some protection. I think that the bill I have introduced is fitting a lot of case law in just two and a half pages. The sad reality is that the problem is still a current one. It happens all the time. It may not be as newsworthy as other items, but unfortunately there is still a problem. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624057"> The first broad principle we must understand is that this is not a question of giving journalists privileges; it is a question of protecting a journalistic activity that is for the common good and that enables people who are witnesses to breaches of trust or great injustices to direct investigative journalists toward sources of information or evidence of breaches of trust. The journalists will then write their articles based on that information. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624058"> The bill is also an attempt to protect another broad principle: that journalists must not be perceived as auxiliary police. In too many criminal cases, there have been attempts to use information that journalists have gathered, with harmful effects, because then demonstrators, for example, attack the journalists. In fact, several camera operators have had rocks thrown at them at demonstrations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624059"> While the content of the bill is very brief, it addresses four major subjects. First, there is protection of journalistic sources. Sources request confidentiality because, if they are revealed, they could suffer reprisals, sometimes actual physical reprisals, and often economic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624060"> Second, it establishes the principle that use of material that journalists have gathered but not published will be the exception. This involves various cases where confidentiality has been requested, but it is still important for journalists not to be perceived as auxiliary police. As well, it provides for search warrants to be issued in exceptional cases, and we will see the requirements that must be met. It also provides for how the search is to be conducted, once it has been begun. And I also decided to solve one small problem by offering a way in which publication can be easily proved. A publication has been published, and it seems to me that it can be proved by producing it in evidence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624061"> As well, it obviously provides for the necessary exceptions: first, to prevent easy defamation through bad influence by a malicious source, and second, to reconcile these principles with the state’s interest so that an investigation can be carried out and crimes punished. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624062"> This bill is therefore based on the importance of freedom of information in a democratic society. Because this is a value of a democratic society, and not a privilege, we will also see that it provides that the judge may raise the question on his or her own initiative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624063">First, the bill uses the definition of the word “record” found in the Access to Information Act, because it is the broadest definition found in our legislation and it is also used in numerous other laws. The bill also relates to the Canada Evidence Act. Obviously, we are legislating only in relation to federal matters and this bill applies to federal matters. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624064">Then it defines the word “journalist”. The definition is broad, but also contains restrictions, as we will see. A journalist is a person who contributes regularly and directly to the gathering, writing, production or dissemination of information for the public through any media, or anyone who assists such a person.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="30">(1830)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="624065">Thus, we cannot act as a journalist one day and spread slander. No, it would have to be a regular contribution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624066">The definition of media is broad. It includes blogs, with the exception of occasional blogs, and includes those written for the public on a regular basis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624067">Subsection 3 establishes the principle that a journalist has the right to refuse to disclose a confidential source. As I said earlier, this is a principle of public interest and not a privilege given to journalists. If judges notice a problem of that nature, they can raise the issue themselves. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624068">Subsection 5 talks about the inevitable exception. However, it is very limited and intended to protect public interest. Thus, a judge “may not order a journalist to disclose to a person the source of any information that the journalist has gathered, written, produced or disseminated for the public through any media, unless the judge considers that:”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624069"> First of all, the person who is requesting the disclosure has done everything in the person’s power to discover the source of the information through other means. The disclosure is in the public interest, and the judge must consider three principles: the outcome of the litigation, and therefore the importance of this case for the outcome of the litigation; the freedom of information, and thus the impact it could have on how easy it is for journalists to obtain information; and the impact of the journalist’s testimony on the source.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624070">All of these provisions were based on current case law. The burden of proof falls to whoever requests the disclosure. They must prove that the disclosure is necessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624071">Let us now move on to subsection 7. We are not talking about records with a confidential source, but notes that journalists have decided not to publish. This is done simply to establish the principle that journalists must not be seen as working on behalf of the state. If they decide to not publish something, then before searching for their personal notes, we must ensure that it is really necessary to do so and that other means have been attempted to obtain them. Television cameras are not police cameras and must not be perceived as such. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624072">A judge must meet very strict conditions for issuing a warrant. When we read them, we realize the importance of these conditions. What is quite important, among other things, is that there must be a supporting affidavit enabling the judge to properly consider all the circumstances in order to determine if the applicable conditions are met. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624073">Obviously, the judge must provide the conditions for the search to ensure that the media are not unduly prevented from publishing the information. The search must not interfere with their work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624074">Once the warrant is provided, the way in which the search is to be conducted is indicated. It must not be unreasonably conducted. Once again, I refer to jurisprudence. Given that a decision will have to be made on whether the information is public or secret, every document must be sealed immediately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624075">I have added something that I believe may be useful, that before sealing documents, the police involved in a search must obtain information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624076">To fully respect the principle that documents must not be disclosed before a judge has ruled to that effect, I establish this principle, namely that anyone who participates in seizing a document must keep its contents confidential, unless otherwise instructed by the judge at a later date.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624077">Finally, the fourth part is to ensure, since we are amending the Canada Evidence Act to make it easier to produce a publication in evidence, that it is not necessary to summons the editor in chief or anyone else at the newspaper. If it is published, it is published and one only has to produce it. That is established by subsection 11.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624078">The bill is a distillation but what purpose does it serve?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="624079">That is what I was told by one of the experts I consulted. Instead of citing 1,000 or 2,000 pages of jurisprudence, instead of identifying majority and minority judges and so on, this piece of legislation—which respects the principles of jurisprudence—is only two and a half pages long. That makes it a very useful, practical tool. It is useful to police officers because it tells them the requirements that must be met before seeking a search warrant. It also helps them execute search warrants. All of these rules exist in the many long pages of the jurisprudence. The bill will also be useful to justices of the peace who issue search warrants. Before publishing search warrants, justices will consult this short piece of legislation and know exactly what to do. It will also be useful to the media and journalists who can read it to find out how they are protected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624080">It should be noted that this is just a federal law. Therefore, it does not apply to civil matters. It does, however, cover police relations. In the past, this is what caused the most problems. I am sure that it will also influence civil law because it is inspired by paragraph 2(<I>b</I>) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which also applies to civil legislation. It therefore affects civil law. Given that the principles underlying this act summarize the jurisprudence related to paragraph 2(<I>b</I>), judges in the civil law system will certainly look to it for inspiration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624081">Once again, it is important to understand that this is not a privilege for journalists. This does not release them from their civil obligation to not engage in gratuitous defamation. Journalists will have to use independently gathered evidence to decide whether to expose and disseminate what they have learned. The source must remain anonymous to avoid reprisals. In so doing, the paper or other medium the journalist works for that publishes findings assumes full civil responsibility for any damage resulting from false or defamatory information. To comply with their civil obligations, the media must be able to present a defence based on public interest and truth. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624082">I had a lot of help drafting this bill. First, I was inspired by current jurisprudence on this issue, which I deal with as a hobby. In fact, I practised criminal law, but I have been interested in this issue since the end of the 1960s. I also relied on the work of the Fédération professionnelle des journalistes du Québec, including a remarkable study by Marie-Claude Pednault. I was also inspired by the memorandum of understanding in Quebec between the justice department, the bar and the Fédération professionnelle des journalistes du Québec. I consulted legislation in Belgium, France, Sweden and a number of other countries. I read jurisprudence in the European Court of Human Rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624083">This bill is short, but, for those who are going to read it, it is dense. It was not scribbled down quickly on a napkin. I also consulted a number of expert lawyers and information law professors. I think this piece of legislation fills a need and it will be useful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624084">By the way, the United States has 32 laws on this very mater. This bill is consistent with the line of thinking in democratic countries that recognize the fact that in the society we live in, it is in the public's interest for some people with information about corruption or gross injustices to be able to turn to journalists and direct them in their investigations. Then, when there are legal debates and the crux of the debate is not on the defence of the corruption for which there is evidence, but on the knowledge of who provided the information, the judge will be able to refuse in order to protect the source.</ParaText>

The gathering of information could in many circumstances be seriously inhibited, if government had too ready access to information in the hands of the media. The press should not be turned into an investigative arm of the police. Thus, the fear that the police can easily gain access to a reporter's notes could well hamper the ability of the press to gather information. </QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="624089">My question has to do with the definition of journalist. I would like to know if a definition already exists in any legislation in Canada, either federally or provincially, or if there is any case law that establishes the definition of a journalist.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624090">I must admit, although I am in favour of this bill—and I intend to recommend that my caucus support it and refer it to committee—we have some concerns nonetheless. The definition of journalist, as written in the bill, is rather broad and could even include the distributor or printer of a document produced by a journalist.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="624092"> Mr. Speaker, that is a very good question that deserves a good answer and I will be quick to provide it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624093">There are several definitions for the term “journalist”. That was the most succinct one that I found. However, there is also an extremely important fact to be considered when we state: “anyone who assists such a person”. The idea is that if someone cannot obtain the information from the journalist, they may turn to the printer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624094">It is very important to protect the individuals who work with the journalist and who, through their jobs, as humble as they may be, may have knowledge of a secret source. These individuals may have seen, for example, notes on the journalist's desk or have information required for printing the newspaper. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624095">Rather than considering each individual case—and I must admit that sometimes we found some expressions to be somewhat ridiculous—we opted for the expression, “anyone who assists such a person”. By accepting the rules of interpretation, namely that the words must always serve the obvious purpose of the law, this purpose must be to protect the source that could suffer retaliation if their name were to be disclosed, even by the housekeeper. In fact, the latter could have learned certain things by listening to a conversation between two people at some point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624096">Thus, we speak of any individual who works with the business and who would have access to these names. I believe that is how the courts would interpret it. That is why we decided to use this very simple expression which, when interpreted thus, is clear in concrete cases.</ParaText>

I will speak directly to the bill later, but my first question is with regard to the blogosphere. The hon. member mentioned the not occasional bloggers and then referred to proposed subsection 39.1(1) that provides the definition of “journalist”, stating: </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="624100">Mr. Speaker, perhaps I was a little hasty in using the word “blog”. Basically, in the definition, I was trying to anticipate the world in which we will probably live and in which there will be electronic journals. Furthermore, I sought the advice of computer experts on this. And it has already begun. There are people who keep blogs on a regular basis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624101">We believe that by applying the spirit of this definition to people who write, film or record, the expression of a person “who contributes regularly and directly to the gathering, writing, production or dissemination of information ...” is broad enough to include people who keep electronic journals or who already have real journals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624102">However, this will not apply to anyone who decides one day to start a blog, seek out their source and begin to slander. No—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="624104">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in the House and speak to Bill <Document DbId="2432417" Type="4">C-426</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624105">I doubt that there is any Canadian who would argue with the statement that freedom of speech and freedom of the press are not two cornerstones of a free and democratic society. I think all would agree with the statement that they are imperative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624106">In fact, subsection 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms provides a specific constitutional right to “freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624107">In consideration of Bill <Document DbId="2432417" Type="4">C-426</Document>, I think that it is important to first summarize the main components of the bill and then determine whether they are an improvement on the current law that we have in the country today. In other words, are there limitations in the current law that threaten freedom of the press and if so, do the provisions that Bill C-426 brings forward address these gaps? If no such limitation exists, then Bill <Document DbId="2432417" Type="4">C-426</Document> may be unnecessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624108">I would like to begin with a summary of the primary components of Bill <Document DbId="2432417" Type="4">C-426</Document>. The bill has three main components. The first is a statutory protection that prohibits a journalist from being compelled to disclose the source of information supplied to the journalist. Although not totally clear in the bill, this appears to be a protection from testimonial compulsion when the journalist becomes a witness in a case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624109">This protection, however, is not absolute. It is subject to a more general provision that expressly prohibits a judge from making an order forcing the journalist to disclose an information source unless the judge is satisfied that certain tests are met. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624110">The difficulty with the two sections being in the same provision is that the first section addresses the journalist as a witness and the second section is all encompassing. It does not matter whether the journalist is a witness or not. This means that it is not clear which section applies and in which circumstance it applies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624111">A second component of Bill <Document DbId="2432417" Type="4">C-426</Document> protects a journalist from having to disclose unpublished information only if the material is of “vital importance” and it cannot be produced in evidence by any other means.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624112">The problem with the bill is that vital importance is not defined. What do we mean by vital importance? Also, the section refers to unpublished information that is produced as evidence. What if the information that is brought forward does not become evidence in the case? Is it still protected? This provision in this bill does not make that clear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624113">The final component of the bill creates restrictions on the ability of a judge to issue a search warrant to seize information in the possession of the journalist. The reference to a judge is curious in view of the fact that search warrants are usually issued by a justice, defined in the Criminal Code to be a justice of the peace or a provincial court judge. It is not clear whether the reference to a judge is intended to remove this discretion from what the Criminal Code lists as being a justice of the peace or a court judge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624114">The issuance of search warrants by judicial officers, usually justices, has been considered by the courts. The Supreme Court of Canada has expressively stated:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624115">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The privacy interests of individuals in a democratic society must be carefully weighed in a search warrant application against the interests of the state in investigating and prosecuting crimes.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624116">The Supreme Court has also stated that even if the statutory requirements for issuing a search warrant have been met, where the premises to be searched are those of the media, the justice must exercise his or her discretion to determine whether a warrant is actually necessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624117">Where a warrant is justified, the courts have directed that the justice must consider the conditions that may be attached to the warrant to ensure that any disruption of the gathering and dissemination of the news is limited as much as possible.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="50">(1850)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="624118">The Supreme Court of Canada has clearly said that a number of factors should be taken into consideration when a justice is exercising his or her discretion to issue a search warrant to seize documents in the possession of the press. The weight given to the various factors varies depending on the facts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624119">The courts have recognized that where the police seek to obtain a search warrant to retrieve materials in the possession of a journalist that carry a high expectation of privacy, for example, handwritten notes or information jotted down in a scribbler, the justice exercising his or her discretion as to whether to issue the warrant should consider factors that may not be relevant in other circumstances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624120">One such factor is whether reasonable efforts have been made by the police to obtain the information from other sources. The courts have recognized that a fear that the police can easily gain access to a reporter's notes could hamper the ability of the press to gather that information, to hold onto that information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624121">There are many examples to illustrate the fact that there is no one size fits all approach to determining whether a search warrant should be issued in particular circumstances involving the press, and if so, what conditions should be attached to the warrant. Each case is considered having regard to the particular facts before the judge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624122">I suggest that this case by case approach is a very effective way to ensure that an appropriate balance is struck between freedom of the press and the state interest in investigating and prosecuting crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624123">In contrast to this approach, Bill <Document DbId="2432417" Type="4">C-426</Document> sets out a set of mandatory statutory requirements that must be met in each and every case before a search warrant can be issued. In my view, there is a risk that this makes the law too rigid. I also think that there are two other serious problems with Bill C-426: first, is the very broad definition of a journalist; and second, is the absence of a definition or qualification on what type of information is protected by the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624124">In the bill, a journalist is defined as:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624125">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentRest="2" IndentFirst="2">--a person who contributes regularly and directly to the gathering, writing, production or dissemination of information for the public through any media, or anyone who assists such a person.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624126">The concern that I have with this definition is that it is so broad, it captures persons it was not clearly intended to include. Even my Liberal colleague from across the way questioned who then would be qualified, who would be listed as a journalist, so I think this particular aspect of the bill is a concern to all parties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624127">For example, the definition applies not only to persons engaged in journalistic activities, but also to teenagers who are daily bloggers on the Internet. They could be listed as journalists in those cases. The technician at the television station who repairs the computers used by journalists also technically falls within the definition of a journalist. I cannot imagine that the intent of Bill <Document DbId="2432417" Type="4">C-426</Document> was to extend statutory protection to the activities of these individuals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624128">A further problem is that the bill does not define or qualify what kind of information in the possession of a journalist attracts the protection of the search warrant provision. The section is cast so broadly that it could include information that has absolutely nothing to do with the journalist's activity, for example, phone bills or other things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624129">The section also does not distinguish between information that journalists collect during their work and information relevant to a criminal investigation involving the journalist as a target. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624130">In conclusion, I submit that it is not clear at all that there are any limitations in the current law that need to be addressed. I think the current law does a very good job of achieving the delicate balance between freedom of the press and the state interest in the investigation of the crime. The current law takes a principled approach that is sufficiently flexible to address a wide variety of fact situations.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="55">(1855)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="624131">I am also concerned that there are some serious problems with many of the provisions in Bill <Document DbId="2432417" Type="4">C-426</Document>. A number of these problems are sufficiently serious that, not only would they not achieve the policy objective of the bill, but they would create considerable uncertainty about the state of the law. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624132">I am pleased to have had the opportunity today to bring forward in this place some of the concerns we have with this private members' bill. I want to thank the official opposition for addressing some of those concerns in their questions.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="624133">Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned earlier when I addressed my question to my colleague from the Bloc, the member for the riding of <Affiliation DbId="78405" Type="2">Marc-Aurèle-Fortin</Affiliation>, I am very happy to speak in favour of his bill. I will be brief. Perhaps not as brief as you would like, but I will try. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624134"> Bill <Document DbId="2432417" Type="4">C-426</Document>, as the member for <Affiliation DbId="78405" Type="2">Marc-Aurèle-Fortin</Affiliation> mentioned seeks to amend the Canada Evidence Act to protect the confidentiality of journalistic sources and the freedom of the press. It would also add a new clause to the Canada Evidence Act that would allow journalists who appear before a court to refuse to disclose information or a record that has not been published unless it is of vital importance and cannot be produced in evidence by any other means. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624135"> In addition, the new clause establishes specific conditions that must be met for a judge to issue a search warrant to obtain information or records that a journalist possesses. The bill stipulates the manner in which a search must be conducted. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624136"> Bill <Document DbId="2432417" Type="4">C-426</Document> also allows journalists to refuse to disclose the source of the information that they gather, write, produce or disseminate to the public through any media, and to refuse to disclose any information or document that could identify a source. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624137"> Under the bill, a judge could only order a journalist to disclose the source of the information if the judge considers it to be in the public interest, having regard to the outcome of the litigation, the freedom of information and the impact of the journalist’s testimony on the source. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624138"> At present, as the member for <Affiliation DbId="78405" Type="2">Marc-Aurèle-Fortin</Affiliation> stated, journalistic freedom is protected by provision 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which guarantees freedom of expression, including freedom of the press. However, there is no legislative measure in Canada that allows a journalist to refuse to disclose a source. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624139"> Many lower courts in the country have adopted diverging points of view on this question. They generally rule that even though disclosure of a journalistic source could harm the parties concerned, it is often more important to disclose the information before a court. They generally hesitate to compel journalists to reveal information obtained from a source on a confidential basis. Canadian courts follow the precedence established by the decision rendered by a court in Great Britain in the case of the Attorney General vs Mulholland, which states that journalists should not be required to disclose information provided by a source on a confidential basis unless the petitioner can show that the information is relevant and necessary to the conclusion of a case. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624140">As I said in my question for the member for <Affiliation DbId="78405" Type="2">Marc-Aurèle-Fortin</Affiliation>, the definition of “journalist” seems pretty broad to me. He suggested a few ways to resolve this, and I am looking forward to discussing this in committee. In fact, that is why I plan to vote in favour of this bill at second reading and why I am recommending that my Liberal colleagues support this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624141">I would like to raise a few points concerning weaknesses in some parts of the English version of the text. I simply wish to clarify this in the hope that, with the support of other members, my colleague will allow some amendments to be made in committee. Paragraph 39.1(7) reads as follows:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="624143">The English version of the bill refers to “vital importance”, while the French version refers to “importance déterminante”.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="624144">I should point out that the French version of the text provides a much more concise definition of the conditions required for such disclosure. For example, the word “déterminante” refers, I suppose, to the determination of the case, whereas in English, “vital importance” is very vague and much broader. Therefore, I think we need to find another English expression that makes the English version as clear as the French one.<I /></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624145">Next, in the introductory paragraph to paragraph 39.1(8), the English text is poorly written.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="05">(1905)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="624146"> It would make the subsection much clearer if the term “if” was replaced by “unless”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624147">The English text also refers to a search that is “unreasonably conducted”. This is a very broad term that has no precise meaning. I have been unable to find any kind of definition that is provided through jurisprudence on this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624148">Whereas the French version of the bill which refers to “effectuée de façon abusive” is much clearer and there is an abundance of jurisprudence that actually defines what an abusive search would be. We could be using our legislative drafters and experts in committee in order to tighten up the English text.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624149">Subsection 39.1(9) states: “Any record seized...shall be sealed right away and opened only before a judge who shall determine the manner in which the record is to be kept and disclosed.”. In this subsection the English “right away” should be changed or replaced by the term “immediately”. “Right away” is not a term that we would use in legislation. Those are just a couple of examples. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624150">One of the cases obviously that raised this as an issue with the member for <Affiliation DbId="78405" Type="2">Marc-Aurèle-Fortin</Affiliation> was the O'Neill v. Canada which made a lot of headlines and received a lot of attention. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624151">As the member knows, it was challenged constitutionally and section 4 of the Security of Information Act was struck down through a court decision, but the act has yet to be amended. Therefore, I would suggest that the member may wish to agree to an amendment which would go beyond the scope of his bill that would include amendments to the Security of Information Act. Given that it is his bill, he could accept the amendment or not. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624152">In the case of O'Neill vs. Canada, the Ontario Superior Court judge struck down paragraph 4(1)(a), subsection 4(3), and paragraph 4(4)(b) of the Security of Information Act as violations of section 7: the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice and subsection 2(b). </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624153">Justice Ratushny held that these subsections were over-broad, arbitrary, and vague and gave the government an unfettered ability to protect whatever information it chose to classify as unauthorized for disclosure and to punish any violation by way of a criminal offence. Therefore, the relevant subsections were declared of no force and effect.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="624156">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to join in the debate. I want to thank the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78405" Type="2">Marc-Aurèle-Fortin</Affiliation> for bringing this forward. At the end of the day it would be nice to see unanimous support for this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624157">Quite frankly, this should be seen as complex, yes, but controversial, no. The issue should be motherhood in terms of whether we believe as a nation that we have laws that will protect the freedom of the press and, in this case, the specific part of it that relates to releasing confidential information, information that a reporter, during the course of his or her duties, has given such commitment and whether the law and the courts would have the right to force a reporter to divulge it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624158">We have had a couple of very clear examples in Canada. One of them happened in my own home town of Hamilton. All members and many people watching would be familiar with the reporter from the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I>, Juliet O'Neill. I believe the case has already been mentioned during the debates and we know what happened. We now have the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624159">When we look back, now that we know exactly what happened, it is actually a bit of a stain on this country that this process took place. Police not only went through her office but they went to her home. I just want to make this as personal as possible because at the end of the day this person was looking at armed officers at her door carrying out the duties that the court had ordered. What it meant was that they were going through her underwear drawer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624160">Given the incredibly historic importance of the Maher Arar case, where was Canada? Where was our Charter of Rights? Where were the words that sound good about protection and the individual rights and freedoms that Canadians have under the Constitution for journalists and freedom of the press? Where was all of that? The speeches do not matter much if, when the rubber hits the road, the protection is not there for individual Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624161">That is why I again want to thank my colleague, who I have known for quite some time. I said before that we had the opportunity, when we were both the respective solicitors general of our provinces, to work together on both provincial and national matters. I am not the least bit surprised that when we are talking about rights, it would be the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78405" Type="2">Marc-Aurèle-Fortin</Affiliation> who stepped up and put this important legislation forward. I honour him for that. This is very good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624162">The other case I want to mention is the one of Ken Peters who was a reporter for <I>The Hamilton Spectator</I>. I also want to say that the mover of the bill acknowledged that he was aware of this case and its significance.

It would seem to me there is ample room and opportunity for us to provide more along the line of a guaranteed protection.

              <ParaText id="624184">Mr. Speaker, before I begin, could you tell me how many minutes are left in the debate? Do I have 10 minutes?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624185">
                <B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> You have five minutes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624186">
                <B>Mrs. Carole Lavallée:</B> All right, thank you. Now that I know how much time I have, I can choose from among the notes I have prepared.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624187">First and foremost, I would like to commend my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78405" Type="2">Marc-Aurèle-Fortin</Affiliation>, on his excellent initiative. He has worked very hard on something that is essential to improving our quality of life. This bill allows journalists to refuse to disclose information or a record that has not been published unless it is of vital importance and cannot be produced in evidence by any other means.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624188">This bill is balanced. It protects sources and consequently the practice of journalism. It also takes the public interest into account. It does not create a privileged class of people—journalists—who could write or say anything with impunity. On this subject, Claude Ryan, the eminent editorialist for <I>Le Devoir</I>, once said that the threat of imprisonment meant that a journalist had to think twice before attacking someone's reputation without valid proof.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624189">This bill concerns a matter of principle: the credibility of the journalist, but also of journalism. Imagine a situation where people with valuable information did not dare to pass it on to journalists.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624190">Lawyer Marie Claude Pedneault did an excellent job for the Fédération professionnelle des journalistes du Québec, as my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78405" Type="2">Marc-Aurèle-Fortin</Affiliation> mentioned earlier. I invite anyone who is interested to read her report. I borrowed from it heavily in preparing my speech for today, not because I wanted to plagiarize her, but as a tribute to her. I essentially took factual information from her report. Hon. members will understand that any political comments I make are my own.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624191">First and foremost, Ms. Pedneault gave specific cases where the journalistic source was problematic. The most famous case in the past 30 years is obviously the Watergate case, and the best-known journalistic source in the world was called Deep Throat. Everyone knows about that case, and I do not need to say anything more about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624192"> More recently, 30 years later, there was the Valerie Plame affair in the United States. The journalist’s crime was to have refused to reveal, to the commission of inquiry looking into the Valerie Plame affair, the name of the person who told her that Ms. Plame was a CIA agent. Right now, the <I>New York Times </I>reporter, Judith Miller, is behind bars, most likely in New York State. She will have to stay there until the end of the deliberations of the grand jury responsible for the inquiry. This is not right, you will agree.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624193"> My NDP and Liberal Party colleagues have spoken of other cases. There is Juliet O'Neil of the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I>. In January 2004, 20 RCMP officers searched her home looking for documents she had quoted in her newspaper and that talked about the alleged relations between Maher Arar and some terrorist groups. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="20">(1920)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="624194"> There is also the case of Ken Peter of the<I> Hamilton Spectator</I>, of whom we have heard plenty from our NDP colleague. And in August 2004, Pierre Jobin told about the imminent transfer of mentally ill people in the Duberger area of Quebec City. Fortunately, the judge examined the situation and said that revealing the names ran the risk of irremediably affecting Pierre Jobin’s ability to get information in the future from confidential sources. As may be seen, judges sometimes choose to protect journalistic activity because the public’s interest is not directly at stake.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624195"> The trend in the U.S., however, is very worrying, because in recent years there have been more subpoenas issued to American journalists than there were in the previous 30 years. The chief reason is the fact that George Bush’s government is not very transparent and that a preferred way of publicizing an irregular situation or wrongdoing is to let a journalist know about it anonymously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624196"> The Bush administration always takes the same approach. Journalists receive a subpoena, they are forced to testify and they are forced to give the name of their source. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="624200">Mr. Speaker, in May of last year, I put several questions to the <Affiliation DbId="78745" Type="4">Minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec</Affiliation> regarding the Saint-Hubert airport.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624201">The Saint-Hubert airport has a very important development project. The runway must be lengthened and widened, and the tarmac must be improved and upgraded. Why? So that it can accommodate larger aircraft. Indeed, a nearby company, Pratt &amp; Whitney, has changed the type of aircraft it uses for its engine test flights, and these new aircraft require a runway that is 1,200 feet longer. In any case, the Saint-Hubert airport would have to undertake this work in the coming years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624202">The federal government is being asked to contribute $70 million. The <Affiliation DbId="78771" Type="4">Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="78745" Type="4">Minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec</Affiliation> told me there would be two phases. The first phase could involve a $9.5 million investment, while the second phase would be implemented the following year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624203">During oral question period, I was told that the first $9.5 million were guaranteed—I do not remember the exact terms used—and that there was no problem as far as the first phase was concerned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624204">I asked for this adjournment debate so that I could understand what exactly is happening with these two phases, which the <Affiliation DbId="78771" Type="4">Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="78745" Type="4">Minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec</Affiliation> referred to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624205">What is the status of these two phases? How far along is the work? All the ministers who are answering my questions about the Saint-Hubert airport really seem to want to help the airport. The last time we addressed this issue here during an adjournment debate, the parliamentary secretary himself said that it was a good project and that the government wanted to help, but was looking for funding.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="624207">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to respond once again to my colleague's questions and concerns regarding the St-Hubert Airport.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624208">As the <Affiliation DbId="78771" Type="4">Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities</Affiliation> noted on March 22, he met with the representatives of the city of Longueuil, the Longueuil St-Hubert Airport Development Corporation and Pratt &amp; Whitney, which presented a proposal for a runway enlargement and expansion as well as other improvements to the St-Hubert Airport.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624209">The discussions examined the various programs available from the Canadian government through the Department of Transportation. At that time, it was noted that the proposed changes to the airport did not fall under the criteria set out for the airports capital assistance program, which is in place for all Canadian airports that are under the criteria. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624210">This program assists eligible applicants in financing capital projects related to safety, asset protection and operating cost reduction. It is designed and has specific criteria to ensure safe operations of aircraft, which is so important for Canadians, that are used for regularly scheduled flights. The standard applied across Canada is to provide funding fairly and to rehabilitate only the length of runway necessary to ensure, again, safety. Safety is the utmost concern.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624211">In this context, it is currently not possible for Transport Canada to fund the entire project submitted by Pratt &amp; Whitney and the city of Longueuil under ACAP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624212">Indeed, regarding the concerns presented by the member about job loss, I draw attention to a letter to the editor from Pratt &amp; Whitney, which was published in the Montreal <I>Gazette</I> last Thursday, in response to some matters that were raised by my colleague, as well as other persons on that side of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624213">Pratt &amp; Whitney explains that as a user of the airport it was approached to support the project and consider if it could find additional investment opportunities. However, it has said, “whether it goes ahead or not, this project will have no adverse impact on Pratt &amp; Whitney's current manpower level”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624214">Therefore, there is no sense in spreading misinformation and in fact fearmongering because it wants to make very clear that, “Pratt &amp; Whitney is not asking for any government support for the Saint Hubert Airport and does not intend to do so. There will be no layoffs—in fact, we are growing”.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="624219">However, as the member knows, asking the Economic Development Agency of Canada to contribute a full one-third of its budget to this project would most certainly deprive funding to other regions of Quebec and Quebeckers.

              <ParaText id="624229">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in this debate this evening. It gives me a chance to follow up on a question I posed to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> on April 20. I asked him the question not only on my own behalf but on behalf of the forestry communities in my riding of Algoma—Manitoulin—Kapuskasing in northern Ontario. They are suffering terribly at this very difficult time. Thousands of workers have been laid off. Families are affected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624230">First of all, I asked the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> about the idea of having a national forestry summit. I think we have to get our best minds together and include our community leaders, our industry representatives and our union leaders, the stakeholders that represent a broad range of interest in the forestry sector, to see what we can do as a society and as a country to ensure the ongoing strength of our forestry sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624231">Our country was built on forestry. If it were not for forests of Canada we would not have seen some of the great ships that travelled the oceans of this world hundreds of years ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624232">As well, I asked the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> about the softwood lumber deal that his government negotiated with the U.S. shortly after the Conservatives took office in January 2006.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624233"> I would like to quote from a letter from the United Steelworkers of America, Local 1-2995, in Kapuskasing. Its president, Guy Bourgouin, began his letter of August 28 of last year with “despite this success”, and by that he means the successes that Canada had had up to that time at the various WTO and NAFTA resolution tribunals. There had been some tremendous progress recorded by the industry, Canada and the provinces before those important panels. He said:</ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">However, despite this success, Canada appears to have capitulated to U.S. demands. Under the proposed deal we are still faced with restrictions on our access to the U.S. market in the form of a tax and/or quota, we are agreeing to allowing U.S. oversight of our provincial forest policies, and we are leaving a billion dollars of illegally collected tariffs south of the border. To top it all off, there is nothing in the agreement to ensure the stability of employment in the forest sector or the ongoing viability of our forest dependent communities.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624235">I could not have said it any better myself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624236">The Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada, which has led the charge in calling for a forest industry summit, says that the summit is necessary, that funds are needed to ensure that communities affected by the tremendous downturn in the sector have a chance to diversify their economies, and that more research needs to be done. In fact, the union says the whole management of R and D related to forestry needs a new and serious injection of federal investment. The union calls upon the government to help promote stable employment in our forest dependent communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624237">The Liberal Party position before the election of 2005-06, as announced in our November program, included measures to do exactly what the unions are calling for. They were measures to help workers and their families, to help communities diversify, and to invest in R and D. In fact, at that time we also made a commitment to help advance to the companies a significant portion of the funds that were being held by the U.S.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="624241">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to respond to the question asked by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="79017" Type="2">Algoma—Manitoulin—Kapuskasing</Affiliation> concerning the softwood lumber agreement and the Canadian forest industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624242">I think at the outset it is important to remind my colleague of the wide ranging benefits of the agreement. In 2006 Canada and the United States cleared one of the most significant hurdles this industry has ever seen, the softwood lumber dispute.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624243">Key lumber producing provinces like British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec, as well as a clear majority of industry players signalled their strong support for the agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624244">Together with the provinces and industry, we worked hard to address a broad range of concerns. The final agreement bears that out. It revoked the U.S. duty orders and terminates all litigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624245">It provides at least seven years of stability. It includes a number of initiatives to make North America's lumber industry more competitive over the long term. It returned over $5 billion in duty deposit refunds to Canadian softwood lumber exporters and it safeguards the abilities of the provinces to manage their forests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624246">As I have said before, the softwood lumber agreement was, and is, the single best way forward for this industry and the hundreds of thousands of Canadians who rely on it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624247">However, while the softwood lumber agreement is good for Canada, our work certainly did not end on October 12, the day that the agreement entered into force. The enabling legislation was passed on December 14, 2006, and we are now moving forward on the business of implementation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624248">In fact, the inaugural meeting of the softwood lumber committee took place in Washington, D.C. on February 22-23 of this year. The meeting was an opportunity for representatives from Canada and the United States to begin addressing longer term policy issues of importance to Canada such as establishing a process for determining regional exemptions from export measures and possible exclusions for softwood lumber products made from logs harvested from private lands.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624249">The United States indicated prior to the meeting that it also intended to raise some questions about certain programs implemented by the Ontario and Quebec governments. As my colleague, the hon. <Affiliation DbId="78741" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation> stated, this was a very cordial first meeting with a very positive, constructive dialogue taking place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624250">As we all know, following the softwood lumber committee meeting, the United States requested consultations under the agreement on a number of provincial programs as well as federal programs and Canada's interpretation of a provision of the agreement. Consultations involve a more formal exchange of information and are designed to help resolve differences through a better understanding of the measures at issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624251">The consultations occurred in Ottawa on April 19 of this year between Canadian and American federal officials. The consultations were constructive and positive providing a useful opportunity to clarify issues and concerns identified by the United States. American officials are now reviewing the information that Canada provided and will contact us if they have any further questions or concerns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624252">Both sides have an interest in ensuring that the agreement operates smoothly. Disagreements are inevitable in administering and implementing such a complex agreement. It was for this reason that we included in the agreement various institutional provisions that allow for a full exchange of views and to facilitate the resolution of differences in points of view.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624253">We should never forget that we are one another's most important commercial partners.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="624254">Mr. Speaker, I would like to finish up a comment from my opening remarks. Had it not been for the Bloc, the NDP and the Conservatives calling an election in late November 2005, we would have had a much better arrangement for the forest sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624255">We would not have caved in to the American demands. We would not have lost the tremendous progress that had been made in the courts, and in the NAFTA and WTO panels. The industry would have had a significant portion of its U.S. duties back in its hands by way of federal advances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624256">Let me conclude by saying that I am not sure what benefits the parliamentary secretary was talking about. My communities have not seen any such benefits. In fact, we are already seeing the American industry and government officials challenging already, before we are even two years into the deal, the terms of the so-called softwood lumber agreement.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="624260"> This may sound repetitive, and I am sure members have heard it in this House before, but they had 13 years to bring forward an agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="624261"> The softwood lumber dispute had gone on for 20 years. This new government brought it to an end. This new government recognized that we were not getting anywhere with litigation. The industries were suffering. The communities were suffering. Litigation was not of benefit to either the workers in the industry or Canadian industries themselves. We put that to bed. We brought together a softwood lumber agreement that is working.</ParaText>
