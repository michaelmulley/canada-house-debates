            <Content>
              <ParaText id="226614">Mr. Speaker, when I was speaking yesterday, I was talking about how cynical, how divisive, and how doctrinaire the government has been in bringing forth wedge issues that are not based on good public policy, but politics at its worst.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226615">I talked about GST cuts at the expense of personal income taxes, which were actually raised. I talked about a baby bonus of only $100 a month instead of real child care spaces. I talked about cancellation of the historic Kelowna accord with our first nations. I talked about how the government has rejected the Kyoto protocol and not even given us any short term or medium term goals for climate change. Instead, it has given us transit passes which will not increase ridership, but will only help those who are already using public transit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226616">Let me go on. A fifth area where this cynical government has misled us in bad policy is our cities. It cancelled our programs for needed municipal infrastructure. Sixth, on agriculture, it wants to do away with the Wheat Board without even giving farmers a full voice. In terms of justice, it has a let us get tough on crime mantra, but without doing anything to the real causes of crime in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226617">The Conservatives talked about the fiscal imbalance. They ran on that program, and they were going to do something about it. We have not seen one word about what they will do about it. They ran on a program that would reduce wait times in our hospitals. It was one of their five major planks. What have we seen? Absolutely nothing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226618">In terms of charter rights, they want to set this country back into the dark ages by ignoring the charter rights of those who are most vulnerable in our society. They want to revisit the very divisive wedge issue of the rights of people who are minorities in our society and have been accorded the right to marry by the Supreme Court of Canada. They are so cynical they will not even bring in the notwithstanding clause, which is the only way to undo what the court has said is a minority right in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226619">In terms of facing the great challenges of the new emerging economies of the world, what did the Conservatives do about China and India? They cancelled our $470 million, over five years, CAN-Trade program to put more people in place in those countries to help Canadians meet the challenges and opportunities of these new emerging markets, and to help small businesses form the partnerships and the alliances that they need in order to be competitive in our new global economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226620">Last, what have the Conservatives done? We saw it lately. Who did they sock it to? Who did they cut the funds from? Seniors, adults who are illiterate, museums, and our court challenges program, which has been the basis on which many people have been able to assert their legal rights, their charter rights. They cut the Law Commission and they socked it to women's equality rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226621">This is not the type of government that Canadians want. Canadians know that good policies are good politics. They will not stand for the government and that is why the government is falling so quickly in the polls. Canadians have seen its true colours. We will not stand for this. Let us get away from the cynicism and the small mindedness of the government, and let us govern for all Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="226622">Mr. Speaker, I know there will be many questions for this boisterous young fellow, so I will be as short as I possibly can. He is up in years. He is getting up there like me, a little older. He has been around a long time. I have been in this place 13 years and I think he has probably been here longer than that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226623">Could he tell me why the wonderful Liberal government that we had in charge for 13 years could not get rid of simple things like child pornography, which is destroying our youth and he knows it? Why did we not get that age of consent raised during those 13 years? We begged and pleaded for the sake of children. We should start doing the right things for them. Crimes against children are right out of control today. If members do not believe me, they should dig into it and find out because I have and I have been working on it for 13 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226624">I cannot believe that an adult, a man sitting in the House of Commons, would not fight hard to get rid of child pornography, the biggest junk piece we have in this land and it is destroying youth. What is wrong with the Liberals that they would not get on the ball during these last 13 years and even attempt to do it? What are they afraid of?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="226626">In terms of getting tough on child pornographers and child abuse, absolutely. The most important thing for our children is that they have a good start in life, that they have the health care and the education that they need. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226627">This is why the Liberal government brought in the child care program of $5 billion in order to partner with groups right across this country, so that there would be a good start for these young people. We want them to have the proper training, the proper values, and the proper care that they need when they have working parents. That is how--</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="226630">Mr. Speaker, the feigned indignation of the member opposite is actually quite amusing, considering what my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78373" Type="2">Wild Rose</Affiliation> just said was very true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226631">All through the 13 years that the Liberal government was in power, it failed. The Liberals resisted every attempt by the Conservatives to raise the age of consent from 14 to 16.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="226633">I would say to the member that there are many young children walking around in our communities thinking that they are safe. They have been raised in exactly those conditions and exactly those circumstances. They are being preyed on, on a daily or weekly basis, by the perverts that his government refused to take off the streets. That is the problem. Kids are getting a good start in this country. It is the perverts that are preying on them that his government failed to deal with. One has to wonder why not.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="226640">Mr. Speaker, I have a simple question for the hon. member. He knows very well that in 2001 a shipbuilding policy was laid on the minister of industry's desk. It is now 2006. The Liberal Party, when it was in power, did absolutely nothing for the shipbuilding industry. We are now into nine months of the Conservative government and we still have no word on when a shipbuilding strategy will be announced by any government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226641">My question for the member is quite clear. Although he has some very valid points against the Conservative government, why did his own government not do anything to assist the shipbuilding industry in this country?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="226642">Mr. Speaker, the hon. member will recall that our then minister of industry, now the <Affiliation DbId="79000" Type="96">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation>, had undertaken extensive consultations with the various regions in this country in order to develop a shipbuilding policy, one that would actually work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226643">The number of ships built in this country over the last decade or so has dwindled and declined. If Canada is to have a viable shipbuilding industry, it has to work with all the stakeholders in order to achieve the types of targets and the concentrated efforts that we want.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226644">The Liberal government was working on that very actively when the election was called. I hope that the minister who was so active then is still carrying on the same type of consultations. I fully expect the government to bring forth that shipbuilding policy at an early moment.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="78531" Type="2">Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="226645">Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the NDP caucus to serve notice that we will not support the budget implementation act, Bill <Document DbId="2399029" Type="3">C-28</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226646"> My time does not permit me to outline the many shortcomings of the budget but let me at least say that I am disappointed that we did not get an opportunity to manoeuvre or negotiate any benefits through the budget because five minutes after the budget was tabled in the House of Commons, the leader of the Bloc Québécois walked outside into the scrum area and told all and sundry that it sounded good to him and that he would take it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226647">All the Conservatives needed was a dance partner and they got their dance partner first off, which is when all negotiations stopped. Normally in a minority Parliament there are opportunities for the opposition parties to do a little bit of horse trading. We were denied that opportunity because one party cashed in all its chips before the bargaining even started.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226648">I will simply preface my remarks by saying how disappointed I am as an opposition member of one of the opposition parties that this minority Parliament was not even allowed to function the way minority Parliaments are supposed to operate because of the self-interest and selfish action on the part of the Bloc Québécois.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226649">Let me touch on two reasons why we are disappointed in the budget because time does not permit any more detail than that. I come from the riding of <Affiliation DbId="78531" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation> that used to be represented by Stanley Knowles. Stanley Knowles has a reputation as one of the founders, the father perhaps, of the Canadian pension system. I can safely say that Stanley Knowles would be doing flip-flops in his grave today if he knew that after nine years of surplus budgets by two senior parties in the country, old age security paycheques for low income seniors are actually going down as a result of the budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226650">It sounds shocking. Some would challenge me perhaps to the veracity of those facts. I had to do a lot of research to plough through our arcane and complicated tax system but here are the facts. In actual fact, seniors have walked into my office with their July OAS cheque and their September OAS cheque. It is $10 a month lower. The government actually lowered the basic personal exemption for OAS and GIS senior pensioners. In other words, pensioners are paying tax on $400 a year more than they were last year, which, at a rate of 15.25%, is $60 per year or $5 per month. However, because it is for this six months, it was doubled to average it out over the year. It is $10 a month for this six month period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226651">This only applies to seniors who, because they have such a low income and no other source of revenue, they qualify for the guaranteed income supplement. There is an offsetting pension credit in another category for private pension plans. However, if the person is one of those many low income seniors in my riding who are trying to survive on just his or her old age security and CPP, the person will get less this month than he or she did last month.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226652">Maybe it is a byproduct or maybe it was an unforeseen consequence, I do not know. I am not accusing anybody of trying to starve low income seniors but that was the result and I cannot support it. I cannot do anything but condemn that result and consequence. The Conservatives should really rethink this. Surely, in a time of prosperity and record surpluses, we could do something for our low income seniors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226653">I talked with some anti-poverty groups and they said that the $10 a month probably represents four or even five days of a grocery budget for a low income senior. It is not quite one full week but what they have left over to spend for food, $10 a month is a significant drop. At the very least, it is a quality of life issue. It is one less thing that they will be able to do with their income.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226654">That is one of the reasons I cannot support the budget. The other reason is perhaps what is not in the budget. I cannot understand for the life of me why in the first Conservative budget of a newly formed government, the Conservatives would not have done something to plug the outrageous tax loophole that allows Canadian companies to set up dummy companies offshore to avoid paying their taxes in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226655">
                <B>Mr. Gerry Ritz:</B> Do you have an example?</ParaText>

                <Affiliation DbId="78531" Type="2">Mr. Pat Martin: </Affiliation> The one high profile example in this country that irritates me to no end is the fact that when the Liberals were in power they tore up 10 out of 11 tax havens but left one remaining.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226657">
                <B>An hon. member:</B> Which one?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226658">
                <B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B> Barbados is the one they left remaining, exactly where the former prime minister, the current member for <Affiliation DbId="78571" Type="2">LaSalle—Émard</Affiliation>, has nine of his dummy shell companies shielded from paying Canadian taxes in that particular tax haven. That is offensive to me. One would think a <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">prime minister</Affiliation> of Canada would be proud to pay his taxes in this country. I am not going to dwell on that because that is the past. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226659">We now have a new Conservative government. Surely, it sees what is wrong when tax fugitives can use this blatant tax avoidance by setting up dummy companies. Some estimates say that the lost revenue is $7 billion a year. Why would the government nickel and dime all the little social programs that are important and critical to communities when it leaves $7 billion on the table? Who is it worried about offending?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226660">The interesting thing about the changes to the election financing act is that big business can no longer buy elections or buy politicians. Who are we worried about offending by slamming the door shut on this last outrageous loophole? Big business cannot hurt anyone any more would be my message. We do not have to be afraid of Bay Street any more. We have been liberated. Why do we not stand up on our own hind legs and say that there will be no more freeloading and that companies can no longer be tax fugitives.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="226678">Mr. Speaker, I think we would like to take the cliché one step further. When people say tough on crime, it has become so commonly used that it has become almost meaningless. We prefer to say that we are smart on crime because our activities and our directions are results-oriented.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226679">However, I will give one example where we are working at committee to strengthen one of the crime bills where we think the Conservative government was too soft, and that is the proceeds of crime components of the money laundering bill. We believe the federal government should be able to seize the assets of known criminals who are associated with criminal gangs, not just their bank accounts but their homes, their luxury cars, their luxury motorboats, et cetera. If they cannot show that those luxury items were bought with legitimately earned moneys, then the items should be seized and the reverse onus put on them to prove to us that the items were not the proceeds of crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226680">That would be getting tough on crime and that would ensure that crime does not pay. It would go a long way to send a message to the biker gangs and the criminal organizations that flaunt their wealth and their luxury items right under the noses of the police officers. We believe in giving the police the tools they need to do their jobs and to make the case that crime does not in fact pay.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="226689">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill <Document DbId="2399029" Type="3">C-28</Document>, a bill that implements certain provisions of budget 2006.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226690">The Conservative government's first budget, however, fails to address the real needs of Canadians and Canadian families and it unfortunately fails to move the country forward. About the only positive aspect of this budget is that it builds on the eight consecutive budgetary surpluses delivered by our Liberal government. This budget promises another budgetary surplus and I hope the Conservatives deliver on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226691">Given the strong fiscal record the Conservatives inherited from our former Liberal government, it is outrageous that the government is raising income taxes, slashing spending by $1 billion a year and excluding any real vision for the future of Canada's prosperity. Let me go through some examples of why this budget fails.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226692">It fails to provide real tax relief for low income and middle income Canadians. Eliminating Liberal income tax cuts in favour of a 1% GST cut has been panned by every serious economist in this country as a plan that will benefit higher income Canadians at the expense of the more needy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226693">The Conservatives are hiking income taxes, which means that many people who got a refund for the 2005 tax year will end up paying in 2006. The Conservatives are increasing the basic personal amount by $200 and increasing to 15.5% the lowest tax bracket. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226694">This budget fails to address the issue of climate change. The Conservative government has eliminated climate change programs and is abandoning the Kyoto accord. Its transit tax credit is costly and ineffective. It will cost about $400 million over two years and only increase transit use by 5%. This translates to a cost of $2,000 for each tonne of carbon dioxide saved, 10 to 100 times the cost per tonne under our Liberal government green plan.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="226695">Furthermore, the Conservatives are planning to finance this measure and their climate change plan, which they are still working on, by eliminating $2 billion worth of existing climate change programs. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="226696">Two of these programs are the EnerGuide for houses retrofit program and the wind power production incentive program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226697"> EnerGuide worked. It was helping thousands of Canadian households achieve energy efficiency increases in the range of 30% and doing it in a way that was cost effective. The Conservative government should do the right thing, stand up for the environment and for Canadian consumers, and bring EnerGuide back. Our Liberal government's EnerGuide program supported the retrofitting of more than 100,000 homes for more efficient use of energy before the Conservative government cancelled it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226698">Wind power is another important component of Canada's response to the challenges of energy conservation and global warming. The wind power industry is responsible for thousands of direct and indirect jobs across the country, and our government's wind power production incentive program, or WPPI, as it is affectionately referred to, is essential to attracting investment and ensuring the viability of this industry. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226699">The Conservative government has been exposed on this. We know that these programs were working and were cost effective. I am today calling for the government to immediately reinstate the EnerGuide program and the wind power production incentive program. The Standing Committee on Natural Resources recently adopted motions that also called for the reinstatement of these important programs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="226700">Budget 2006 fails to provide a real child care choice for parents. As if $20 a week for child care is not bad enough, low income parents will be losing the young child supplement of the Canada child tax benefit. The Conservatives are cutting $1 billion from the Canada child tax benefit, a program that the Liberal government brought in and which was supposed to reach $10 billion this year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226701">Budget 2006 fails to establish a real plan to create child care spaces. Rather than honouring the Liberal child care agreements, something that the majority of provinces, parents and advocacy groups had demanded, the government insists on forging ahead with a nebulous plan which will mean that provinces will lose the stable funding agreed to by the previous government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="226704">Budget 2006 fails to make any significant investments in education and innovation. The Liberal government had a concrete vision that would have helped put us at the forefront of competitiveness and innovation. This lacklustre and visionless budget contains virtually nothing in this regard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226705">For example, our last fiscal update provided $2.5 billion for university research. The Conservative budget provides $200 million, less than one-tenth of our commitment. For student aid, our plan would have provided up to $6,000 per student for tuition over a four year program. The Conservative plan provides $80 for textbooks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226706">University students would like to see a portion of the Canada health and social transfer, the vehicle the federal government uses for transferring funds to the provinces and territories for social programs, dedicated to post-secondary education. This request I believe has some merit, provided accountability measures and performance benchmarks can be attached to these transfers along the lines of the 2004 health accord so that Canadians can evaluate how their province or territory is spending their money on post-secondary education and citizens can make comparisons with other jurisdictions. This makes some sense and is an example of a visionary initiative that is totally absent from budget 2006. Eighty dollars for students for textbooks just does not do it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226707">Budget 2006 fails because it cuts programs that help to build a highly trained and competitive workforce, programs like the training centre infrastructure fund. This fund was an important source for unions and management for the building of training centres. Union training centres are formed through partnerships among unions, management and government. They provide workers with the necessary information and on the job training to continuously improve their skills and remain at the top of their field.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226708">The objectives of this partnership include developing and facilitating training programs that not only improve the vocational and safety skills of the industry but also enhance the employability of the students and meet changing and evolving market demands. In order to maintain this standard, training centres must upgrade their equipment and facilities to provide their students with the most innovative technology. The training centre infrastructure fund provided the necessary financial support to allow these centres to equip their facilities.</ParaText>

It also plans to set up a training program to encourage more young people to get into welding.

The U.S. will now dictate what forest policies we will have in Canada. The deals leaves $1 billion on the table in wrongly collected duties and it is in the hands of the U.S. government and U.S. producers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="226721">First, something should be clearly said about the so-called Kyoto plan that the Liberals tried to sell to Canadians. Let me rephrase that. The Liberals tried to ram the so-called Kyoto plan down the throats of Canadian taxpayers. The Liberal plan had unreachable targets and unrealistic goals. As a matter of fact, there is speculation that the plan was written on the back of a napkin. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226722">However, the important thing is this. While they were prepared to try to ram that Kyoto plan down the throats of taxpayers and target greenhouse gases in some obscure way, they were quite prepared to let cities like Vancouver, Toronto and Halifax and other major centres be totally untouched in regard to the air pollution and the smog created in those cities on a daily basis.

              <ParaText id="226747">I remind my hon. colleagues in the Conservative Party that the Liberals did not do anything on this issue. The Conservatives now have an opportunity.

              <ParaText id="226748">As I said in a statement the other day, what happens after November 12 when the poppy comes off? These veterans and their families need assistance from the government in their old age. If the government is not going to provide the assistance when it is swimming in money, when is it going to do it? When will the Conservative Party actually put this program in the budget? There are many programs that should be instituted for veterans and their families, but this one program was promised.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226749">The government cannot stand up and tell us to support our troops and our veterans and not institute the policies that assist them when they need help the most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226750">I remind the Conservative government, and many of my Conservative colleagues, who I consider my good friends, know this to be a fact, that our veterans are Canada's greatest volunteers. They sacrificed their youth so we can stand in this place and argue points of principle in a democratic fashion. It is great to live in a country where politicians can retire and they are not executed. The fact is we can only do that because of the sacrifice of Canadian veterans and their families.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="226751">Just a few days prior to Remembrance Day, these veterans and their widows are asking for these programs, which the government admits itself would save it money, yet it refuses to put them in the document.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226752">What are we supposed to tell Joyce Carter and the thousands of women across the country? Do we tell them that the Conservatives are heartless, that they just write letters that are meaningless, that they are taking advantage of the elderly? Of course not. I do not believe the Conservatives are those types of individuals. However, a letter was written on behalf of their leader, now the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, promising to do it immediately. Nine months later there is not a single word in the documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226753">We in the NDP cannot stand up and allow this to continue. I am hoping either the veterans affairs minister, or the parliamentary secretary or even the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> will stand up in the House very soon, in fact it should be done today, and announce that the VIP program, as was promised, will be extended immediately, without reservation, for those, mostly women in their late seventies and eighties, who cared for our veterans and who are very proud individuals. It is unconscionable that the government would not do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226754">I am offering the Conservatives the olive branch. If they do that, we will support their efforts in the VIP program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226755">We can go on and on regarding the budget. However, there is another item I want to bring forward. I cannot let it go by because I know my colleagues who sit next to me would question me as to my studiousness on it, and this is there is nothing in the budget on shipbuilding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226756">In 2001 the then minister, Mr. Tobin, called a meeting of the industry, labour and communities. They put together a policy called “Breaking Through: Canadian Shipbuilding Industry”. It has been sitting on the desk of the <Affiliation DbId="78770" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> since 2001. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226757">We heard from the previous Liberal member who spoke that the <Affiliation DbId="78741" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation>, who was then a Liberal, said, “We're doing consultations”. Those consultations happened in 2001. The policy is a very thin read. It is only about 10 pages. They asked the previous Liberal government and the Liberals did absolutely nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226758">Now the Conservatives are here. I want to remind my Conservative colleagues that there is a potential of $22 billion worth of economic activity that would keep the five major shipyards in our country alive for a long time. Just maybe a lot of those Atlantic Canadians, who are working out west, can come back home and work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226759">The reason why we have so many Atlantic Canadians working in Ontario and out west is, as we jokingly say, we got all the work done back home and we are just helping the rest of the country out. If the government instituted a shipbuilding policy, the yards in Marystown, Halifax, Levis, Quebec, Port Welland and Vancouver would be humming along for many years. The government knows this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226760"> The Coast Guard, the military, the ferries and the laker fleet need replacements. There are $22 billion of opportunity. What is the government hinting at? Free trade deals with EFTA and Korea, which would put the death knell on our industry. I encourage the government to very quickly announce the shipbuilding policy on replacements for our fleets so our families and our workers across the country can go back to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226761">Again, budgetary times are times of opportunities. As I said on the VIP and the veterans program, the government missed out on that opportunity. It has missed out on the shipbuilding policy. These are lost opportunities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226762">I do not know why for the life of me the government would want to proceed with a budgetary process that allows oil and gas companies, some of the most profitable companies on the planet, swimming in excess profits, further tax breaks while seniors, students, new immigrants, people with disabilities, the environment, all take a back seat. I do not understand it.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="50">(1050)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="226763">I simply do not understand the thinking of the Conservative government. I speak to the individual members of the Conservative Party. I do know that most of them really do care about what they do. The fact is that their government is heading in the wrong direction. I ask them to steer that ship back, to get it on the right track.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226764">We are here representing constituents, not the special interests in the large corporate world. Those are some of the reasons we in the NDP simply cannot at this time support the budgetary process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226765">I must say how disappointed I am in the Bloc Québécois. Many members of the Bloc are very decent hard-working people but within five minutes of the tabling of the budget documents, their leader went out and said, “No problem, we will support it”. He completely gave away the opportunity to negotiate and horse trade with the government. We did that with the Liberals which resulted in previous Bill <Document DbId="1815922" Type="3">C-48</Document>. I was very disappointed with the Bloc and I would hope that the Bloc would reconsider that position so that we can actually negotiate this thing, change it before it goes anywhere and maybe include some of the concerns that I and my hon. colleague from Winnipeg mentioned.</ParaText>

We got the supplementary estimates the other day from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. The estimates very clearly show some pretty drastic cuts to science, health and oceans management. These are the estimates; I did not make them up. The estimates also show quite a reduction in full time equivalents in terms of the people who will be working in the department.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226771">We asked the minister in committee about it. He said in the House and in committee that there will be no cuts to his department. He gave us his own estimates showing cuts and yet he stood up and said that there are no cuts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="226772">The member is absolutely right. We are getting conflicting messages out of the government. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="227088">Mr. Speaker, today I received yet another letter from an organization that has been axed to death by the minority con government, the summer work student exchange program. One would think that summer employment for students would be as high a priority for the government as it has been for the past 12 years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227089">In my riding of <Affiliation DbId="78979" Type="2">Thunder Bay—Rainy River</Affiliation>, as it is with many similar ridings that have medium sized cities along with many smaller communities, we have been hit hard by the cuts to the students, student summer work, literacy, the environment, wind energy, agriculture, economic development, minority groups, volunteers, aboriginals, tourism and heritage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227090">Let me be clear. It is a very good thing that the government has listened to people and has restored funding to museums. There are several museums from Thunder Bay on Lake Superior to communities such as Chapple near the Manitoba border. Oliver Paipoonge, Hymers, Founders, the Northwestern Ontario Sports Hall of Fame, Atikoken and Fort Frances are some of the communities that have plans that would have been hurt by the incompetence of those cuts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227091">Just last week in Fort Frances, when I spoke at a dinner in appreciation of those of Ukrainian heritage, many of those citizens reminded me that it was the NDP that supported the Conservatives. The people of northwestern Ontario also blame the NDP for the jobs lost and plants closed because the Liberal forestry package of $1.4 billion was not implemented. The NDP now talks about the forest industry but everybody who works in that sector knows that it was the NDP that stabbed them in the heart.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227092">It is probably easier to list the damage that this unholy alliance has caused. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227093">First, these include cuts to literacy, when more money is needed, and the Prime Minister's wife asked for money the day after $18 million was slashed from the budget, amazingly harpercritical.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227094">Second, the lowering of every old age security cheque because the Conservatives raised taxes for the poorest in the nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227095">Third, the elimination of the visitors' GST rebate is yet another blow to tourism in northwestern Ontario and, indeed, all of Canada will suffer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227096">Fourth, the damage to community and household environmental groups such as EnerGuide. I can only restate and reiterate my call for the reinstatement of this program. I truly hope the <Affiliation DbId="78760" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation> is listening to Canadians at the field level, in the communities and in their households who know this program was working so well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227097">Fifth, the court challenges program helped the disabled and other minorities and now, as a source of dissent, it has been snuffed out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227098">Sixth, the chainsaw massacre of FedNor's budget by $6.4 million is yet another example of the NDP-Conservative alliance hurting northern Ontario. This part of the nationwide maliciousness of $40 million lost to regional development will hurt our economy in all parts of the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227099">Seventh, the leaders of my urban aboriginal communities and those of the 11 first nations I represent are also outraged by the abandonment of the Kelowna accord.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227100">Eighth, the students of Lakehead University and Confederation College are furious at the spiteful way in which the student jobs, which are so vital to the furthering of their education, have been butchered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227101">Ninth, is another letter, this time from the Fort Francis Volunteer Bureau, stunned by the words of the Conservative government that volunteerism is “not a priority for Canadians”. That is a quote directly from their letter. I believe that everybody shares my amazement at the disregard and disdain for volunteerism shown by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227102">Tenth, northwestern Ontario lost 400 early learning and child care spaces thanks to the loss of the program. For us, for those communities throughout the north, it affects us dramatically. It may not seem like a lot to some people, but for a community to lose 25 or 30 spaces where there were only 35 or 40, it makes a horrendous difference in terms of parents being able to go to work and actually help the local economies.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="227103">Eleventh, for the record I believe the people of Canada were astounded that the NDP members again supported the Conservatives when they voted against our motion that would have restored support to those groups and organizations that are out there helping Canadians on a daily basis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227104">The motion stated:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227105">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That, in the opinion of the House, the government inherited the best economic and fiscal position of any incoming federal government and has not demonstrated the need, value or wisdom of its announced expenditure cuts which unfairly disadvantage the most vulnerable groups in Canadian society.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227106">That is what happens to an organization such as a literacy group in a small community. A cut of $5,000, $10,000 or $15,000 may seem small but in many of these situations each and every one of those groups, whether it is environmental literacy or just plain trying to help their community in volunteerism, that amount of money pulled out of the equation is carnage. It hurts organizations and in fact kills them because they cannot leverage additional funds. It may mean the loss of a part time person but more often than not it will actually end the organization's ability to get funding from the provincial government, private sectors or others. It is the abandonment of federal commitments to people who need it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227107">This is what is really disturbing. Things work in small communities. As I travel through my riding of <Affiliation DbId="78979" Type="2">Thunder Bay—Rainy River</Affiliation>, which has 11 first nations and 16 municipalities, and that is just one riding in northern Ontario and one of dozens in the nation across this country, each time one of those cuts hits someone, something collapses. Something is withdrawn from the community and someone is hurt, which means that those people who were helping can no longer help the many people they were helping.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227108">Let us look at the letter from the Fort Frances Volunteer Bureau which recognized the tremendous assets that volunteers provide. In most communities in the nation, volunteers are the wheels that keep our country going. Indeed, in communities such as that, that douses the flames of community spirit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227109">I would use the community of Atikokan as an example. It came fifth out of several hundred, if not thousands, of Canadian communities that applied to be Hockeyville. The volunteerism and spirit that I saw there was absolutely amazing and inspiring. Indeed, that happens in every community all across this country every hour of every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227110">We have great people who believe in the future and who give of themselves. Whether it is in a museum or helping people learn to read and write, it is a fundamental aspect of our society. For me literacy has long been an issue that is dear to my heart. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227111">Organizations tell me that they need more money. They say that they do not need lot, that they just need enough to keep going so they can give people the tools they need to relate to others, to read and write and to participate fully in society. When $17 million or $18 million is taken out of one program like that and the money is divided into a few thousand dollars across the country, we see the difference. We see these little things implode. People wonder why the government is no longer caring about them and helping them. They thought the purpose of government was to give them assistance when they needed it. They do not ask for much.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227112">People should see the facilities out of which many of these organizations operate. They are not on the 17th floor on Bay Street. They scrounge telephones, fax machines and use computers that are years old. They do what they must do because they believe in helping others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227113">We had a chance to do something but the vote was lost in the House of Commons. I am only encouraged by the fact that the government has at least recognized the museum component of it because many small projects across the country would have been devastated. Can we have EnerGuide back? Can we have literacy back? I believe those are the things that Canadians all over the country are not only asking for but are demanding.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="227115">In the introduction to my colleague's speech, he would have members believe that the reason he and his party were thrown out of office, still picking the feathers off their butt from being tarred and feathered and run out on a rail, was because the NDP kicked them out. For the record, it was actually the people of Canada who kicked them out. The reason they are now isolated in their shame and the reason they are sitting way over there isolated is because the people of Canada were well aware that they broke faith with the Canadian people. They lost their confidence and therefore they lost their jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227116">My colleague is living in some kind of state of denial if he thinks it was the NDP that kicked them out of office. In actual fact, the NDP members are doing their job as opposition MPs and criticizing the budget we are debating today, the budget implementation act. We oppose the bill and the budget and we are speaking against it in a constructive way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227117">Would my colleague not agree that if there were any opposition party on which we should be casting any blame, it would be the Bloc Québécois because five minutes after the budget was tabled in the House of Commons, the leader of the Bloc Québécois walked out of these chambers, stepped in front of a TV camera and said that he liked it and that he would vote for it? At that very moment all negotiations ended because in a minority Parliament the opposition parties could effect some fairly constructive positive changes if one of them did not bail out on the rest of us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227118">Would he not agree that if there is any choleric to be vented at this stage of the implementation of the budget, it should be directed toward the Bloc Québécois and its rampant self-interest?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="227120">Let us just clarify where we are. It is clear that the $1.4 billion forestry package that would have saved hundreds and thousands of jobs in this nation, because of the loan guarantees portion of it, the plant modernization component and the environmental support, was lost to all those workers who are now unemployed because the NDP joined with the Conservatives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227121">Let us be very clear that the early learning and child care program was adopted by all provinces and territories and already had money transferred to them. I will give a concrete example of what is happening in a municipality like Thunder Bay. The provincial money was transferred and is being used over four years, but after those three or four years are up, then the municipalities will all have to raise taxes because early learning and child care will need to be supported by municipalities again. That was done on a community wide basis across this country. The money was there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227122">When we talk about all these things, none of it would have occurred had there not been collaboration. Could the NDP not have waited for the election to be held after these things were up and running? That is a fair question.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="227128"> First of all, I would just like to respond to the comments made by the Liberal members across the way. It really astounds us every time we hear Liberals get up and blame the NDP for their own downfall. They conveniently forget that we had an election and it was the people of Canada, it was the voters in this country, who voted them out because of their arrogance, their corruption, and this sense of entitlement that they have, that they are somehow entitled to power no matter what happens. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227129">It is unbelievable and even after an election, even after the Canadian people have spoken, we still hear this kind of rhetoric coming out of Liberal members. I guess they just do not get it. As the member for <Affiliation DbId="78531" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation> says, I guess they just do not get it and they should be in therapy. It will be a long therapy session, but they have some lessons to learn.</ParaText>

                <B>Ms. Libby Davies: </B> No, we will not have the taxpayers pay for it, they can pay for it out of the Liberal Party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227132">In regard to this budget, the NDP voted against the Conservative budget. We think it was a very poor budget. It was a missed opportunity particularly now that we know there was a $13 billion surplus that could have provided a major reinvestment into some critical programs in Canada that would help Canadians in their daily lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227133">I represent <Affiliation DbId="78906" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation>. I represent a very low income community. A few days ago squatters moved into a low income housing building in the downtown east side. Hundreds of people have been evicted from what we call single room occupancies in that community. Why is that happening? It is because we have not had a federal housing strategy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227134">Even though the NDP fought so hard and actually did get money into the last federal budget, Bill <Document DbId="1815922" Type="3">C-48</Document>, that money has actually not been transferred through to the people who really need it. The same is true for post-secondary education.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227135"> When we look at this Conservative budget, we have to ask a very important question, who gains and who loses? Who wins with this budget? We know that the Conservative government has a multi-year plan for corporate tax cuts. Clearly, there are some winners there, but there is no multi-year commitment for child care, education, training, the environment or housing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227136"> I see people in my community who are really hurting and have a tough time getting by day by day. They are literally destitute on the streets. They get whammed by Gordon Campbell on the one hand because it is now almost impossible to qualify for basic income assistance. They get hit over the head with that or if they are able to get on income assistance, a single person lives on $500 a month, and I defy anybody to try and make it on that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227137">They get hit on that side, but then they get hit on the federal side as well because we have seen an abandonment of a federal responsibility for the provision of housing. I have to say to be clear on the record, it began with the Liberals back in 1993 when the member for <Affiliation DbId="78571" Type="2">LaSalle—Émard</Affiliation> was finance minister. He trashed Canada's wonderful social housing programs, trashed the co-op housing programs, and there was no more federal funding. Then we began this horrible downward spiral of more and more people being caught in the travesty of losing their homes, not being able to rent affordable homes or apartments because none were available and the housing squeeze was on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227138">That has now taken place for more than a decade and we are seeing the consequences of that deliberate public policy brought on by 13 years of Liberal government and now continued on by a Conservative government. We see the impact on our streets. I see that every day in my community and it breaks my heart when I see people who are valiantly struggling to keep going. Yet, here in Ottawa, these mammoth decisions are being made that basically cut millions of people out of the picture and say they do not count, they are not important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227139">This summer we had a serious situation. We were very concerned that the SCPI program, the funds that it earmarked for emergency housing were about to be lost. Our very wonderful housing critic went to work. She drew this to the attention of the public and we actually had the federal minister for HRSD, who is responsible for housing, to make comments in the media that those funds were secure.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="227140">We found last week on the Treasury Board website that there are incredibly significant cuts to the SCPI program, something like 98% of the funds look as though they are gone in the next fiscal year despite what the President of Treasury Board said in the House, that SCPI would continue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227141">I get phone calls and emails continually from people who rely on those funds in the absence of a national housing program. They rely on those emergency funds to provide very basic frontline services, emergency provisions and shelter services. Winter is coming upon us. The out of the cold program will yet again be in jeopardy because of the lack of certainty and security about that program. We are very worried about that. This is real stuff that hits people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227142">I know that other members of the House have raised other questions. Part of the cuts that we just saw recently was to the very popular summer student career program. In my community, not only is it a very good vehicle for ensuring that students can have good jobs during the summer to gain experience, to help them make a little bit of money for tuition, but it is also a very valuable program for local organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227143">In my riding groups like Safe Kids, the Mount Pleasant Neighbourhood House, and the Strathcona Community Centre rely on the summer student career program to provide very important children's programs during the summer. These are often children who are at risk. Their parents are at work. They are young children. Child care is not accessible or after school care is very expensive, again because the government has not bothered to put in a national child care program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227144">Programs like Safe Kids, that are supported through the summer student career program, are now again in jeopardy because we understand from the Treasury Board cuts that they are being re-engineered. In fact, the minister said in the House that the money was going to corporations that will hire people anyway and so the government will retarget it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227145">In a place like east Vancouver where we depend upon these jobs to help young people and kids who are at risk, we need to know that the money is going to be there. Even the money we had was totally inadequate and I was always going to the government to ask if there were additional funds and saying that we wanted to see them in our community. It is money that is being very well spent. It goes directly to support students and it helps the local community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227146">It really causes me a lot of dismay to see these kinds of cuts take place. It is the same with the Status of Women. We see that the mandate of the Status of Women department has changed. It no longer uses the word equality. Lobbying and being an advocate is no longer allowed. Come on, what will be left? There will be nothing left to women's equality</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227147">It seems to me that if the government, as it claims, was interested in efficiencies, as it says, that is fine. It should find those efficiencies, but then re-invest the funds into the programs that need them. That would be sound fiscal management and sound public policy. What it chose to do instead was announce the cuts under the cover of efficiency and basically hurt the most vulnerable people in our society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227148">For those reasons and for many more, we are not supporting the budget. We believe in fiscal responsibility and balanced budgets. We believe in paying down the debt but also re-investing in basic essentials that produce a quality of life for Canadians that I think people value, expect and see as very important in the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227149">Unfortunately, the government has taken us down a different path, one that benefits wealthy individuals and corporations, and leaves behind the most vulnerable in our society. We do not support the budget for that reason.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="227151">The member mentioned many of the actions taken by the Liberal government back in 1993 when the Liberals threw the Conservatives out of power. She forgot to mention that the Liberals had to deal with a huge debt. They had to deal with nine years of mismanagement by the Conservative government. They had to deal with a country that was almost bankrupt. So, at that time, there were tough decisions that had to be made. Looking back, were all of them right? We do not know. Things change.</ParaText>

How does she face them when thousands of jobs have been lost in my riding, right across northern Ontario in fact, and in Canada? When the NDP sided with the Conservatives to cause the election, thousands of people lost their jobs. There was $1.4 billion lined up to help forestry workers right across Canada.

              <ParaText id="227161">Actually, if we did an audit of NDP governments across the country, we would see that they have the strongest record overall of balanced budgets and dealing with debt. </ParaText>

We went from Whitehorse to Vancouver to Fort McMurray to Saskatoon and Portage la Prairie and then out on the east coast to St. John's, Halifax, Quebec City and Toronto. We wound up yesterday afternoon. I think we heard from over 400 witnesses. After a while we got a flavour of what Canadians seem to think about this budget. I have to say that they do not seem to think too much of this budget. In fact, after a while there were patterns that developed in the testimony. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227166">I would have thought that thee Chamber of Commerce would have been an organization that would instinctively or intuitively support Conservative budgets.

              <ParaText id="227173">The first one is the new Canada employment credit. That sounds like a good idea on the face of it. If a person's income is from something other than employment, for example, a pension, investments, or things of that nature, this tax credit is utterly useless to that person. What is the point? Why would the government do that as opposed to bumping up the personal base exemption or reducing rates generally overall? We want to favour this over that. It speaks to the Chamber of Commerce position that the government has introduced a myriad of tax credits that end up complicating the system way beyond where it needs to be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227174">There is a textbook tax credit. That is just great. That is just wonderful. A student has 80 bucks worth of tax credits and a $5,000 tuition bill. That is a choice one makes. An $80 tax credit for goodness' sake is going to buy one textbook. That is great. The student can buy the textbook, but he or she cannot get into the school.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227175">Witness after witness would say to the committee that this is lunacy. What people need is better access. That request would come generally from the student groups. They had some good ideas, all of which were ignored in the budget. The university side and the college faculty side want better infrastructure. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227176">What they are really panicked about, and they should be, is that the various foundations that were funded over 13 years of Liberal government, those funds are not being replenished. As a consequence, the universities are afraid that the brain gain that we have had in the last few years will reverse itself again and become a brain drain. This could happen because there is no money available for the new applications that researchers put in.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="227177">Those folks are highly mobile people. They can do their research in California as well as they can do it in Toronto. They can do their research in New York as well as they can do it in Halifax. If we do not keep these foundations well funded with the ability to provide grants to do the leading edge research which has made Canada the number one publicly funded research country in the world, then these folks will find other places in which to do their research. What did the Conservative Party offer? An $80 book credit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227178">Then we come to public transit passes. That sounds great, but it is going to cost something in the order of about $900 million. It will cost $900 million to, in theory, increase ridership by 5%. That is a pretty expensive increase in ridership, $900 million on an annual basis. That does not build one kilometre of subway in my riding, not one kilometre. It does not even build a station. It does not replace any of the TTC buses in my riding, in the city of Toronto or in the GTA. It does none of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227179">That is great; I have my tax credit. I am now going to get a tax deduction after I file my tax return, which has become so complicated that I now have to hire somebody to prepare my return. I am going to hand it in but I am not going to take the bus because the bus has flat tires all the time. These are utterly brilliant choices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227180">Then there is a credit for trades tool expenses. I kind of like that. What is wrong with that? Folks should be able to deduct their tool expenses. If one really thought about it for more than two minutes, one would say that a deduction for employment expenses should be broadly based because most people do not make their living in the trades. Most people make their living in services. We are becoming a services oriented country, so this particular credit is useless to most people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227181">The children's fitness tax credit is another one. I play hockey. My kid is a swimmer. I paid literally thousands of dollars annually for my daughter to swim. She is a nationally rated swimmer and now swims with McMaster University. I am going to get that credit. I kind of like that idea. I am happy about that, but my other daughter who dances is not going to get a credit. If any of my other children were participating in artistic endeavours, the credit would not be there.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="227195">To try to summarize it in a one minute response is going to be a bit tricky, but we can basically divide the issue into two.

              <ParaText id="227201">The focus of the Liberal Party is to raise the basic personal exemption. The focus of the Liberal Party is to lower the rates at which the thresholds hit and to raise the thresholds themselves. That is broad base tax relief. By getting into a situation of this credit for this person and that credit for that person, all it does is creates a make-work project for a bunch of accountants. It also imposes huge administrative burdens on a variety of people who are in no way able to deal with them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227202">The answer to his question is that we are in favour of broad base tax relief. Whether it would also include credits, it may well do. The credits would be higher credits an they would be right across the board. The credit would not be just for physical activity. It would have to be activity. If one is going to go down that route, one might as well go the whole way, and the whole way is one has to cover the artists, the musicians, the athletes, pretty well everyone. In which case, one might as well just raise the basic personal exemption and that way everybody benefits.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="227207">Mr. Speaker, in the few minutes that are available to me, I very much appreciate the occasion to participate in the debate on the government's budget implementation bill. It will not surprise any of my colleagues here in the House of Commons to know that, like my NDP colleagues, I will not be supporting this flawed, short-sighted and meanspirited bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227208">I am proud of the work that my leader and my colleagues have done, both here in the House of Commons and out across the country, to draw attention to the errors and omissions, the missed opportunities and the misplaced priorities of the bill that is before us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227209">I have heard from a great many people, certainly, from many parts of the country, in relation to the failure of the budget to in any significant way address areas for which my critic responsibilities apply, those of international development and foreign affairs. I do not have the opportunity to speak at length about that today, except to say that the disappointments in the budget as they relate to dealing with domestic issues certainly are matched by the profound sense of disappointment felt by a great many people across this country that we have yet again shown no significant progress in meeting our international obligations to seriously commit to the eradication of poverty and to preventable disease in the very poorest parts of the world. We have a lot of work to do on that front.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227210">I have also heard, not surprisingly, from a great many of my constituents. I will just very briefly refer to one of many messages received by e-mail, letter and in person. One that came to me is a longer one than I have time to read, but it speaks about the budget, stating that “the Harper government” has confirmed “one of the largest budget surpluses in Canadian history, a whopping $13.2 billion”.

Despite all of the talk about addressing child care, it simply does not do so. The fact is that family allowances will effectively be diminished, because the budget is now going to tax the $100 a month allowance and will be eliminating the young child supplement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227215"> The fact is that pollution undoubtedly will go up because, just like the Liberals before them, these Conservatives have no plans to seriously tackle, with detailed plans, targets and timetables, greenhouse gas emissions and to get on with serious reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="227219">Others who participated came because they are very concerned about the lack of new housing initiatives in this budget and the continuing failure, right up to as recently as yesterday, to confirm in any kind of detail the continuation of SCPI funds and the commitment to new funds to basically rebuild what was once the best national housing program in the world, which was simply killed by the previous prime minister when he was serving as finance minister.

It is really about the ability of Canadians to come together around who we are and who we want to be in today's world.</ParaText>

This has to be one of the most cost effective programs from the point of view of the opportunities given to young people on their way to building careers in international service. This cut also is a real blow to the NGOs that depend upon the very significant contributions and skills of our young people in their hard-pressed, seriously underfunded agencies.</ParaText>

I am not permitted to do that and I did not intend to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227233">I welcome the question from the member for <Affiliation DbId="78349" Type="2"> Fredericton</Affiliation>. By chance, the very next item I was going to speak about if I had not run out of time was the court challenges program, which serves as a screaming example of the hypocrisy of this government. I have to say that for a government whose members in opposition constantly talked about being the real grassroots democratic voice of Canadians, it is stunning to watch the many different ways in which they are trying to quash any meaningful advocacy and any meaningful discussion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227234">It is doubly hypocritical because, with great enthusiasm, the government has taken up the notion that we should really push our overseas development assistance obligations aside, or at least cut down on the extent to which that should be a really high priority, and instead commit to “democracy building” in failing and fragile states.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227235">I absolutely think we should be committed to democracy building in failing and fragile states, but there is an expression, “Physician, heal thyself”, and maybe we could tweak that a little and say, “Politician, would-be democrat, heal thyself”. As for us going around the world on this, I worry about where this government really wants to take us in this democracy building exercise, because that can go as far as talking about regime change that causes chaos in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227236">Even acknowledging that an element of our overseas development commitment should involve contributing to the kind of capacity building and to the political sensitization of people who need and want to build a stronger foundation for democracy, it is unbelievable to me that this government is busy quashing dissent and cutting off opportunities for democratic expression everywhere we turn.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="227243">Mr. Speaker, It is an honour to stand in the House and speak to this important issue. One could suggest that there is no more important issue that a government brings to the House than the budget. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227244">When I talk to constituents about the proposals that have been put forward by the government they see this budget as an opportunity missed. Quite frankly, it is an opportunity missed because when we look at the fiscal accounting presently, we see that most recently there was a surplus of $13 billion of Canadians' money that we all contributed to in the general pot.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227245">When the government was in opposition it was very clear on its concern, which we agreed with, that before the money that is in the surplus side of the equation goes to deal with the accumulated debt, we should have a debate and Canadians should have an opportunity to suggest where those moneys would go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227246">We saw most recently that the government, instead of taking its own advice when it was in opposition, and instead of having a debate and talking about where the $13 billion of surplus should go, it decided, with the stroke of a pen, to make the decision for Canadians on where the money should go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227247">Strangely enough, the government also decided to cut a billion dollars worth of programs, programs that affect everyday people. For example, the billion dollars in cuts affected people who are working in communities, be it here in Ottawa or across the country, who volunteer their time and sweat to help out local museums. This is one of the strangest cuts I have seen in a long time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227248">The government cut summer employment programs. The rationale was that these were subsidies for the private sector. I am not sure if it looked at the list that most of us look at each year to look at the summer employment opportunities, but I know in my riding none of them were subsidies to private sector ventures. In fact, all of them were helping out community based, not for profit enterprises.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227249"> For example, the Vietnamese Community Association cobbled together moneys for a summer employment program and, with the help of a meagre amount of money from the federal government, it put together a summer work employment program that gave an opportunity for youth to help it with the work that it does, helping people every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227250">These kinds of opportunities for students in summer employment programs not only help these community based groups, but they also give opportunities for youth to be apprentices in certain areas, to gain very valuable experience in administration and be able to contribute to their community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227251">At the same time as the government had the $13 billion surplus, other cuts had to do with people who are working in areas to help people who are most disadvantaged and people who are working in the area of literacy. We have heard a lot about that. Giving people an opportunity to climb out of the darkness of illiteracy is something I believe is not only something government should do, it is something the government must do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227252">To see people who recently were in the news who were well into their eighties speaking publicly about coming out of the darkness of illiteracy and being able to finally contribute and be a full-fledged citizen is something that not only tugs one's heart strings but, more important, it allows us to understand the importance of these programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227253">We had the government with this proposition in opposition, which said that when we have a surplus of Canadians' money, not the Liberal Party's money, not the Conservative Party's money, not the Bloc's money and not the NDP's money, we should be able to debate this. The Conservatives were very vigorous in opposition on this and we agreed with that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227254">One of the reasons we support and we propose to have someone oversee the budget spending, which we see in Bill <Document DbId="2158135" Type="3">C-2</Document>, is for this very reason. We do not just have the money holus-bolus written off because the Liberal Party, or the Conservative Party in this case, decides it should go wherever it likes. It should be opened up and there should be evaluation. We are hoping to see that when Bill <Document DbId="2158135" Type="3">C-2</Document> comes into effect. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="227255">It did not happen with the Conservatives because it was just $13 billion and away it went with no debate. They went against what they said in opposition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227256">We need to look at how the process works. The billion dollar cuts, to which I referred, and the $13 billion surplus were outside of the budgetary framework and did not allow us as parliamentarians to debate it. We are bringing it up with regard to the billion dollars and will have motions brought to the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227257"> One with which I am sure the government will have a problem is the rebate to tourists. It obviously did not do its homework on that. It suggested only 3% of tourists take advantage of it but the government forgot that when people are in countries of origin that is when they take advantage of the GST rebate. Obviously it forgot to ask people how the program works and did not get the right statistics on it. We will probably see the government flip-flop on that. With that program the government showed the haste with which it made the cuts and it did not build it into the budget. It was in-between the budget of last year and the budget that will be coming up in the spring.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227258">What is happening here is that the government is changing the mechanisms of how we debate as parliamentarians with regard to how citizens' money should be spent or, in this case, how their money is taken away. That is of concern because every citizen expects us to represent them and they expect that we will follow the rules and procedures of the House. To have a billion dollars worth of cuts without allowing us to have a debate on it is very problematic. Proposed cuts should come before the House for debate to ensure that everyone is fully aware of how it will affect our communities and the bottom line of the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227259">This process and procedure of fiscal management should be done within the budgetary process and not the surprises that we have seen from the government, both on the surplus and the billion dollar cuts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227260">The final thing I will say about the billion dollar cuts is that they were clearly ideological cuts. We know the previous government booked more than the government cut when the previous prime minister came into power. In fact, he was going to cut five times as much. We know that was booked and that the government had to exact those savings. We see that now with the $2.5 billion it will try to get out of procurement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227261">I will take a minute to focus on procurement. The previous government went to Chicago and hired a consulting group. It was supposed to cost $1.5 million for the Chicago consulting group, A.T. Kearney, to come up with a plan on how the government could save money through reverse bid auctioning, which has been thrown out at this point. However, the price of the contract escalated all the way to $24 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227262">My constituents became aware of this contract and when I became aware of it I mentioned it in the House. We had a contract, to be clear, that started off at $1.5 million and ballooned to $24 million. The icing on the cake was that the information the government got from A.T. Kearney was useless. That was what everyone in this town told the government before, that it was on the wrong track. We had to get the attention of the government to tell the government it was on the wrong track. Finally, it canned the project after we had sent $24 million to the consulting company out of Chicago. In my opinion, that is fiscal mismanagement. We thought we were done with that kind of mismanagement with the previous government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227263">I could go on about all the other programs that were affected and the missed opportunities here for young people, for post-secondary education, the no help for seniors and the child care plan that is a child care scam, but I will save that for another day. For reasons aforementioned, I cannot support the budget.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="227273">He said: Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank the large number of people who have aided in my understanding of this issue. They are parents, community activists and autism support workers. They are Canadians concerned about something that is unfinished business for Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227274">This is a moment when the national government can step up, accept responsibility within the context of its own authorities in this Confederation, and show leadership on this issue. This is a very rich country and, as such, we can no longer afford to look the other way in terms of this rather outrageous limitation of what is available through the public health insurance program in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227275"> I understand there are jurisdictional limitations to which we have to attend, but within that there is an opportunity to show leadership on this file, to work with provinces, to encourage them and incent them to deal with those areas, such as research and evidence-based public policy and standards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227276">The motion appeals to the government to show that leadership and to Parliament to ask the Government of Canada to do that. The rationale for this is relatively simple and stunningly inconsistent with my view of my country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227277">The reality is when parents are told their child, at 18 months old, has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, depending upon how profound that condition might be, the effect on the child for the rest of his or her life could be incredibly limiting. Then they are told that there are treatments, therapies and things that can be done, but they are expensive. They may cost them their house. It means that somebody probably has to stay at home, which may cost a parent a job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227278">This is unacceptable in a country that prides itself on its public health care system. We have to move on this, and the Government of Canada can show leadership on this issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227279">I am former assistant deputy minister of intergovernmental affairs with the province of New Brunswick. I understand the jurisdictional issues, but we cannot let those jurisdictional issues get in the way of doing what we know to be the right thing as a national government for Canadian citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227280">I became most aware of this as the member of Parliament for Fredericton. I have a military base at CFB Gagetown. When members of the forces were transferred to New Brunswick, if they happened to have children who were diagnosed with autism, they would call me to say that they needed to get back to Edmonton or some other place in the country. As a parliamentarian, as somebody who feels an obligation to those military personnel who serve our country, I was concerned. However, I was also concerned as a New Brunswicker. What does that say about everybody else who lives in New Brunswick, who would wish to have those services that are better provided in other places in the country?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227281">The other thing that has been revealed to me is all the treatments and therapies available. It is a spectrum disorder so I do not think we can get caught in a narrow debate about this one or that one. The reality is there are things out there at which we need to look. There are things available today that work and they need to be supported by the government so they can be used by parents and families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227282">I like to see this as a rights issue, something that we do because it is the right thing to do. However, if I cannot convince everybody to do it for that reason, just think about the long term costs of not doing intervention early and now. Think about what that means in terms of the life of that individual and the role the state will have to play. If it is not enough to simply speak to the rightness of this issue, then we should realize that the state will carry a tremendous cost if we do not do the right thing early.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="227283"> In putting forward a motion to Parliament to appeal to the government, the process I envision would be the national government would recognize that medicare formularies are the jurisdiction of provincial governments. The national government could work with provincial governments, on behalf of Canadian citizens, to advance this issue, with the ultimate objective being that the treatment and care of Canadians with autism would be covered under medicare. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227284">We cannot do that from here and we accept that. However, we can show leadership, offer incentives, do the research and establish surveillance so we can do good evidence-based public policy. Those are all things that are clearly under the purview of the national government. Until we do those things, we really do not have any right to expect the provinces to do the right thing. When we do those things, then we will have a stronger moral position on the other issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227285">Again, I want to ensure that it is understood. I know this will be a difficult issue for the government to deal with because of the jurisdictional issue. That is an understood aspect of this debate. I do not think for a second that should allow the national government not to do the things within its purview. It will make it more difficult for the provinces to say no. More optimistically, it think it will encourage the provinces to do the right thing as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227286">I would like to thank a number of people. The seconder for this motion, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78886" Type="2">Sackville—Eastern Shore</Affiliation>, has long been a champion on this issue. In fact, when my bill was drawn in the process earlier than his, he offered me the opportunity to put this forward so it would be a votable motion, and I appreciate that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227287">I appreciate the many meetings I have had with representatives of the government. I believe the government genuinely would like to find a way to get this done.

I question why all autistics across Canada can't get the same level of services within reasonable wait times.

Does it not make sense to invest in trying to facilitate the ability of autistics to achieve their potential as productive citizens? The alternative is an immense cost to society in long-term care. AUTISM does not discriminate, it does not wait, it does not stop at age 6.

We have the opportunity to show the leadership, to do the research, to make money available, to do the surveillance and to do good evidence-based public policy to ensure that parents know what treatments are working, where they are, who does them and so on. That is critically important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227297">Also, I thank a Grade 12 political science classroom in Fredericton. Last year the classroom, which graduated in June, took on the project.

They had somebody in who drafts legislation for the Province of New Brunswick. They have committed themselves to this.

In a country with this kind of wealth, and Canada is a wealthy country, and in a country that takes such pride in our public health insurance program, as Canadians, regardless of jurisdiction, we need to step up and say this is wrong and it needs to end.

              <ParaText id="227305"> I frankly prefer to feel that as a nation we would do the right thing because it is the right thing to do, but if that is not enough, the reality is that this will save the provinces that are engaged in it and the nation enormous amounts of money. The upfront costs associated with intervention are so much less than the lifetime costs of not intervening. It is not really even arguable. To answer the question specifically, that would be the answer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227306">One of the things we really do have to recognize is that the federal government must be compelled to show leadership on this to pull all the provinces together. In the Maritimes, if New Brunswick stepped up and really did this better than everybody by a long shot, which it should and I wish it would, but if it did, there would be people who would relocate to my province specifically to have access to this service. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227307">That is one of the reasons I am fearful that provinces would be a little reluctant to step up and do the right thing.

He noted that for members from every party represented here in Parliament this is a very important issue that we are discussing today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227317">I am also here today to speak on behalf of the children with autism and their families that I have met in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="78914" Type="2">Langley</Affiliation>, British Columbia. It is my privilege to represent them in the House of Commons. I want to thank them for sharing their stories with me and opening their homes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227318">Autism is a complex, lifelong condition and there are many unknowns. We recognize that more and more children are being diagnosed with autistic disorders. All members of the House are sympathetic to the motion, as are all the parties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227319">In the last six years the number of children reported with autism spectrum disorders, ASD, has grown by more than 150%. It is estimated that one out of every 165 children are now affected, but the numbers are growing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227320">I want to tell the House about Maisie Kilgour, Xander Jones, Reid Black, Zoe Schmidt, Casey Walton and Miki. Their parents invited me into their homes, so I could witness their lives and listen to their stories. These parents and parents like them work tirelessly to make their daily choices and challenges understood, to make the fear of their children's future understood, and to ask for some help with their heavy burden.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227321">Walking down that difficult road are the endless burning lights of hope, courage and strength. They have hope that their children's stories can be heard by those of us that can make the change happen and courage to face each day with the same struggle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227322">Children such as Maisie, Xander, Miki, Reid, Casey and Zoe are funny, warm and intelligent. They are worth our recognition, time and commitment. I wish to share with members the individual stories of two of these children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227323">Maisie is a sunny, energetic, five-year old girl with pigtails who works with her therapist in a room full of toys. She performs the task asked of her in between giggles and rewards, and praise from her therapist. At three years of age, Maisie had echolalia. It is a problem of repeating words with no meaning, unable to ask for help. She spent much of her time in tantrums or trying to escape out of her house unaware of danger.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227324">Today, with a marked decrease in tantrums and escapes, Maisie's family faces these challenges with a child who can now speak to them and her words have meaning. She is a child who has now become aware of the world around her. She is building on her successes every day on her way toward a tomorrow filled with a great potential.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227325">Reid was diagnosed with autism just before he turned two. He did not make eye contact. He would not respond to his name. He would sit flipping books all day. Two years have gone by and Reid, now four, makes eye contact, responds to his name, and is able to communicate his needs, his likes and dislikes, his love for preschool, playing at the park, and enjoying the people in his life. Through intensive therapy, Reid has made tremendous gains and is a happy, loving little boy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227326">From these two stories of children in my riding, we know that ASD affects people in different ways. It can cause serious developmental disabilities in affected individuals and can affect all aspects of development. Severe symptoms, such as compulsive behaviours and speech disorders, can lead to isolation from friends, family and the community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227327">Canadian families of individuals diagnosed with ASD may face serious challenges, such as their child's development, behavioural issues, getting a clear diagnosis, access to professional assistance, and the high costs of therapy and other services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227328">The new Conservative government is committed to helping individuals with ASD and their families. In budget 2006 this new government included an increase in the maximum annual child disability benefit to $2,300 from $2,044, effective July 2006. It is available to families of children with autism. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="227329">This government wants to help families dealing with ASD and support to the tax system is one avenue of federal action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227330">There are government agencies working on its behalf on this issue. For example, the Public Health Agency of Canada is funding two autism-related projects through its Centres of Excellence for Children's Well-Being. Both projects are working to generate better information for frontline providers and their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227331">The Canadian Health Network, a key information service of the agency, works in collaboration with expert organizations to provide consumer focused, on-line resources on such issues as autism. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227332">Some communities have used the funding through the community action program for children to focus on the needs of children with autism and again, their families. The government also funds community-based initiatives for children including children who have ASD and funds organizations working in the area of autism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227333">Another way this government is showing support for families is by committing resources to research support. We recognize that part of the challenge for families, caregivers, health and social service professionals and government is how much is unknown regarding ASD. We recognize that research is critical to unraveling the mysteries around autism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227334">This government recognizes that there is no consensus on adequate and appropriate treatment, the cause of ASD or why the reported incidence is on the rise. We support research on autism in Canada through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. In 2005-06 the Canadian Institutes of Health Research is funding approximately $3.5 million in autism-related projects with total funding since 2000 of close to $15 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227335">I would like to share a few of the projects being funded by CIHR. Dr. Jeanette Holden of Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario is examining the causes, origins and effects of ASD, and the effects of the treatment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227336">Dr. Hélène Ouellette-Kuntz, also at Queen's University, is leading a team which has created a national database for the study of autism in Canada. This database is being used to monitor the occurrence of autism in children under the age of 15 in regions across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227337">Finally, Dr. Edward Ruthazer of the Montreal Neurological Institute is conducting research studying brain circuitry during the development years to help increase our understanding on how the brain works with the emphasis on autism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227338">The government is pleased that the issue of autism spectrum disorder has been referred to the standing Senate committee and looks forward to its advice on the federal role in this area, and how individuals with autism and their families can best be supported.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227339">In conclusion, provinces and territories have the jurisdiction over the kinds of health and social services required to address autism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227340">I think and consider Maisie, Xander, Miki, Reid, Zoe, and Casey, and their families and their friends, this generation's pioneers to help us and the reason that the future for people with autism must be brighter. We need to work together and find solutions.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="78439" Type="2">Ms. Nicole Demers (Laval, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="227341">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise today to take part in the debate on Motion M-172. People are always somewhat reluctant to talk about pervasive developmental disorder. The same is true when it comes to talking about cancer: no one can remain indifferent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227342">The term “pervasive developmental disorder” can at first seem very vague. It is used to describe specific problems that affect the overall development of the child, particularly, cognitive, social, emotional, intellectual, sensory and language problems. Autism is the most well known.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227343">In Quebec, 46,500 people have autism or a pervasive developmental disorder. This affects four or five boys for every girl. Boys are more often affected by these disorders. It is also defined as a neurological disorder characterized by a disturbance in the global development of the individual in all areas of functioning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227344">The Fédération québécoise de l'autisme et des autres troubles envahissants du développement is the only provincial organization and the only organization to support those with autism in Quebec. However, 80 agencies in Quebec belong to the federation, which is, in turn, a member of the Autism Society Canada. The federation is a frequent partner with the Quebec department of health and social services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227345">However, the federation has not had much contact with the federal government to date. There was just one intervention within the framework of support for training. The federation believes that the federal government should not get involved in this debate because it finds it hard to believe that supplementary structures coming from Ottawa would have a real impact in the field. It also believes that the intervention strategies are much more likely to involve local players, community groups, CLSCs and schools and that the need is quite simple: money. We are still talking about the fiscal imbalance, unfortunately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227346">In Quebec, since 2002, we have had our own program. As usual, in Quebec, we are ahead of the game. We tend to come up with our own programs before many of the other provinces do because, yes, we pay more taxes, and, yes, we spend a lot more on our social programs—as some have pointed out—but, yes, we are taking care of the health of our citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227347">There are therefore services that were created for people with pervasive developmental disorder, for their family and loved ones. The organization of the services in Quebec's plan of action is based on social integration, social participation, responsibility of the parents in the development of their child and the interaction between people and their environment. The objectives are to implement an integrated services approach, to offer target recipients a wide range of the services they need in their community, to provide them with the tools to properly support the optimal development of their potential and their social integration process, to obtain adequate support for the families and loved ones and to foster cooperation between the various sectors of intervention, child card services, continuing education and various players in the community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227348">The priorities set out in this plan of action are: to provide services based on the needs of the person and their family, including: information, awareness, pervasive developmental disorder detection, diagnosis, patient navigators, access to services, comprehensive needs assessment, specialized adjustment and rehabilitation services, services for school-aged children, services for adults, residential support, accommodation and suitable support for families. As hon. members can see, every effort has been put into providing as much help as possible to people with autism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227349">We also seek to focus on partnerships with other public, semi-public and community service sectors. In Laval, we are ahead of the times. Mr. Germain Lafrenière has established Les Entreprises Qualité de Vie, which operates an organic farm, BioFerme Laval, and also Table champêtre BioFerme Laval. This is a social economy enterprise that promotes access to various trades for individuals with a pervasive development disorder, autism or an intellectual disability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227350">The social and occupational integration of the participants is supported by professionals who understand the needs of these individuals, who gain confidence and pride along with their practical training.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="00">(1400)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="227351">Each participant learns about various trades and activities including farming, arts and crafts, ceramics, cooking, small animal husbandry, sales, and of course the farm's restaurant. I would like to quote from an article written by a journalist who visited this organic farm. She went away feeling very satisfied with and even enchanted by the experience. She wrote: </ParaText>

The Sainte-Dorothée enterprise has a dual mission, one more vital than the other: not only does it offer an impressive array of fresh food at its restaurant, shop and farm gate, but it also provides autistic individuals with the opportunity to achieve their potential through their work.

              <ParaText id="227360">Clearly, Quebec has a plan. It knows what people with autism and their families need, and it has put in place services to meet those needs. What is missing is money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227361">We in the Bloc Québécois recognize the importance of fighting to find a treatment for autism and to provide patients and their families with the support they need to have appropriate quality of life. I agree with my colleague that this is important, but only Quebec and the provinces can determine what services are needed for people with autism and their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227362">Government intervention should happen in collaboration with local partners, community education organizations, and other sectors under provincial jurisdiction. We are, however, opposed to the federal government developing a national autism strategy. It would be interfering yet again in an area under provincial jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227363">Quebec already has its own policies. This would be a costly duplication of what is already in place. Instead, the federal government should transfer funds directly to Quebec and the provinces so they can use the money in their own programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227364">Correcting the fiscal imbalance will give Quebec and the provinces the freedom to make their own choices and to implement effective programs for people with autism.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="227365">Mr. Speaker, sometimes we sit in the House of Commons and wonder if a day like this will ever arrive and today it has.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227366">Before I begin I would like my hon. colleague from the Bloc to know that this is exactly what we are trying to do, to work with the provinces. It will be the provinces that deliver the treatment, and we know that, but what is required is some fiscal assistance from the federal government as well. That is part of the national autism debate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227367">We hope the Bloc Québécois will support the motion of the hon. colleague from Fredericton so we can actually have this debate. The health minister or the Premier of Quebec could sit down with the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and other premiers and territorial leaders and discuss how we deal with this very important subject. That is really what we are debating today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227368">While I am here, Mr. Speaker, I have to tell you what happened on my road to Damascus conversion on the concerns of autism which happened a few years ago. While I was walking outside on Parliament Hill, I saw a gentleman named Andrew Kavchak who had a sandwich board sign. The curious person that I am, I spoke to him, which led to a very serious friendship. He introduced me to a woman named Laurel Gibbons who is the mother of a child with autism. Through her initiative, she has worked very diligently with all groups of people with autism. It does not matter whether it is the national autism group, provincial groups or the FEAT group, Families for Early Autism Treatment, and individual members of Parliament and senators, she will talk to anyone about it. Her dedication to not only her child but to other families with children with autism is unbelievable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227369">I know it is hard to believe but after that I met a certain gentleman from Ottawa who happens to be with us right now. I want to read his card. There are not many 12 year olds in the country who, because of a notice in a magazine in Ottawa, could be one of the top 50 people to watch out for in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227370">This young man is named Joshua Bortolotti. On his business card it says, “Autism Awareness Advocate and aspiring future Prime Minister of Canada”. By the way, he does not have autism but his little sister does. For Sophia Bortolotti, his sister, we should be able to tell young Joshua and his family and all the Joshuas of this world, the aspiring prime ministers, that this is the opportunity we get to tell this young 12 year old who is fighting for his sister and who I wish could have the opportunity to speak here in the House, what we will do today after this rather rational and very serious debate. Do we tell him that yes, maybe there will be the day that his sister and many other children like her across the country will have the opportunity to get the treatment that they require so they can live productive and normal lives in this country to the best of their ability? Or, do we tell them, because of crass politics and jurisdictional squabbles we are not able to do it?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227371"> I know many colleagues and friends of mine in the Conservative Party know this issue is very serious. I know many members of the Bloc and the Liberal Party also know it. I also know that Senator Jim Munson of the other place is a strong advocate for early intervention and cooperation between the federal, provincial and territorial jurisdictions to get this done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227372">When we speak of young Joshua Bortolotti, in the riding of the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78349" Type="2">Fredericton </Affiliation> there is a school called the Leo Hayes High School, I believe, which has either a principal or a teacher named Greg Peters. I have received all kinds of tremendous letters from that school. This class of young activists, of all the causes that are out there, decided to take up the cause of autism. They have written to all of us, in both official languages, and they are probably watching the debate now, encouraging and watching all members of Parliament to see how we move this debate forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227373">It is a tremendous day. It does not matter who moves the bill or what government does or whose name is attached to anything. This is the opportunity for members of Parliament to work together in a constructive manner to once and for all develop a strategy with the provinces, with various agencies and research firms and the providers of the care to actually say to those families with children with autism that here we go.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="10">(1410)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="227374">In my own riding, we have a military person who has a child who is a flight risk. Every single access to their house is locked. If that door opens just a crack, that little son of theirs will take off and run and run until physically he either drops or gets hit by something.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227375">That is just one of the concerns about a child with autism. There are many of them who are voice challenged; they do not speak. Many of them react in ways that they do not fully comprehend or understand. The concerns for the families are not only the financial costs, but the emotional strain on families knowing that they give up their jobs, they sell their house, and they lose all possible equity. It takes money away from other children in the family. They themselves will pour all their resources into their child with autism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227376">Here, I believe, is where as Canadians we could something for those families. We all know, those of us who have been interacting with them and seeing them, that children with autism are some of the most beautiful children in the world. They are warm, they are generous and they are kind, but these people are just looking to us for indications of leadership, indications that we can work together, indications that they will not lose everything in order to provide the treatment their children need. We have that opportunity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227377">Recently I was in British Columbia with my colleague, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78728" Type="2">New Westminster—Coquitlam</Affiliation>, and we did a press conference with folks with autism. I met a young mother, and by the way, her sister happens to be my next door neighbour, which is quite a coincidence. She has two children with autism, not one but two, and the financial concerns are completely unbelievable. It is also the emotional strain on the families as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227378"> The hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78349" Type="2">Fredericton</Affiliation> is absolutely correct. We have the opportunity now to say to those thousands of families in this country, crossing all political lines, that we are going to step up to the plate. We are no longer going to wait for every single person in the country to agree to every single dot of the <I>i</I>'s and crossing of the <I>t</I>'s.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227379"> We have cross-political support on both sides of this chamber. We have tremendous numbers of people across the country who are saying that now it is time for government to move on this. In the era of tremendous fiscal surpluses, we are not asking the federal government to do this on its own. We would not do that because we understand the provincial jurisdictions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227380">The provinces themselves have challenges on this. I really compliment the province of Alberta because its treatment goes to age 18, while in my own province of Nova Scotia it is a sort of trial program. It is spotty. The province does not have anything constructive. In Ontario, treatment is until age 6, so what we are saying to families is that if they want treatment, maybe they should move to Alberta, but that puts tremendous strain on the Alberta economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227381">What we are saying to the national government, working with provinces and territories, is to let us have the meetings that we need to take place to set the ball rolling. If we do that, then we are telling Laurel Gibbons, a mother with a child with autism, and we are telling young Joshua, who is arguing and fighting in such a great way for his little sister, Sophie, that yes, their advocacy has worked, and yes, their tireless efforts on behalf of her daughter and his sister have been noticed and mentioned. We would also be saying it to the school in Fredericton that has done tremendous work in taking on this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227382">It is a proud day as a member of Parliament, not just as a member of the NDP, but as a member of Parliament, with all my colleagues in the House, to stand here and give my thanks to the hon. member, to thank the Chair and to thank each and every one in this House for making this a reality and a possible ending to the concerns of families and children with autism.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="227385">We must look at it and make sure that the national strategy is going to ensure that children in this country who are affected by autism receive the type of treatment and therapy they need to ensure they have the highest quality of life possible, because many of us know that autism spectrum disorder is a very complex developmental disability, one that affects brain function. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227386">People with autism typically have an inability to talk and understand or communicate with others. They have an inability to form social relationships, to make eye contact, perhaps to recognize dangerous situations, as my colleague who spoke before me mentioned, an inability to adapt to changes in the environment or their routine, and perhaps an inability to learn skills and language naturally, as typically developing children do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227387">Autism spectrum disorder is currently reaching epidemic levels. If we look 10 years back, statistics show that almost one in every 10,000 children was diagnosed with autism. However, in 2006 the statistics are quite shocking. One in 166 children is diagnosed with autism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227388">As the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="78612" Type="2">Brampton—Springdale</Affiliation>, I have had the opportunity to meet with a number of parents and families with autistic children who live in my constituency. Hearing their stories is absolutely heart-wrenching. As was described earlier, many families who have autistic children, not only in my riding but across the country in many of the other provinces and territories, are actually having to mortgage their homes, sell their homes or give up their jobs to ensure that their children get the very best in treatment. Treatment costs have been estimated at almost $70,000 per year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227389"> We know there is effective treatment. I think that those of us in this House have a responsibility to ensure that the children who need that treatment actually get it. We must make these investments in their early childhood learning. We must ensure that they have the foundation to enable them to go out there and succeed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227390">Innovative research has shown us some effective treatment, such as intensive behavioural intervention, and there is also applied behaviour analysis, which actually breaks down into much more manageable steps many of the tasks these children face. Each newly achieved or mastered task then serves as a building block for these children to build on for future skills. These children are actually assisted or prompted, as some suggest, through this extremely positive therapeutic process. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227391">Right now in most provinces, intensive behavioural intervention and applied behaviour analysis are actually funded for preschool children. However, treatment depends on where one lives in the country. In some provinces, the treatment is funded until the age of six. As was mentioned earlier, in Alberta it is funded until the age of 18.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227392"> We must make sure that regardless of where one lives in Canada, whether it is on the west coast, the east coast or in the Northwest Territories, all children who are affected by autism actually have the opportunity to receive the treatment they need throughout their lives until the age of 18.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227393">I am sure this national strategy is going to ensure that we have the proper investment to do further research into whether there are other treatment options available and into how this type of condition can be prevented. We must invest in a comprehensive strategy to address this very complex disorder.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="20">(1420)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="227394">As I have mentioned, we know the cost is upwards of $70,000 per year, but we have to ensure we give the opportunity to these families so their children can obtain treatment and provide them with the quality of life they need. These families should be able to do this without having to mortgage their homes, or sell their cars, or go through those financial hardships. Many families that have been affected by autism simply cannot afford this treatment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227395">In April 2005 Justice Frances Kiteley of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice ruled that the absence of treatment for ABA meant that children with autism were excluded from the opportunity to access learning with the consequential deprivation of skills. The likelihood of this type of isolation from our society would result in the loss of the ability for these young children to exercise their rights and freedoms to which Canadians are entitled.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227396">Over the past 30 years, thousands of research documents have been published and have been peer-reviewed. These studies show that if these children receive the treatment they so much deserve, they will have a chance for purposeful and productive lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227397"> Many other constituents have come forward and have even sent out emails. I received another email just a few weeks back from a women in Manitoba. She talked about the fact that both of her sons were autistic. She described the hardship of having to sell her home to ensure that her children would get the type of care and treatment they needed. Today, her children are at the mercy of the school system because there is no legislation in Manitoba to ensure that these children receive the applied behaviour analysis treatment or the intensive behaviour intervention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227398">We all know that these children deserve better. They deserve the opportunity to go out there and learn. They deserve the opportunity to go out, become productive citizens and contribute to our social, economic and political fabric within our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227399">As a health care provider, I know the types of treatments these children receive have a very positive effect, not only for the families but also for those vulnerable children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227400">All members and all parties of the House have the opportunity to really make a difference for these families and these children. We have an opportunity to support a national autism strategy, which would make a tremendous difference in the lives of thousands of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227401">On behalf of our party, as the critic for health, we wholeheartedly support a national autism strategy. We commend the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="78349" Type="2">Fredericton</Affiliation> who has brought it forward. As was said earlier, this is a non-partisan issue that impacts thousands of families across the country. We need to have a strategy that will ensure we can further study this disorder, that we can have other effective treatment options come forward and that ensure those who require the care receive it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227402">On behalf of many members in my caucus of the Liberal Party, we fully and wholeheartedly support a creation of a national autism strategy for those thousands of young Canadians who are affected with autism. I hope we will have unanimous support in the House of Commons to adopt a national strategy on autism.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="78956" Type="18">Mr. Russ Hiebert (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="227403">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78349" Type="2">Fredericton</Affiliation> for bringing forward this motion which addresses this important issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227404">For those members who might not be familiar with autism spectrum disorders, I would like to take a moment to describe the challenges, difficulties and the problems that individuals with autism spectrum disorders and their families face.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227405">No one knows what causes spectrum disorders. Autism has been called by some experts arguably the most severe developmental disorder of childhood.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227406">Autism spectrum disorders occur in all cultures and all social classes. They occur more often in boys than in girls. Furthermore, autism spectrum disorders occur often alongside other disorders, most frequently developmental disabilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227407">It has been noted publicly that about three-quarters of autistic children have some degree of cognitive impairment. Between 60% and 80% of children with an autistic spectrum disorder function in the mild to severe range of mental retardation. What this means is that one person can have severe developmental disabilities and be mildly autistic, while another can be highly functioning intellectually but severely autistic. Of course, some will have severe difficulties both with respect to developmental difficulties and with respect to their autism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227408">How do autism spectrum disorders manifest themselves? Autism affects people in different ways, isolating its sufferers with compulsive behaviours and speech disorders that close people off from their family, friends, teachers, neighbours and society as a whole.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227409">Autism affects all aspects of the disabled person's life and if untreated results in physical, emotional, social and intellectual isolation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227410">Families of children with autism spectrum disorders have reported improved self-functioning, self-sufficiency and quality of life for the children when they are provided applied behavioural analysis or intensive behavioural intervention services, particularly at an early age, starting at age two. It is a painstaking, expensive treatment that requires full time individual therapy for children. Success stories exist with this treatment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227411">In one study, with an average of 40 hours per week of one on one treatment for two or more years, almost one-half of children recovered to the point of being indistinguishable from their normally developing peers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227412">What is the cost of this behaviour therapy? The cost for a year of therapy ranges between $50,000 and $120,000, depending on the severity of a child's condition. Since these therapy services are provided in the home and do not constitute traditional health services, many parents face significant financial burdens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227413">There is no doubt that a situation for which the treatments most likely to be beneficial cost tens of thousands of dollars can be a profound challenge on top of the challenges that autism spectrum disorders may bring in the first place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227414">There is also no doubt that autism spectrum disorders have an enormous effect on the family. As the parents of individuals with autistic spectrum disorders have attested, the impact on families is often devastating, both financially and emotionally. Families raising children with autism spectrum disorders face particular hardships, including financial hardships, time poverty and social isolation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227415">Parents of children with disabilities report that caring for a child with a disability affects their availability to work, requiring them often to work fewer hours, forgo promotions and adjust their work schedules entirely. In particular, the majority of mothers experience a negative impact on their employment. In addition, most parents of pre-school children with disabilities need, but do not have, additional support to carry out basic family responsibilities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227416">When we hear of the challenges facing families with a child who has been diagnosed as having an autism spectrum disorder, we can only be sympathetic. No one on either side of this House denies that families affected by autism face gaps in the services, especially the social services that can be used to address the needs of their children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227417">It is not surprising to me that people in the autism community, parents and supporters of many kinds, have been so active in seeking action on autism spectrum disorders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227418">We recognize that national action on autism spectrum disorders would require cooperation between levels of government. Health and social services are clearly under provincial jurisdiction. The finance minister announced in budget 2006 numerous measures that we are using to assist families with disabilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="227419">I believe that we are all sympathetic to the situation facing families with children who have been diagnosed as having an autism spectrum disorder. I would like to take this--</ParaText>
