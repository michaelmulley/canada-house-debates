Despite his retirement from politics, Mr. Roux was still committed to the region through chairing local organizations such as the Fondation Hôtel-Dieu d'Arthabaska.

              <ParaText id="1259304">As an MP for Skeena for 14 years, Jim was, at times, outrageous but always fearless. He was a big and early supporter of first nations rights and, as a natural extension, the protection of our planet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259305"> In all the epic struggles, laughter was never far from Jim. After raging on some poor minister of the Crown he would cross the floor, share an inappropriate joke and soon be picking up the tab at the local pub. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1259323">Mr. Speaker, 61 years ago, the people of Quebec decided to make a statement by adopting a national flag. Since then, Quebec has asserted, loudly and clearly, that it is not part of another nation, but a nation unto itself, and has conducted itself accordingly. The people of Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot can proudly lay claim to the origins of our national flag, which was inspired in part by the flag that Father Filiatrault, parish priest at Saint-Jude, hoisted above his presbytery in 1902. That flag bore white fleur-de-lis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259324">Our national flag symbolizes the glorious past and bright future of a people ready, determined, steadfast, and resolutely looking to the future.

              <ParaText id="1259326">Bullying has changed over the years. While there are still bullies in the schoolyards, advances such as the Internet and text messaging allow bullying to happen anytime, anywhere, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</ParaText>

This effectively wipes out any Conservative progress on reducing the federal debt. How can Canadians have confidence in the government when the Conservatives took over a $13 billion surplus from the Liberals in 2005 and simply blew it? Why should Canadians trust the Conservatives to weather this recession when they could not manage in a healthy economy?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1259569">The bill is based on the premise that Canada recognizes the fundamental rights of workers, including their right to be free from unhealthy and unsafe working conditions within our country. We want to extend the recognition of that right to the activities of Canadian companies when acting abroad. In other words, we believe a majority of Canadians want Canadian corporations to meet the same minimum health and safety standards for their employees abroad as they do in this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259570">We point to the precedent that the Criminal Code currently contains a provision aimed at protecting children in other countries from Canadian sexual predators.

This enactment would amend the Old Age Security Act to allow eligible pensioners to receive the guaranteed income supplement without having to apply for it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259579">We were shocked to learn recently that hundreds of thousands of Canadians who are eligible to receive the guaranteed income supplement are not receiving it because they have not proactively filled out the forms and made application to receive it. We argue that the Government of Canada knows who these people are by virtue of their income tax records. They should simply be allocated the guaranteed income supplement when they become eligible by virtue of their income in the preceding year. This would address the issues of literacy and mobility that may prevent eligible people from making that application and would put that much needed guaranteed income supplement into the hands of people who need it most without delay, interference or any duty or obligation on their part.</ParaText>

Pensions are on the mind of many Canadians and this particular enactment would provide further protection of the assets of pension plan members and beneficiaries by three important measures: first, to ensure that members have adequate representation on the boards of trustees of pensions, pension committees and pension councils; in other words, mandatory representation of the employee and the beneficiaries of the plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259591"> Second, it would provide that not more than 10% of the total value of the assets of a pension plan could be held in securities issued by the employer or by a corporation associated with the employer. This is a lesson learned from Enron where employees were strongly encouraged to invest all of their retirement savings in a company they worked for, with all their eggs in one basket, and the results, as we know, were catastrophic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259592">Third, it would prevent pension plan administrators and beneficiaries from being restricted in the sale of the employer's securities unless those directors and officers of the employer are similarly restricted. In other words, the beneficiary administrators are not allowed to promote the sale of the employer's own stock unless there is some distance put in between them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259593">Finally, the bill would require that information that affects or is likely to affect the value of securities be provided to pension plan administrators and to persons with the power to trade in those securities at the same time that it is provided to anyone other than the directors, officers, management and advisers of the employer to stop the difficult situation of insider trading.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259594">We believe anything to do with adding to the security of pension plans is necessary and timely in this session of this Parliament and we encourage unanimous support of the legislation and we hope we can find it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1259615">The petition is premised on the investigation by CTV's <I>W-FIVE</I> which raised serious questions about the Department of Citizenship and Immigration's handling of Gideon McGuire Auger's application for Canadian citizenship. It would appear that the ministry did not act with due diligence in investigating background information before granting citizenship to Mr. Auger and the integrity of Canada's entire citizenship process has been called into question. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259616">The former minister of Citizenship and Immigration promised to investigate the handling of Mr. Auger's file and the petitioners are anxious to learn about the findings of that investigation and seek assurance from the government that the findings will be acted on forthwith by the minister.</ParaText>

Today I have a petition on the same theme signed by 1,650 Canadians who are very concerned about the government's intentions to reintroduce legislation, supposedly in the name of protecting consumers from unsafe drugs and products, while in fact decreasing accessibility to natural health products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259618">The petitioners call on the government to reassess this legislation in light of serious flaws identified with this bill, particularly when it comes to natural health products, but also considering the fact that the bill may not do the job that is required with respect to pharmaceuticals that are now on the market or being considered for the marketplace. There are serious concerns by the petitioners that the bill may actually reintroduce a system of progressive licensing which may deny serious surveillance at the post-market end of the process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259619">The petitioners urge the government to prevent anyone in the government from reintroducing Bill <Document DbId="3387909" Type="3">C-51</Document> and bringing forward a much more sensible package that will protect consumers.</ParaText>

They point out that last year more people died from asbestos than from all other industrial causes combined, and that Canada allows the exporting of 200,000 tonnes of asbestos per year into third world and underdeveloped nations. They also point out that Canada spends millions of dollars subsidizing the asbestos industry and even blocks international efforts to curb its use by other countries. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1259658">As a result of the global recession, we expect the Canadian economy to contract by 0.8% over the next year. This means that tax revenues will decrease. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259659">At the same time, we will need to spend more to protect our economy and help Canadians hit hardest by the global recession. This in turn means that a temporary deficit cannot be avoided. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1259667">In spite of these temporary deficits, by the end of our program our total government net debt as a share of the economy will still be the lowest in the G7, by a wide margin.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1259676">Canada's economic action plan provides immediate benefits, especially to low- and middle-income Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259677">Effective January 1, 2009, we will increase the basic personal amount. This means that a greater portion of Canadians' earnings will not be subject to federal income tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259678">Effective January 1, 2009, we will also increase the upper limit of the two lowest personal income tax brackets. This means that a greater proportion of Canadians' earnings will be taxed at a lower rate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259679">We will increase the amount that families could earn while still receiving the national child benefit supplement and the Canada child tax benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259680">As a result of these changes, a single parent with two children earning $35,000 will be ahead $500 per year. A two-income couple with two children earning $70,000 will be ahead $275 per year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259681">The tax relief would help low- and middle-income Canadians and it will stimulate consumer spending. This in turn will help stimulate our entire economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259682">To provide additional help to low-income Canadians, we will also increase the working income tax benefit, or WITB. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259683">Many low-income Canadians, especially those receiving social assistance, would like to take a job, but they face disincentives, in the form of higher taxes and reduced benefits. The WITB supplements the earnings of low-income workers to help ensure they are better off by taking a job. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259684">Our increase to the WITB will effectively double the tax relief that this measure provides. We expect that for the 2009 tax year more than 1.5 million individuals and families, many of them single women with children, will benefit as a result.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259685">In Canada's economic action plan, we will also provide further tax relief for Canadian seniors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259686">We will increase the age credit amount by an additional $1,000 dollars. This will provide each eligible senior additional savings of up to $150 per year. However, more is needed to help our seniors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259687">The global financial crisis has caused them added worry, as they see the effect on their retirement savings. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259688">To provide some relief, we will reduce the amount seniors are required to withdraw from their RRIFs, by 25% for 2008. This will provide one-time tax relief of $200 million for Canadian seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259689">The personal income tax relief in Canada's economic action plan will put more money in the hands of Canadian families. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259690">Most important, this year and over the next five years these measures will inject approximately $20 billion in stimulus into the Canadian economy.</ParaText>

For the Canadian economy, the home construction and home renovation industries are major sources of jobs and growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259696">First, to encourage home ownership and home construction, we will increase the amount first-time home buyers can withdraw from their RRSPs to purchase or build a new home from $20,000 to $25,000. We will also establish a first-time home buyers tax credit, saving Canadians up to $750 in closing costs in buying a new home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259697"> To stimulate spending and to help Canadians invest in the long-term value of their homes, we will provide a temporary home renovation tax credit. Effective tomorrow and extending until January 31, 2010, this measure will provide tax relief for home renovation costs, saving Canadian families up to $1,350 on their 2009 taxes. The home renovation tax credit is available for renovations to the house or the cottage, for everything from a new furnace to energy efficient windows to a new deck. It may be claimed in addition to support from the existing eco-energy retrofit program and the medical expense tax credit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259698">These measures to support home construction and renovation will help stimulate our construction and building supplies industries. This in turn will support forestry and other Canadian industries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259699"> The tax relief provided in Canada's economic action plan will encourage long-term economic growth. It will help working families to manage the effects of the recession. It will give an immediate boost to our economy and help to create jobs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1259706">Beyond this, we need to help Canadians who are out of work to find new, good jobs. For that, we need to increase our investment in skills development. In Canada's economic action plan we will provide new opportunities for short and long-term skills upgrading. This will include targeted programs for apprentices and older workers, additional support for skills development and training for aboriginal Canadians and new investments to create job opportunities for aboriginal Canadians.

The global recession has affected not only families, but also Canadian businesses. Many Canadian businesses are in a relatively strong position, compared to their foreign competitors. As a result of our government’s actions, by 2010 Canada will have the lowest overall tax rate on new business investment in the G7. But Canadians have agreed that we need to do more. We need to do more to encourage long-term growth. We need to help sustain Canadian jobs and to help all Canadian businesses to weather the current storm.</ParaText>

These are industries upon which hundreds of thousands of Canadian families depend for their livelihood, upon which many communities and regions depend for their vitality. To help meet this challenge in Canada's economic action plan, we are creating a two year $1 billion community adjustment fund. The fund will support economic diversification in communities affected by distress or decline in their local industries. This will help communities across Canada facing unique challenges, from the mountain pine beetle infestation to the declining global demand for seafood.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1259718">We will increase funding available to the regional development bodies for Atlantic Canada, Quebec and western Canada. For the first time, we will provide support for regional economic development across the province of Ontario. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1259722">To continue growing and creating jobs, Canadian businesses need to be free to invest. In our last two budgets our government temporarily accelerated the accelerated capital cost allowance treatment of investments in machinery and equipment.

The global financial crisis requires that we take further action to support Canadian families and businesses. The crisis in the United States financial system has sent shock waves around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259728">Canadian financial institutions have been less willing to lend. Families with a good credit history find it difficult to get a lease for a new car. Well run businesses find it harder to finance the purchase of new machinery. This shortage of financing can make a difficult economic situation much worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259729">Our government took action to increase access to financing when the global crisis emerged in the fall. Because the situation has continued to deteriorate, our government is taking additional action. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259730">In Canada's economic action plan we will build on our previous measures to increase access to financing. We will make available to Canadian businesses up to $200 billion in liquidity and financing to keep our economy moving. This new extraordinary financing framework will have several components. We will extend the insured mortgage purchase program through the first half of the next fiscal year to encourage private sector financial institutions to increase lending. We will also establish a new Canadian secured credit facility to help consumers and businesses in financing the purchase of vehicles and equipment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259731">In November, our government committed additional capital to our financial crown corporations: Export Development Canada and the Business Development Bank of Canada. EDC and BDC are key sources of financing for the small and medium size businesses which create so many of Canada's new jobs. They can now leverage this additional capital into billions of dollars of new lending ability. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259732">In Canada's economic action plan our government will build on this success through the business credit availability program. This new program will give EDC and BDC greater lending powers. It will also encourage partnerships between the public and private sector financial institutions to ensure that credit-worthy borrowers can get access to financing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259733">We also will provide additional support for Canadian small businesses by expanding the Canada small business financing program and we will give greater flexibility to the Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation to enhance its role in safeguarding the stability of Canada's financial system.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1259788">Mr. Speaker, in this time of economic crisis, we expected the federal government to consider the needs expressed by the people of Quebec and their elected representatives. In anticipation of this budget, Quebec was very clear about its needs, and the National Assembly unanimously adopted a motion in that regard. The Bloc Québécois acted responsibly by presenting a detailed, costed, realistic plan last November. Our plan addresses major points of consensus in Quebec, and our role is to stand up for those points here in Ottawa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259789">The Conservative government decided not to take Quebec's demands into consideration. Moreover, instead of helping Quebec, the government decided to deny it the tools it needs to face the crisis. Instead, the Conservative leader decided to give in to the demands of Ontario and the west. For example, the government has put forward nearly $4 billion worth of measures chiefly benefiting Ontario. The auto sector—which is concentrated in Ontario—will receive $2.7 billion. Southern Ontario will receive a billion dollars, which happens to be the amount deducted from Quebec's equalization payments. The manufacturing sector will get nothing but crumbs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259790">I would like to ask the minister what happened to the Conservative government's supposed openness to Quebec and Quebeckers, who also have to make it through this crisis?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1259792">With respect to the question of transfers, this budget is rather different than what went on in the 1990s. What we have done is not reduced transfers to the provinces. We are maintaining the health transfer increase at 6%. We are maintaining the CST at 3%. We are not imposing on the provinces in terms of health or education because in a time of recession they need to maintain those services. Those services and the federal contributions are being maintained.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1259793">Mr. Speaker, for a week now government ministers have leaked budget proposals and said “trust us”. Today's budget just proved that they cannot be trusted to deliver.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259794">In this economy, when workers are worried about losing their jobs, the government just announced that it prioritized $60 billion in corporate tax cuts and it found only $1.15 billion for the unemployed. Clearly, the leopard could not change its spots. This government still cannot be trusted to act on the concerns of hard-working Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259795">Let us look at it in more detail. This budget fails to reform employment insurance; it does not freeze weekly rates; it maintains the two-week waiting period; and it does not improve eligibility requirements. There is absolutely no commitment to child care spaces. This budget maintains the attack on women's rights to pursue pay equity complaints. There are absolutely no initiatives for veterans or seniors by increasing old age security. Infrastructure commitments remain out of reach for most municipalities that simply cannot match the funds. There is absolutely no strategy for a green car industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259796">Yes, this government is full of rhetoric, but rhetoric is not real change and Canadians deserve better.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1259798">Mr. Speaker, we conducted one of the most extensive broad consultations in the history of Canada in the preparation of this budget. The measures in the budget that relate to employment insurance are what we were told was necessary by Canadians from coast to coast to coast: to extend benefits and, most important, to ensure that retraining is available and to make sure that work sharing is available, so that as we go through this difficult time together as Canadians we will take care of those Canadians who will be moving into new industries. We want to ensure they get the training they need in order to accomplish that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1259799">That is what we can do for our fellow Canadians, including WITB, the working income tax benefit, which I certainly hope the member opposite would support because it helps the poorest people in our society get a job.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1259804">Canada's economic action plan does include the home renovation tax credit. This will benefit about 4.6 million Canadian families and individuals performing home renovations. Eligible renovation costs could include planting trees, installing a new energy efficient furnace or water heater, finishing a basement, remodelling a kitchen or resurfacing a driveway. Expenses eligible for the credit will include permits, professional services, equipment rentals and incidental expenses. Most important, this tax credit will result in a significant immediate stimulus to the Canadian economy, helping employ Canadians, helping our retail sector, and helping the forestry industry as well.</ParaText>
