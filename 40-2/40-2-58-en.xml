              <ParaText id="1475724">He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce my private member's bill to ban the use of replacement workers and maintain essential services in the public service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475725">I have heard the criticisms levelled by the other parties, including the Liberal Party, regarding the various anti-scab bills introduced in this House. It is important to understand that, for Quebec, and in fact for the rest of Canada, this would improve the Canada Labour Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475726">Thousands of employees who work in banks, at ports and airports, and for telephone and telecommunications companies come under the Canada Labour Code and do not have the benefit of anti-scab legislation. As I have explained, the bill aims to ban replacement workers while maintaining essential services in the public service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475727">Quebec's experience has clearly shown that provisions banning the use of replacement workers by far the best solution for all parties involved in a labour dispute. Not only does the use of replacement workers encourage violence, but it often leaves deep scars that poison the work environment after disputes are resolved. In Quebec, under the current law, the number of person-days lost as a result of labour disputes has gone down considerably and is well below the Canadian average.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475728">I therefore ask my colleagues to vote in favour of this bill when the time comes.</ParaText>

Not only does integration of these new instruments and principles into federal law guarantee higher compensation to victims of marine accidents, but it will also have positive repercussions on the Canadian compensation fund. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475759">Withdrawing the prohibition for adventure tourism activities to use waivers in order to be exonerated of civil responsibilities toward their passengers is a good thing for us as well. By their very nature, these activities involve a degree of risk that participants must assume. Although this change may at first glance seem to be sufficient, it will be necessary to evaluate its repercussions in committee. The creation of a maritime lien for Canadian ship suppliers against foreign vessels was equally desirable, but again it is essential that it be studied in committee because that will make it possible to determine the scope of this addition and to suggest improvements to it as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475760">I will close by stating that the Bloc Québécois is in favour of this bill. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1475763"> I am not a member of the transport committee but I have attended four different meetings. I was a substitute at the first meeting and I noted a serious problem in the legislation, so I came back for three other meetings to see if we could fix it. I proposed amendments specifically with respect to this maritime lien and those amendments were discussed on May 7. I am disappointed to say that the government voted against them so I am here today to explain the situation and ask the Conservatives to reconsider them. However, at a minimum, Canadians need to know that they voted against these proposed amendments and why they did.</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475768">It is a lot of language but, in short, it means that if a foreign vessel comes into Canada and a person supplies services to it, the person has a right to get paid and attempt to exercise that right against the actual ship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475769">The next question is whether this right actually does anything for the person. The problem is that it does not because, in most circumstances, that right would be meaningless. Although the person would have the right to get payment, how would the person actually do it because, generally speaking, people will have extreme difficulty trying to get the money?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475770">We need to look at this on a very practical basis. If people are owed $200, $500, $2,000 or whatever it may be, how will they get their money? Although this proposed maritime lien would give people the right to try to get the money, what do they need to do? With the way the current system is written, which has a gap in terms of the remedy, people must sue. Therefore, if there is a foreign vessel in a port that owes people money and it is about to leave, there is nothing people can do about it. If it is from a foreign country, people will need to hire a lawyer and try to sue somewhere even if a judge will accept jurisdiction in a foreign country. This is not a practical right because there is no way to exercise this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475771">Even if the ship were to remain in Canada, people would need to hire a lawyer, which means money. Whatever the bill may be, whether it is $400, $500, $800 or more, people need to hire a lawyer in order to sue, pay a filing fee and then try to get an order to stop the ship or sell the ship in order to get their money. People would then need to prepare motion material, which means a notice of motion, an affidavit or two and a documentation order, that is assuming they could even find a lawyer who can get it into court. Even if they do find a lawyer who can get into court, they then have to wait. It could be a number of hours and the lawyers charge by the hour. Assuming they could even find a lawyer and even find a judge, they may end up spending a few thousand dollars trying to enforce a debt of a few hundred dollars that is owed. People will not do it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475772"> Once again, I am not on this committee but I kept coming back because I thought this would be better for Canadians. Sections 128 and 129 already have a provision for a designated officer to direct a ship to stop and to issue a detention order if it looks like something untoward has occurred. What that would really mean is that some problems would be solved. First, a ship escaping or leaving Canada would be stopped. Once it is here it would not be able to go anywhere, which means we are preserving that right and that lien. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1475773">Second, if a detention order were issued, part of it would say that the foreign vessel must pay a certain amount of money before it could be released. It just keeps the status quo. It keeps it there. The owner can pay the money and go or go in front of a judge, which puts the onus on the foreign vessel owner to actually do something. At least Canadians would be protected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475774">With the amendments that I proposed, which I am disappointed to say that the Conservatives voted against, ships would be kept in Canada and they would either have to pay or go before a judge. That would skip the first layer of having to actually hire a lawyer and spend all that money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475775">The Canadian Bar Association had a representative who said that he was opposed to these amendments. I understand that because I am the former secretary of the Ontario Bar Association representing approximately 17,000 lawyers. The job of the Ontario Bar Association and the Canadian Bar Association is to represent lawyers. I am particularly disappointed with the parliamentary secretary, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128667" Type="2">Fort McMurray—Athabasca</Affiliation>, who is also a lawyer. He said that he knows how a court works, and I believe him, but he was supporting lawyers. In essence, he said, “You can hire a lawyer, you can pay a lawyer and you can get into court and we'll leave things the way they are”. That means that people who cannot afford a lawyer or people who have very small claims will not have any fair redress. I am very disappointed with that because our job is not to represent a particular constituency group, but Canadians in general. Although I am lawyer, I am here to represent the people of <Affiliation DbId="128874" Type="2">Brampton West</Affiliation> and Canadians. I am very disappointed with the government for this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475776"> I would like to read some specific quotes by the parliamentary secretary when he was at the committee on Thursday, May 7. The <Affiliation DbId="128850" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport, Infrastructure </Affiliation> gave examples and said, “You've got a large, expensive ship...with a small bill, whatever it may be, owed to Canadians, and I just don't see that as being appropriate”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475777">In essence, he was siding with the foreign vessels and with the lawyers over Canadian citizens who may be owed money but, for some unfair reason, the foreign vessel has refused to pay them. I do not see that as appropriate for a member of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475778">A second quote by the parliamentary secretary reads, “I believe lawyers can be called on a phone--I know I was available most nights until midnight--and can do a lien and find a judge in time to do it, even after hours”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475779">What he is saying is that we will not be changing the system, we will not be making it better for Canadians and constituents. We will keep it with lawyers. We will keep this as an expensive system even though the amounts in question are so small that either people will not bother and, therefore, will be treated unfairly, or they will not be able to afford to exercise their right. I find that quite disappointing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475780">The legal counsel for the Department of Transport acknowledges that this change would be something that would be added to the legislation. He says that it would be an element to the way in which a maritime lien is enforced and a positive step to help Canadians and our fellow constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475781">Despite that comment, the parliamentary secretary and the government, for whatever reason, just voted against all of this to defeat what I think would be a very positive change for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475782">Although this may seem complicated, it is not. It is as simple as this. There is a new right, a maritime lien under clause 139. There would be no way to practically use this unless there is a substantive change. It just would not happen on an everyday practical basis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475783">I proposed a substantive amendment that would create a remedy so Canadians could enforce and use this maritime lien. It would help Canadians, who we should be focusing on, and innocent service providers, not advocacy groups, such as the owners of foreign vessels or lawyers. There is nothing wrong with lawyers making a decent living but we can cut out the first step for the benefit of Canadians and still require a court as a second step. This would save money and protect the rights of Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1475785">As he said, his suggestions were turned down by the government even though virtually all of the representatives who came forward said that the rights of Canadians could be protected if we could have a minor amendment linking the vessel owners in a contractual arrangement with those who were utilizing the vessel for purposes of commerce. They do not necessarily need to be the same individual. However, as long as there could be a contractual connection, then we might not need those amendments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475786">I am wondering whether the member for <Affiliation DbId="128874" Type="2">Brampton West</Affiliation> would clarify that for us, because the government accepted neither of those positions.

The average person will not be able to use it or will choose not to use it because the amounts of money that we are talking about, generally speaking, that Canadians will seek to go after are quite small in relation to what they will need to pay a lawyer. On a practical basis, they may not even have the opportunity because these vessels may leave Canada. Some may come back and some may not come back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475789">I believe that to make this maritime lien an actual right that will work, we need to do more. Why put it in there if it is not going to work?

              <ParaText id="1475794">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in favour of Bill <Document DbId="3630955" Type="3">C-7</Document>, which represents some badly needed updates to the Marine Liability Act. These updates are essential in an age when Canada's waterways are becoming some of the most hotly contested in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475795">Whether it concerns land, sea or air, the world has undergone a revolution over the past 20 years with regard to making polluters pay.

              <ParaText id="1475796">Bill <Document DbId="3630955" Type="3">C-7</Document> would bring Canada into line with several international conventions that have come into effect in recent years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475797">In British Columbia the threat of accidents occurring as a result of oil tanker traffic is always of great concern.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475798"> In terms of oil spills, the <I>Exxon Valdez</I> disaster will remain in our minds forever. It spilled 41 million litres of oil, one-sixth of the oil it carried, and polluted 2,000 kilometres of coastline. Hundreds of thousands of birds, fish and animals died right away, including somewhere between 250,000 and 500,000 seabirds, thousands of sea otters, hundreds of harbour seals and bald eagles, a couple of dozen killer whales, and a dozen or more river otters. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475799">Over the past two years there has been furious discussion in my home province about the validity of the federal government's statement dating back to the early 1970s in regard to a moratorium on oil tanker traffic along the B.C. coast. While I am not going to delve into that particular debate in my speech today, I am going to try to point out that we as a country must be better prepared to mitigate any future incidents should they occur. With this in mind, I am pleased that the first convention this bill would ratify is the Protocol of 2003 to the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage, 1992.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475800">More specifically, this change to the act would provide an additional tier of compensation for damages resulting from the spill of persistent oil, mainly crude oil, from tankers from about $405 million to $1.5 billion per incident. In citing this provision, let me attempt to properly convey the sensitive nature of British Columbia's fragile and pristine coastal areas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475801">According to Statistics Canada, the total cargo handled at Canadian ports and marinas in 2006 was 466.3 million tonnes. The domestic tonnage handled in 2006 represented 136.2 tonnes. What must also be noted is that these figures do not include vessels that are used for recreation, tourism, or purposes other than cargo transport.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475802">This leads me into the next provision of the bill that is extremely important for British Columbia, namely, the exemption of liability for the marine adventure tourism industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475803">Before I talk about this industry and its growth potential, I want to point out one simple fact. All marine adventure tourism operators are required to have a minimum of $1 million in liability insurance, and a certificate of insurance must be delivered prior to a license being issued. This requirement alone is reason enough for operators to be exempted from part 4 of the act. Combine this with the fact that waivers are a standard practice for water-based adventure tourism activities that are inherently fraught with danger, and there are enough guarantees in place to ensure safety associated with that industry.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="35">(1035)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1475804">Operators cannot always be at risk of frivolous claims, particularly with activities where one of the main attractions is the risk involved. The fact is that the west coast of British Columbia provides an unparalleled setting for ecotourism, adventure travel, nature tourism or sustainable tourism. These are currently the fastest growing segments of the tourism industry on the west coast. They present risks, but they also create jobs in British Columbia. By current projections, the estimates for anticipated labour demand in the area of adventure tourism and recreation will be 13,100 workers by 2015. This is nothing to scoff at. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475805">This bill is an indication that Ottawa understands the unique nature and characteristics of operators within marine adventure tourism. This is a substantive bill. Although I have only had time to touch upon a couple of main issues, I would like to make a couple of salient points to conclude.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475806">Bill <Document DbId="3630955" Type="3">C-7</Document> represents the culmination of many years of important work that parliamentarians on all sides of the House have engaged in. It is very specific in its amendments to the Marine Liability Act and therefore is very limited in the kind of attention it might garner. However, these are the kinds of amendments that can make industries more globally competitive and more important, protect Canadians from dangers that often only become apparent when it is too late. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475807">This is an important bill. It has been a privilege to stand today to articulate my support for it.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1475820">Mr. Speaker, it is a real pleasure to speak on this issue. My friend and colleague who just spoke very clearly mentioned some of the challenges we have, and as British Columbians, these challenges are in our neighbourhoods. They are next to our homes and affect the livelihood of the people who live and work in our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475821">Our nation, though, is very blessed. We have 5.87 million square kilometres of marine areas, one of the largest marine areas in the entire world. This is our legacy. This is what we have been given, and we are the stewards and responsible for managing this not only for our country but indeed for the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475822">As we know, ecosystems are connected. They go beyond borders. The complex ecosystems and environmental systems in our country are connected to a global ecosystem. We have, as the saying goes, only one world, so it is up to us to be able to do the right things for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475823">The challenges affecting our oceans are significant: global warming, pollution and the biocumulation of toxins. In fact, in British Columbia, whales such as orcas, and indeed, on the east coast, if a beluga whale were to wash up in the St. Lawrence River, that beluga whale would be considered to be toxic material, because the biocumulation of toxic materials in high-level marine mammals is a deep concern.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475824">We also think, with respect to why the orca population on the west coast may have flatlined and is declining, it is because the accumulation of these biotoxins is actually having a negative impact on the ability of these large and beautiful mammals to reproduce.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475825">We have the issue of oil spills, as I mentioned before, and ships, people, fractured storm drainage systems, which is happening in Victoria now, and logging practices. In my area, we have seen logging that has gone right down to the level of the rivers. What that is doing, in violating existing laws, is actually destroying the ability of these rivers to produce the salmon that so many British Columbians live on. As a result of that, the lack of enforcement is allowing the destruction of the very salmon beds that are integral to our ability to have a fisheries industry that is sustainable and growing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475826">On the issue of overfishing, 90% of the commercial fish species in the world are either at their limit or being overfished, which means they are in decline—for example, tuna and marlin. We saw what happened with the northern cod on the east coast of Canada. The fish species that the world consumes right now are being fished at such a level and at such a rate, in such an irresponsible way, that they cannot survive. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475827">What will the impact be on our ability to eat fish? It is going to severely compromise it, not only for Canadians, but around the world in developing countries where the consumption of fish is one of the most inexpensive and most accessible, historically, sources of protein. Without the protein, people's lives are going to be affected from a health perspective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475828">Different fishing practices that exist now, I would say personally, should be banned. Why do we allow dragging? Why do we allow fishermen to drag the bottom of areas, which destroys the ability of fish to reproduce? The act of dragging is actually reducing and damaging the very places these fish reproduce. The goal we must have, in my view, is to create a network of marine protected areas. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475829">In British Columbia, we have some marine protected areas, but the level of marine protected areas we have now is inadequate. These must be based on ecosystem management systems and sustainable fisheries practices. If we are able to do this, we will indeed be able to have the marine protected areas that are required.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475830">As the basis of this, the marine protected areas must be founded on the sound principle of the combination--</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1475835">Mr. Speaker, thank you for doing that. I appreciate that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475836">Alanna Mitchell, who we hosted as part of the international conservation caucus a few weeks ago, is a former <I>Globe and Mail</I> reporter. She has published a book called <I>Sea Sick</I>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475837">In this book, she eloquently and articulately speaks about the damage taking place within our oceans, not only the oceans in other parts of the world but also the oceans that abut our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475838">I recommend that people take a look at this book, because in it she describes the impact of the different pressures I mentioned before. One thing I would like to reiterate, and she says it very clearly, is that if the sea life disappears, the life on land will disappear, too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475839">This point is a fundamental principle that we must adhere to and that we must remember, because if we do not do something to deal with the destruction of sea life right now, then what we are going to see is that it will negatively affect life on land, and there is no going back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475840">How this is happening through global warming is as follows.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475841"> As the temperature is rising, as we are increasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, what we are seeing is a meltdown. In the Arctic, where my colleague from the <Affiliation DbId="128784" Type="2">Yukon</Affiliation> lives and has spoken very eloquently about this, the melting of the polar ice cap is actually also causing a melting of the permafrost. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475842"> The permafrost contains methane. Methane is a greenhouse gas that is 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. With this release of this methane, the methane is going up into the atmosphere and exacerbating global warming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475843">That is acidifying the oceans. The pH is going down. This is negatively affecting the life in the oceans, particularly the small creatures that form the basis of the food chain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475844">What we are seeing when that happens is a downstream domino effect on the rest of the food chain, affecting larger and larger species. So the commercial fish species that we consume and the fish that others consume are in decline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475845">One example I want to bring up, and I hope that the <Affiliation DbId="128695" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation> at some time would like to pay attention to this, is that there are very small fish up in the Arctic that are absolutely essential for the ecosystems in the Arctic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475846"> These small fish are about to be harvested in an unregulated fashion by Norway. Norway is going to go up into our Arctic regions and harvest these fish, which are the basis of the food chain in the Arctic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475847">I would implore the <Affiliation DbId="128695" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation> to go and deal with Norway and develop a regime to make sure that we are not going to have an unregulated fishery in the Arctic that is going to have a cataclysmic effect on the Canadians who live in the Arctic. This is a very serious problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475848">The other issue I want to bring up that the government could pursue is the state of the marine protected areas we have on the west coast and the need for other marine protected areas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475849">Right now with the collapsing fish stocks that we are seeing and the dead zones that are occurring, it is more important than ever for us to have these marine protected areas that are forming a contiguous area. As to some of the principles in applying for this, I know the IUCN and CPAWS have done a good job of identifying specific areas that need to be protected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475850">I would ask the minister to really listen to the WWF, CPAWS and the IUCN, and to take a look at those areas that they have identified as being critically important. They are important because they are crucial areas for different species of marine life in the sea. The removal and the absence of those areas is going to have a cataclysmic effect on the fish species there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475851">Right now, we have 59 conservation areas, covering some 3,020 square kilometres, that have been established throughout the region. This is a small fraction. In fact, only 1% of the areas that exist on the west coast are actually protected. There are other areas that have to be protected, and they have been identified.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475852">I would just ask again that the government really listen to the NGO organizations that have identified these areas. If we do not do this now, those areas are going to be destroyed and the expansion of dead zones are going to continue in the ocean, which is going to negatively affect the communities that live in the coastal regions and are dependent on those areas.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="55">(1055)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1475853">One particularly unique species that we have on the west coast is glass sponges. They have survived 9,000 years, but right now, more than half of these glass sponges have been destroyed. They are, in effect, living dinosaurs. These areas should be protected because they are critically important in many ways for the larger submarine habitats that exist in the cold waters off the coast of British Columbia. If we fail to do this, these sponges will never come back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475854">The whale species, which are a signature species on the west coast, are in decline. This is a global problem. British Columbians are very attached to the orca killer whales. As I said, we have seen the numbers flatline and decline in some of the subspecies of orcas on the west coast of British Columbia. As a result we can see that these species can actually disappear. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475855">Of course, the other issue is seabirds. Seabirds are a sentinel species. On the west coast of Canada, we have had a decline of these species, in part because of dumping into the ocean.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475856">I want to get into the issue of dumping pollution into our oceans. In Victoria, we have a very particular issue having to do with sewage treatment. There is a demand on the part of the federal government to force Victoria to have a secondary plus level of sewage treatment. Unfortunately, this proposal, which is now estimated to cost $2 billion, is going to be the largest boondoggle in Canadian history. I will explain why it is not necessary and what should be done to address the environmental concerns that Victorians have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475857">I spoken with members of the Ministry of the Environment and they think we are simply dumping raw sewage into the ocean or into Victoria Harbour. That is absolutely not the truth. The fact of the matter is, though it is going into toilets and sinks, it is actually sieved so that nothing larger than four millimetres actually gets out the other end. In fact, the area around the outfalls in Victoria is not damaged. The area immediately around it has some effects, but more than 100 to 200 metres outside, there is no effect. In fact, those areas have some of the best fishing around, and fisherman will agree with that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475858">What comes out of the outfalls in Victoria is 99.9% water. Many of the bad things, such as the heavy metals, lead, mercury and pharmaceuticals that are of concern, are controlled by source control. They are not really dumped down. Even if they are dumped down, a secondary plus treatment system will not deal with this problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475859">The major source of marine pollution taking place right now in Victoria is coming from the fractured storm drainage system. The detritus that Victorians see on the side of the ocean at times, particularly after a storm, is not a result of the outfall. The root cause of that is a fractured storm drainage system that is more than 80 years old, in many cases. That stuff is leaking into the environment. That is bad. It needs to be fixed, but it is not part of the mandate of what the federal government has asked Victoria to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475860">In other words, the federal government is chasing a $2 billion boondoggle that is not going to affect the environmental needs of my community. This will be an irresponsible use of the taxpayers' money. If the minister wants to affect positively the environmental needs of my community of Victoria, wants to improve the marine life and decrease pollution in our oceans, he needs to do the following.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475861">First, do not pursue this $2 billion sewage treatment boondoggle proposal. Second, put the funds into the repair of the storm drainage system. Third, have a better source control system. We already have a good one, but it can be improved somewhat. If we do that, the marine environments around Victoria will be addressed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475862">He can also pursue the enforcement rules that are necessary to ensure that dumping of garbage into the oceans is not going to continue. Much of the garbage that we see floating around does not come from an outfall. It actually comes from ships dumping raw garbage into the oceans. It comes from people dumping garbage into the oceans right where they live. That is the cause of the problem.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="00">(1100)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1475863">I would try to save the taxpayer $2 million, but the government is marching down a road it will regret. The proposal I am giving can be found on www.rstv.ca. It is backed by more than 10 environmental ocean scientists at the University of Victoria and more than six chief public health medical officers in Victoria. We are all on the same side, a side that is different from the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475864">The government should look at the United States, where certain communities actually received an exemption. They have the same type of unique ecosystem as we do with the deep ocean currents and the cold water. They were able to take the essentially organic matter coming out of the outfall and use it for what it should be, which is food for marine life in our oceans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475865">On another matter, the issue of fishing, I would ask the <Affiliation DbId="128695" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation> to work with his counterpart, the <Affiliation DbId="128709" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries and Oceans</Affiliation>. There is a deep rot within the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. There is an inability of the department to deal with the pressing environmental challenges we have and an inability to allow a sustainable fishery on the west coast. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475866">There is a lack of inclusion of stakeholders and a lack of dealing with the fundamental issues of enabling us to have funding for the salmon hatcheries. If we did not have those salmon hatcheries, essentially we would not have a commercial fishery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475867">We ought to have a system where the government works with the provinces to enforce the laws we have to stop forestry practices from destroying fish beds that are essential for the reproduction of fish.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475868">There is a need for enforcement officers in the area and also an investment in science to do the monitoring that is required. Without this, we cannot have an effective commercial fishery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475869">There is an urgent issue regarding fish farming in the oceans. Open fish farms are placed right in the area where the smolts leave the rivers and go into the ocean. These smolts go by the open fish farms and pick up sea lice, which affects their ability to survive in the open ocean. A simple solution is to move those fish hatcheries out of those areas. The second thing that can be done is to only allow closed fish hatchery systems so the organic matter and other products that grow the fish quickly will not get into the larger ecosystem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475870">The absence of this is a serious problem to British Columbians, and ultimately it will affect our ability to have access to the fish we consume. The failure to do this on the east coast has cost hundreds of thousands of jobs with the collapse of the northern cod fishery. We do not want that to happen in British Columbia. Already there has been a significant contraction of those involved in the fishing industry, and part of it is because of the decline in fish stocks and the excessive pressure that has occurred.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475871">We debated the seal hunt in the House, but we did not deal with the Europeans. European and Asian commercial fishing fleets are raping the world's oceans. They are destroying the world's oceans by creating dead zones. An international effort must be made, and Canada must take the lead on it, to put pressure on the European Union to halt the irresponsible, destructive commercial fishing practices that are destroying the earth's oceans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475872">The minister needs to study the work by Dr. Sylvia Earle, formerly of Woods Hole, Massachusetts and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California. She has eloquently, clearly and scientifically spoken about and detailed the destruction of our oceans. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475873">The oceans are our birthright. They are our responsibility to give to future generations. We can have a sustainable fishery. We can have an ocean system that will be there forever, but it is up to us to implement the solutions required to ensure that happens.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1475877">As a result of the government following a Liberal lead in terms of making the bill effective, this legislation attempts to put a series of fines and legislative mechanisms in place to ensure that such flagrant abuse of our waterways is dealt with in an expeditious and meaningful fashion.

I am looking for the enforcement aspect of the bill, which is absolutely essential.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1475884">Mr. Speaker, my question was going to be similar to that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475885">I want to bring an east coast perspective to this. The <I>Irving Whale</I> was raised in 1996, after its 1970 disaster. There were 4,200 tonnes of oil and PCB contaminants contained in the hull, and three-quarters of that was recovered. In 1996, the costs were $42 million. That disaster was not to the same extent as the <I>Exxon Valdez</I> spill. Therefore, is the $150 million limit appropriate? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475886">With respect to enforcement, the act designates officers who would be responsible for enforcement, but there does not appear to be any succinct indication about where those officers would come from or what resources would be provided to finance their work. While I laud the member for his support of the bill, could he elaborate on what needs to be done with respect to enforcement of the bill? A bill that is well meaning and well intended and supported does not necessarily have efficacy if it cannot be enforced.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1475887">Mr. Speaker, the member is absolutely right. We can have all the laws in the world, but unless there is an enforcement mechanism they are not useful. They are not even as useful as the piece of paper in my right hand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475888">That not only goes for the domestic laws but also the international laws. We have UNCLOS, the UN law of the sea, to which we are a signatory. We have not been able to establish, domestically or internationally, an effective enforcement mechanism. We have a judicial mechanism without an enforcement mechanism, which makes the judicial system not useful at all. This is a fundamental challenge of the signatories to international treaties. We get half the equation correct, but we do not do the other half.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475889">In my community on Vancouver Island, we only have one fisheries officer to do all the work on the southern half of Vancouver Island. That is absolutely impossible. We see a lot of poaching and destruction of habitat, and we have a beleaguered fisheries officer who simply does not have enough time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475890">The government really needs to come to the table to define how it is going to provide the resources to enforce the very laws in this bill.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1475891">Mr. Speaker, I can see that the Liberal Party is the only one interested in talking about environmental issues. Whether they emanate from a commercial-oriented bill or an industrial-dominated bill, we still discuss issues relevant to the environment. Addressing the environment and environmental issues is the 21st century approach to dealing with economic development. Try as we might to infuse all debate with an economic strategy that has the environment as its centrepiece, the basis upon which everything else is built, it appears we are speaking only to ourselves in this House. I mean that figuratively, Mr. Speaker, because you have been very attentive as we have been going through this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475892">When we brought the bill before the House, Liberal members tried to address what my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128753" Type="2">Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca</Affiliation> just indicated. We want to ensure that if there are penalties, if there is a regulatory system, if there are resources to ensure that the semblance of a strategy be in place, that the appropriate resources be put in place and that the enforcement mechanisms are geared to their implementation. We have been trying to do that in the House, and we find that no one is discussing the environmental impacts, other than us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475893">However, so that no one gets the impression we are unaware of the economic impacts of careful environmental stewardship, I will ask the member for <Affiliation DbId="128753" Type="2">Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca</Affiliation> to examine for us the connection between a bill that proposes fines and a regulatory system and the impacts on the environment, not just in the Lower Mainland and the British Columbia coast, but in all of Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1475895">We have to have, as the member correctly alluded to, the yin and the yang of this, which is sustainable development and conservation. Historically, some have thought that it cannot happen, but we have found that it must happen. We have to balance the ability of putting conservation first. With a mind for conservation, we can have sustainable development. We just have to be aware that what we are doing is not going to create and adopt practices that will damage the very biodiversity that is essential for the life of our species. We human beings are part of the web of life. We are all part of one wheel of life. If we damage one part of that wheel, then we are all affected as a result.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1475896">Mr. Speaker, I have a number of items I would like to comment on peripheral to the bill. It gives us a chance to address issues that our constituents have and some are exactly in the legislative wording of the bill. I will concentrate most of the time on issues related to my riding in Yukon and to my role as critic for northern affairs, so issues covering the whole of the Arctic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475897">I want to emphasize on a more global scale the point the member for <Affiliation DbId="128753" Type="2">Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca</Affiliation> made on the book <I>Sea Sick</I>. If we were to add the prevention of pollution in the bill, it would just accelerate the problem that is in that book, a very critical problem in the world, one that is affected by increased carbon dioxide in the seas thereby damaging sea life. This bill goes to prevent, in a number of ways, issues related to oil spills. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475898">Basically, the book makes the point that global warming is bad. However, in addition, the oxygen that we all breathe comes from phytoplankton in the seas and a small degree in pH change could eliminate that. Essentially, the oxygen on earth and the carbon dioxide would dissolve into the oceans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475899"> As the member for <Affiliation DbId="128753" Type="2">Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca</Affiliation> said, there is even much more potent global warming from methane. It is not only coming out of the permafrost as it melts but in huge chunks of frozen methane on the sea bottoms in most parts of the world, including off his riding on the west coast of B.C., off the coast of Japan and of course, in the Arctic. This is a huge concern and Parliament had to bring this to the attention of Canadians this impending crisis, caused by carbon dioxide dissolving in the oceans, to life on earth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475900">I also want to reiterate the point he made about bilge cleaning and oil spills, that we do not need a wreck of a ship to cause tremendous damage, particularly in the very sensitive eco-environment in the Arctic. It is more sensitive, harder to replenish than the oceans in the rest of the world because of the cold temperatures, et cetera. As ships go up there they either dump waste, which I will talk about later, or they clean bilges or they get other species into the waters. There can be a devastating introduction of new species and extinction of the existing species that have been so essential to life in those areas for thousands of years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475901">The bill is good in regard to increasing protection for the seas of the world, the lifeblood of many societies, especially in the Arctic, but we have to continue to work in this area on all these other considerations we are going to talk about. I will be talking about proposed future amendments related to that type of protection.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475902">I want to talk about a technicality in the bill and I would like to compliment the Department of Transport. When the bill first came up in a previous government, there was a serious problem in that it applied the rules related to large ocean-going cruise ships, to small canoes, rafting, outdoor adventure and recreation type businesses. Of course, those businesses, for whatever reason, did not get their message across in the first iteration of the bill, but they certainly did afterward because this could put many of them out of business. The rules just did not fit. They did not make any sense. It could make it prohibitively expensive.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1475903">There is an inherent risk that people accept in adventure tourism. There is a need to staff people with qualifications. For some companies that only do one or two trips a year, some of the provisions did not make any sense. Insurance provisions could have made it totally uneconomic to even have an operation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475904">I certainly compliment the Department of Transport for dealing with the wilderness tourism industry and the Tourism Industry Association of Canada and coming up with amendments to this bill that would not totally wipe out the adventure tourism industry that primarily involves canoes, kayaks and rafts. That is a tremendous improvement to this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475905">I want to talk for a minute about oil spills. This bill contains a great provision in that it amends the Marine Liability Act to implement the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage. Liberal members from B.C. talked about how dramatic oil spill damage can be. Of course, this added liability is very important and it is a good section of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475906">I want to talk for a minute about what is not addressed yet in Canada over and above this and that is oil spills in the Arctic. In the Arctic there is at present no technology to deal with oil spills. The Beaufort project studies in the 1970s were funded by the federal government and industry also contributed. They did a lot of research in this area. There are some extensive volumes of information on this. However, the bottom line is they did not come up with a solution. Within a few days of an oil spill occurring under ice, the damage is irreparable. There is no way of collecting it. There certainly needs to be research in this area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475907">The government is very enthusiastic about the fact that perhaps a third of the world's remaining natural gas reserves and a quarter of oil reserves, something of that magnitude, are in the northern oceans. Yet, a government agency could not issue a permit right now. I know that the government thinks that should be developed, but it could not even issue a permit right now because it has no answer to the environmental damage that would occur due to an oil spill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475908">Statistics make it very clear, I think American statistics, that with the number of projects and developments that take place in the seas, such an oil spill is very likely or at least has a significant probability of occurring. Obviously, we need that protection. As I said earlier, any type of chemical or species damage in the very sensitive Arctic environments could cause long-lasting irreparable damage to the oceans, the life in the oceans and, of course, to the indigenous people who have used the ocean life for thousands of years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475909">We need to get on with it very quickly. There should be encouragement from all parties to do the research and invest more in research, likely in collaboration with oil companies, on mechanisms for cleaning up the inevitable hydrocarbon spills in the oceans of the Arctic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475910">The record so far on increasing specific research projects in the north is not good. In the last budget, for instance, the Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences has been cancelled. The three main granting councils in Canada have lost money and researchers, and I believe a letter from 2,000 scientists in the country decried that. The Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences funds things like Eureka, the closest post to the North Pole. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1475911">If we are interested in sovereignty, obviously we want scientists in the north. Why would we be cutting and closing our most northern establishment in Canada? It is a backward step related to sovereignty, but more importantly it is a backward step related to Arctic science. It is great that we are increasing facilities in the north, but it is not great if they are going to be empty facilities without any scientists there. I want to really enforce that particular point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475912">I also want to pick up on an excellent point made by the member for <Affiliation DbId="128381" Type="2">Moncton—Riverview—Dieppe</Affiliation> on enforcement. There have been a number of bills to increase enforcement provisions. This is just another one in the order. We must increase our enforcement ability. That is generally accepted and I am sure this bill will pass in Parliament. However, the problem identified over and over again is that the will of the government to provide the enforcement and the resources to actually enforce these things is lacking. A good example is on the inspections related to listeriosis. The government set up a system where there would be fewer inspections on the floor, moving the inspectors off the floor of the meat plants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475913"> Another example was a proposed bill that I think has been hoisted because it was kind of inconceivable, but it was a bill to reduce inspections of grain. This would not only jeopardize human life but would jeopardize Canada's reputation around the world by reducing the inward inspections of Canadian grain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475914">A third example was in Bill <Document DbId="3628791" Type="3">C-3</Document>. We just recently extended Canada's ability to enforce the Arctic waters. I think it was unanimously passed. That was great. We extended Pierre Trudeau's bill from 100 miles to 200 miles because of the Law of the Sea change. So it was an administrative change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475915">Therefore, we increased the area where Canada could apply enforcement by a huge amount, the size of Saskatchewan, yet there was not one penny more allowed for enforcement to cover that area. I think our critic, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128743" Type="2">Eglinton—Lawrence</Affiliation>, made that point very eloquently in debate. It is like saying the Toronto police force added another city the size of Toronto to be enforced, but no police officers are added. What is the use of having a law with no enforcement capabilities?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475916">When questioned on that, it was suggested that we have one propeller plane for the Pacific Ocean, one propeller plane for the Arctic Ocean, and one propeller plane for the Atlantic Ocean. I know one of the northern scientist experts, a professor, was kind of laughing at that. I really do not think that is sufficient monitoring enforcement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475917">Another answer was that we have increased the environmental inspectors, but remember that we are extending the area of enforcement from 100 miles to 200 miles, so we start at 100 miles out to sea and go out 200 miles out to sea in the Arctic. We asked where the inspectors were being placed and the answer was Yellowknife. If we look at a map of Canada, we can see how many hundreds and hundreds of miles Yellowknife is from the ocean, and then we would have to go 100 miles out before the bill even came into effect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475918">We have a bill here that increases enforcement. I would just encourage the government to make sure that we are all in favour of the items in here and that it supports the spirit of bill in making sure that it can be enforced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475919">I want to talk about some amendments that I propose for the future. The reason I have not brought them forward yet is that these are amendments related to this type of bill and a number of other bills.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475920">The problem is that there are a number of items related to shipping, shipping pollution, dumping, oil spills, and the structure of boats that are capable of going through the Arctic spread through a whole bunch of acts. It is very hard to figure out the appropriate place for the amendments that I am going to talk about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475921">I am putting them on the table now, just to forewarn people. I am hoping that the experts in the federal bureaucracy may have an interdepartmental committee to sit down and decide whether these things that are scattered through a number of bills, probably more than half a dozen bills, should actually be in one bill, how the deficiencies should be dealt with, or whether they should be in more than one bill. Therefore, I am putting on the record some ideas for amendments. These could be looked at in the future if the experts in the various departments and the stakeholders think they are necessary.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="30">(1130)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1475922">Organizations like the Canadian Bar Association, the National Maritime Law Section, the Canadian Maritime Law Association, Wilderness Tourism Association of the Yukon, International Ship-Owners Alliance of Canada, Canadian Shipowners Association, Tourism Industry Association of Canada had input in the bill. If they think these types of amendments are important and are needed, they can provide feedback to me and government officials. Environmental associations can also so the same thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475923">As an example of one problem, under the Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act, ships can dump grey water into the Arctic Ocean. I have spoken twice on the sensitivity of that ocean to detrimental substances. In fact, a couple of summers ago the government specifically mentioned that the navy, on individual occasions, would apply for permits to dump grey water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475924">These are the types of things at which we need to look. Are they necessary or can they be avoided in order to help protect that environment, especially with today's increasingly effective technology to protect the environment by building containments within ships.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475925">The first amendment is for ships travelling Canadian Arctic waters. They would have to adhere to a zero tolerance policy with regard to the dumping of waste in these waters. Personally I think that is feasible. I have had no feedback saying it is not because of the modern technology available to us. It may cost cruise lines and military vessels, but it should be investigated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475926">The second amendment is the dumping of waste in Arctic waters would be subject to a first offence penalty. This amendment relates to the fact that there were some limited enforcement mechanisms in some bills. Dumping of waste in Arctic waters would be subject to a first offence financial penalty regime, depending on the nature of the waste dumped, extent of the quality of the waste dumped and the estimated damage on the pristine Arctic water ecosystem, plus cleanup costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475927">The third amendment is repeat offences would result in more severe financial penalties, including the clean up of environmental damage cost and/or incarceration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475928">The fourth amendment is it would be incumbent upon shippers entering Canadian waters to provide proof of insurance liability to offset pollution mishap, cleanups or dumping violations. We heard earlier about the tremendous cost of the <I>Exxon Valdez</I> spill, which was far more than what was specifically provided for. The member for <Affiliation DbId="128563" Type="2">Newton—North Delta</Affiliation> made that point, but what if that had been under ice? It would have been substantially worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475929">The next amendment is ocean going tankers would need to carry a minimum $1 billion per load liability policy. Smaller barges and vessels carrying cargo that could result in toxic or oil spills would need to carry a minimum of $250 million liability policy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475930">The next amendment is other freighter vessels and container ships would need to carry a minimum of $500 million per load liability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475931">The second last amendment is cruise lines would need to carry a $350 million liability policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475932">The last amendment is all vessels travelling in Canadian waters would be subject to Canadian Coast Guard, Canadian armed forces and Canadian Environmental Service boarding and inspection for potential environmental spills, dumping or violation of shipping standards in Arctic waters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475933">I put that out for the government officials and stakeholders to provide feedback and to start discussion on improving our protection of the pristine and very vulnerable Arctic ecosystems.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1475934">Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128784" Type="2">Yukon</Affiliation> for raising some very important issues in the context of this legislation. There are several, but I will pick up on one of the latter issues, and that is all of that which is resident under the permafrost is under the ice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475935">My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128784" Type="2">Yukon</Affiliation> has mentioned on several occasions, with respect to this bill and Bill <Document DbId="3628791" Type="3">C-3</Document>, that it is important to protect the environment and the interests of the aboriginal communities there. I note people in the audience are following this debate attentively. They picked up on that issue as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475936">My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128784" Type="2">Yukon</Affiliation> knows very well that one of the issues we attempted to raise with Bill <Document DbId="3630955" Type="3">C-7</Document> was that vessels would potentially go through the Northwest Passage. He made reference to the fact that potentially a great number of scientists and geophysicists would look at the latent, vast deposits of petroleum resident in that part of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475937">For example, the 2008 U.S. geological survey found that 13% of all the untapped, undiscovered petroleum deposits were resident in Canada's Nordic lands under the ice sheets. Further, it found that 30% of the natural gas deposits worldwide were resident off the shore of Yukon and northwest of Nunavut. Indeed, 20% of all liquefied natural gas products were resident in that same place. When we have an environmental accident, where vessels that are not prepared to assume their responsibility travel through these waters, the potential for environmental disaster is huge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475938">My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128784" Type="2">Yukon</Affiliation> mentioned a moment ago that all such vessels travelling in this area ought to carry a liability of some $2 billion. The bill does not go that far. Could the member elaborate on the relationship between the liability that must be carried by these commercial operators and the environmental requirements of not only the north but all of Canada?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1475940">We need to have a degree of liability that is economically affordable, but the economic costs of environmental damage to society and the environment are massive and huge. Sometimes they are not taken into account in simple economic evaluations. He mentioned the Northwest Passage. While there are several points about the Northwest Passage, he talked about the economics. There would be a huge savings for ships that would go through the passage. Therefore, they could afford this extra liability insurance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475941">Additionally, cruise ships are very important to my riding. On one hand, I would not want to put them out of business. On the other hand, it has to be in the cost of the package, and technology would allow it, that the environment is protected. The Canadian government can help by having many more navigational aids and ensuring those cruise ships are safe. This would reduce the possibility of an accident, such as the one that occurred in Antarctica.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1475943">My colleague talked about cruise ships as well, which is an emerging business along our northern shores. Cruise ship operators constantly worry about the costs that they would have to bear if they offloaded their effluents beyond the 12 mile limit, or close to about 20 kilometres, especially in the way it is determined in their calculation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475944">My colleague is an expert in these areas. Could he elaborate of just how precise and how important that connection between environmental safety and commercial development is to Canadians everywhere?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1475945">Mr. Speaker, my colleague makes a good point. The cruise ship industry will be happy if I put on the record the fact that the industry thinks the regulations and fees put on them by Alaska have almost closed down the industry. All the tourists we get off cruise ships in Yukon come from Alaska. That has a huge effect on our tourism industry. We cannot over-regulate to the extent that we put them out of business, which in turn results in tourists not coming to our area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475946">However, that does not mean we cannot protect the environment. We could provide research for these companies with respect to grey water on their ships as an example. With respect to making cuts in research, research officers in the northern research council are going to be eliminated, and this is absurd.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475947">If we are putting this onus on cruise ships, we could improve the services we provide for them. The north is a very dangerous area, and it is not only the ice that presents a danger. Under the Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act of 1970, cruise ships need to be of a certain structure to go in the north. Ice packs move around unpredictably. Part of the Northwest Passage is very dangerous because there are shallow areas and submerged rocks. These need to be charted and the ships need to have navigational aids. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475948">We need to provide better search and rescue services. Companies that go there want to know their passengers will be safe and help will be there for them in an emergency. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475949">These are types of things the Canadian government could invest in to offset the cost to cruise ships and commercial boats. This will result in a win-win situation for everybody.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1475961">Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak to Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document> concerning matrimonial real property on first nation reserves. This is the second time the government has brought the bill forward. Its previous iteration died on the order paper in 2008 when the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> broke his own policy and called an early election. It certainly undermines the government's position on this and other bills when it claims the importance of its legislative agenda only to pull the plug on Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475962">This is not to suggest that the issue of matrimonial law and family law in particular on first nations communities is not important, far from it. There is a significant gap in the law and it is important that the gap be filled. It is fair to say that there is broad agreement by the department, by all parties in the House, by first nations governments, by women's equality groups and by members of the family law and first nations bar that something must be done. We can all agree that work has to take place to put a legal framework in place to protect the interests of women, of families and of children when there is a breakdown in a domestic relationship involving matrimonial real property on first nations reserve land.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475963">Where our party differs from the government is on the approach to this complicated question. This is unfortunate. We saw only last week in the case of the Cree-Naskapi act amendments what difference a cooperative and inclusive approach can make. In that case the Cree nation whose interests were directly involved were able to work with government on a bill that received immediate support. It was a matter of intensive negotiation involving those most affected every step of the way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475964">I realize that reforming matrimonial property law in all first nations reserves is a question that is different and it is unique. It is unique in the sheer number of first nations involved that make the need for consultation and cooperation that much more important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475965">The minister claims that first nations groups were involved in a comprehensive consultation on this bill, but that is not what I am hearing on the ground. The minister may think he consulted, but the people he should have consulted tell me otherwise. It is incumbent upon government to be inclusive and transparent in its dealings with aboriginal peoples. It has to act in a way which is consistent with the honour of the Crown. The process leading up to Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document> fails this test.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475966">Since Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document> was introduced for a second time at first reading, I have had meetings and other communications with numerous stakeholders. These include first nations women's organizations, first nations governments, regional and national assemblies of first nations, and individuals. The sheer number of representations made to me on this bill far exceeds the number I have dealt with on any other piece of legislation. Not only is the number of contacts striking, so is the virtual unanimity of what they are telling me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475967">Anyone who has been involved in aboriginal policy for as long as I have can say that we do not often hear many first nations leaders singing the same tune. The diversity of opinions can be stark. The differences of opinion can be animated. But on the question of Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document>, I have heard absolutely no one from first nations communities in any capacity speak in favour of the substance or the approach of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475968">The Native Women's Association of Canada is opposed. Like others, including myself, while we recognize the need for a change to the legal framework, there has to be a recognition of broader issues associated with family law in first nations. There are issues of access to justice, violence prevention and the balancing of individual rights and the collective rights of first nations peoples which are left unaddressed. In fact, NWAC has argued that Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document>, far from protecting the rights of women, diminishes them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475969">The Assembly of First Nations has passed policy resolutions supporting a reconciliation of first nations, provincial and federal jurisdictions over matrimonial real property; a reconciliation, not an imposition.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1475970">The AFN also supports a broader approach, including both legislative and non-legislative approaches to family law issues. The AFN Women's Council has also rejected the government's matrimonial real property approach, both in this bill and in its former incarnation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475971">The government defends this bill by invoking the language of rights. I cannot say that I accept that argument, not from a government which continues to drag its heels on the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. In fact, it is an embarrassment to Canada on the international stage that the Conservative government has so actively opposed that important international document.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1475980">I would ask people to note the language that aboriginal nations consult with government, not that government imposes top-heavy legislation of its own. It is troubling that despite being rejected by the very people whom it purports to protect, the government forged ahead with the bill anyway. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475981">Not only that, Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document> also flies in the face of what the government's own ministerial representative recommended. Many of Wendy Grant-John's recommendations were ignored, including those concerning certificates of possession and the registration of spousal interests, the enforceability of first nations dispute resolutions and a statutory review of the legislation after three years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475982">Legislation on its own, without looking at the broader picture and without taking a holistic approach, may well do more harm than good. Imposing federal legislation is not a positive approach in the new era of relations with aboriginal peoples that should have been opened up with last year's historic residential schools apology. Things have to be done differently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475983">There may well be a place for federal legislation but only in a way that respects and encourages appropriate and holistic first nations law and non-legislative approaches to family law issues, domestic violence and matrimonial law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475984">Another issue which has to be addressed as part of a broader solution is that of on-reserve housing. The questions of matrimonial real property, domestic violence and access to recourse on the breakdown of a domestic partnership are intimately tied to the availability of housing on first nations land. That is true both for short-term housing solutions such as family shelters or safe houses and long-term housing, making an adequate number of homes of adequate quality for the needs of first nations populations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475985">The minister says that Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document> would allow for first nations solutions. However, first nations have not been given the time or resources that would allow them to develop and implement their own family law and other support structures consistent with the diversity of first nations cultures. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475986">The government's approach is one size fits all. It has not worked in the past and it will not work in the present or in the future. Canada learned that lesson the hard way through the residential schools experience.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="55">(1155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1475987">There are legitimate questions about the verification process and the ratification rules set down which first nations would have to abide by in order to have their own law recognized. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475988">To first nations people, this hearkens back to the days of the Indian agent, when they had an overseer, someone who would say what was right or what was wrong, what was appropriate or inappropriate in first nations communities. It flies in the face of the inherent right to self-government and the nation to nation relationship. It is a colonialist approach, an assimilationist approach, a paternalistic approach, and believe me, I use those words deliberately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475989">I ask, what about the first nations cultures, traditions and legal customs which are based on matrilineal descent? Many first nations have their own matrilineal or other customary law concerning marriage and families passed down through the generations. There are cultures with matrilineal descent, others which place special emphasis on extended families or family relationships which go beyond the western emphasis on the nuclear family. These aspects of first nations culture, in many cases, form customary law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475990">Similarly in Canada, outside Quebec which has its own unique civil code, we have customary laws too. They are no less laws because they stem from custom. They stem from an old English custom with an old English name. That customary law is called the common law. These first nations laws can be used to fill the legal gap, which Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document> attempts to do so clumsily. First nations need the time and resources to do so, time and resources which the government, in Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document>, fails to give.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475991">All parties need the time for full and transparent consultation. First nations need the time to develop and plan their own solutions, solutions which respect and promote their own cultural values, customary law and particular social and economic circumstances. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475992">Government can and should be a partner in that process with the first nations. Government can and should provide the necessary support, including assisting first nations and first nations women and families to address access to law, law enforcement and enforcement of orders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475993">Government must act more concertedly to address the broader social and economic issues that are intimately tied up with family law on first nations reserves, including violence prevention, health care, addictions and housing. None of these social ills is unique to first nations. Unfortunately, that is far from being the case. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475994">Government must give first nations communities and their governments just that additional window of time to develop solutions which can be built from the ground up, instead of being imposed from the top down. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1475995">A better approach would be to work productively and transparently with first nations; work with first nations governments to develop their own laws and the administrative support for their operation; work with first nations governments and citizens on the full spectrum of approaches, legislative and non-legislative, to family law. Where federal legislation is required, first nations should be brought to the table to help in the drafting of a bill that can obtain a much broader consensus. The government should engage in that intensive consultation that is required.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1476007">Madam Speaker, this motion is firm. It is rooted in the discussions and in the consultations in the broader sense that we have had with the first nations women and first nations families. Not one individual or group has come forward to support sending Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document> to committee. If we are going to be honest about how we go forward with aboriginal people, if we are going to walk that path together, we must honour their voices and the direction they give to us as parliamentarians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476008">I can say to the member that it is fine to talk about human rights. Last year the government used aboriginal women, and I will say this very clearly, and put them in the window and said that it wanted to repeal section 67 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, the exemption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476009">When that came into force, there was a case brought to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal against the Government of Canada by first nations. What did the government do? It said that the Human Rights Tribunal had no jurisdiction. It talks about rights but it does not put it into practice. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476010">I have no responsibility to give notice but when I spoke with people in the department and in the minister's office I have indicated to them that we did not support Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document>. They asked if Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document> would go to second reading and I said that there was no assurance today that it would go to committee anytime soon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476011">We have listened to what the first nations people have told us and we have respected what they have told us.

There is not one outcome where aboriginal people are ahead of the rest of the Canadian population. They have substandard housing, high unemployment, high suicide rates and a massive number of children in care. Some estimate it to be 27,000 people in care with first nations and non-first nations agencies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476017">This is what the imposed approach, the colonialist, assimilationist approach has done. On June 11 of last year, there was an apology.

              <ParaText id="1476018">All of the comments I have heard around Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document>, the first nations people say that this reminds them of when they had Indian agents decades ago.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1476026">Madam Speaker, we are discussing an extremely important bill. I, too, am somewhat surprised by my Liberal colleague's position. I do not think that his is the right approach just now, particularly when it comes to the matrimonial rights of aboriginal peoples. This bill has gone by several numbers, of which I will list just two. Bill <Document DbId="3314226" Type="3">C-47</Document> died on the order paper last year when the election was called, and now we have Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476027">The Bloc Québécois believes, and I hope the NDP will agree, that this bill should be studied in committee. It is of utmost importance that this bill be debated, analyzed and closely examined with witnesses by the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development. Allow me to explain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476028">I am aware of the rules of Parliament. By presenting an amendment to delay study of the bill for six months, the Liberal Party knows full well that the bill will die on the order paper. I am absolutely certain that that is not what aboriginal women want. They want respect, and the Bloc Québécois believes that aboriginal women will get respect if we study the matter of matrimonial rights respectfully once and for all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476029">I hope that my Conservative Party colleagues will not take it for granted that our support for Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document> is firm and unconditional. I want to say right now that we really do not like Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document>, not one bit. It does have some good points and measures, but some things in the bill are just not well thought out. If the government is serious about this, and I hope that it is, it will understand that we want to take as much time as we need in committee to properly study this bill, pick it apart and amend it as necessary. This bill must meet the needs of aboriginal women, first nations and aboriginal peoples across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476030">The government will have to explain why it set aside the main recommendations made by Ms. Grant-John, who did an exceptional job of examining this issue. The issue of matrimonial rights has been around for a number of years. With all due respect, the Liberals do not have a leg to stand on when criticizing the Conservatives at this stage regarding Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document>. It was the Liberals who introduced the famous Bill C-31 on women's matrimonial rights, the 1985 bill that erased women's rights in their entirety in one fell swoop. They should remember that the bill languished. Although the Conservatives adopted the bill, it originated with the Liberals some time before that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476031">It is odd because the Liberals know this. An extremely interesting ruling was just handed down by the Court of Appeal. It concerns the rights of aboriginal peoples, especially women's rights. This ruling was handed down on April 6, 2009.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="15">(1215)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1476032">The government will have to take it into account because the British Columbia Court of Appeal ruling overturns several decisions and forces the government to recognize that it imposed a law that discriminated against aboriginal peoples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476033">In the matter at hand—and we will come to an agreement rather quickly—it is clear that 90% to 95% of the matrimonial rights cases concern women and children in native communities. It is equally clear that the rights of women have been violated. In my opinion, moving forward and adopting the amendment would kill the bill. With all due respect for my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128757" Type="2">Labrador</Affiliation>, and based on my extensive experience, I know that unless the government is forced to act it will not do so. In this case, it is not true that there will be further consultations if we give the government six more months. That is not true. I do not buy it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476034">We in the Bloc Québécois prefer to move forward, and I hope that my NDP colleagues will feel the same way. I hope that what I am about to say will be well translated and that our friends opposite will understand me clearly. I have just one hope, and that is that they do not seriously believe we are going to pass this bill in a rush and study it quickly in committee. It will take months. I hope they realize that, because if they do not, then there will be trouble. But that is very clear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476035">I have a few questions. Why is it that Ms. Grant-John's entire report was set aside?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476036">Why is it that none of the recommendations made by the rapporteur, Ms. Corbett, were acted on?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476037">It is odd, because I was looking for support for this bill among aboriginal women in Canada and in Quebec, but both groups said no. I spoke this morning with Grand Chief Picard, who also has problems with this bill. But I will give it a chance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476038">In my opinion, the Bloc Québécois, probably with the support of the NDP, will be willing to refer this very, very important bill to the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development so that it is studied properly in the interest of the rights of women living in aboriginal communities. This problem has existed in aboriginal communities for too long, and we must find solutions. For my part, I believe, with all due respect, that having a minority government is not a bad thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476039">We have seen evidence of this. I will give my colleagues opposite the chance to respond. I will quickly give a brief history of Bill <Document DbId="3095171" Type="3">C-21</Document>, which was passed during the previous session. This bill repealed section 67 of the Indian Act. As a result, aboriginal communities will now be accountable, and complaints can be filed against them with the Human Rights Commission. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476040">Our Conservative colleagues opposite were opposed to all the amendments we had made to the bill. The original bill consisted of just one clause. When it came out of committee, was reported in this House and was passed, it included 12 or 13 clauses. I was very closely involved in the study of the bill, and I can tell you that it was thanks to the aboriginal communities and all the members of the committee that we were able to seriously amend Bill <Document DbId="3095171" Type="3">C-21</Document> so that it respected the rights of aboriginal peoples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476041">I have a problem with hoisting this bill. In my opinion, we need to study it and make amendments, and we need especially to heed the protests of the aboriginal women who were not consulted.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1476042">There is a Supreme Court decision about consultation with respect to Supreme Court rulings. If this is the case, I do not believe, with all due respect for my colleagues across the way, that such consultation has taken place. They could have taken a few more months. We will set the process in motion during those months and it will take the time it needs to take. The Bloc Québécois wants to see this bill amended to take the rights of aboriginal women on reserves into consideration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476043">The situation can be easily summarized. An aboriginal couple marries, has children and accumulates assets on reserve. They might, for instance, own a convenience store, a service station or some other business. The couple separates. The woman leaves the marital home, as usually happens, unfortunately, and leaves the reserve. She settles in town or somewhere else. Then comes the issue of who owns the convenience store, the garage or the business. They are located on the reserve and thus on federal territory. The situation is not clear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476044">The Bloc Québécois wants to examine this bill. A lot of work has been done on it by the Mohawk Council of Akwesasne, and they have sent recommendations to us. I have read them and I believe that they need to be taken into consideration because a number of Mohawk communities, and probably some others as well, have what is called a matrimonial property rights tribunal. These are in place in the communities and we must respect what is being done in the communities. We need to take steps to ensure that we respect what is already in place, but the bill as it stands is not clear about this. What is more, the government seems to want to have a degree of control over the settlement of matrimonial property rights on the reserves, but I must admit this is not clear. If the regulations do not work, the federal government could change them. I believe I read that. If the government wants to go ahead with this, there is going to be a serious problem. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476045">However, I want to point out that matrimonial rights have a huge impact on communities. Often, the women and children wind up with nothing and are expelled from the reserve, while the men keep everything. I do not want to generalize, but I would say that this is what happens in 80% or 90% of cases. I know, because I live in Abitibi-Témiscamingue and I have a good idea of what is happening in my communities. We must not be blind or ignore what is happening. We need to pay attention and take into account individual and collective rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476046">There will be a serious debate about collective versus individual rights. This bill is not clear. It deserves to be debated and examined in greater detail. I will say to my Liberal colleagues, as I said at the start, that the worst that could happen would be that, if the committee is not happy with the responses and if the amendments we propose are not incorporated, we kill the bill. The three opposition parties can kill the bill, obviously. The government will have to understand that it is in its interest to respect what aboriginal communities want, which is not to be pushed around. They want to be heard. The main groups want to be heard and want to have a chance to speak.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476047">I have asked that they propose amendments. We will have to look at the clauses. I know that aboriginal communities and groups, the Native Women's Association and the Assembly of First Nations of Canada may be opposed to the bill as it currently stands.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1476048">In life, it is not enough just to be opposed to something. You have to come up with solutions to the problem. When a party is opposed to the bill, I respect its position. But what solutions does it have? What amendments does it propose? This bill also raises the whole debate about incorporating provincial and territorial laws. The problem of respecting women's rights has never been easy to solve, and it will not be easy to solve with Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476049">But if we do not make the effort to sit down all together at the same table to discuss, amend and adapt this bill so that it respects women's rights, we will miss the boat and pay the price. I especially do not want to be pushed around on this issue. I want us to take our time and study this bill carefully, and I want us to listen to the groups that propose amendments that we will study and analyze. I hope that the government does not think that this bill will be passed before the end of the current session. If it does, then we will have a serious problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476050">This is a very important bill. Bill C-21 repealed section 67 of the Indian Act. We took the time we needed, and we did things properly. We also passed a bill about specific claims. We took the time to talk to aboriginal communities and aboriginal association representatives. This is a good bill that should satisfy aboriginal communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476051">This morning, the committee—and I am in a position to know—passed Bill <Document DbId="3831702" Type="3">C-28</Document> without amendment, or rather, with a small amendment concerning syntax. The bill should be back before the House when we return from the Victoria Day recess or, in our case, the fête des Patriotes. We passed the bill, and the Cree people are satisfied. It took 10 years, but now it is done. I am not suggesting that it will take 10 years to pass Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document>, but I think that it will take a few months. We have to take the time to listen to aboriginal community representatives. Important things, such as federal legislation on matrimonial property and recognition of the jurisdiction of first nations, must be taken into account. How will we do that?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476052">I will end with a discussion of a principle that I believe in: if one wants what one has never had, one must be prepared to do what one has never done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476053">We are about to do something that we have never done: respect aboriginal women. That is what we will do as we study the bill in the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development over the next few months.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1476067">Madam Speaker, I am speaking today to the motion to adjourn debate on Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document> for six months. I, too, will recommend that the NDP not support the motion to amend and that we work toward getting the bill to committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476068">It is a very difficult decision. I believe Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document> on matrimonial real property is a deeply flawed legislation. However, it is well past time to work toward solutions. We simply cannot, in good conscience, continue to leave this matter unresolved. I want to explain why I say that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476069"> We have a long, sad and sorry history when it comes to matrimonial real property rights in Canada. Sadly, it reflects on both past Conservative governments and past Liberal governments. This is an occasion where both governing parties hold full responsibility for not taking earlier action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476070">I want to review a historical timeline so Canadians are well aware of the fact that this issue has had debate after debate and report after report, and we have failed to move toward any kind of solution. It is largely women and children who are impacted by this lack of action, but men and women continue to suffer in aboriginal communities. They do not have any legitimate legal recourse to see an appropriate division of the matrimonial home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476071">When I talk about the historical timeline, there are a couple of key points. I think this is a good reminder. Prior to colonization, first nations' cultural norms, kinship systems and laws determined the outcomes of marriage breakdown. Matriarchal kinship systems and egalitarian values were common. We have a history where, prior to contact and colonialism, first nations had their own rules and regulations when families disbanded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476072">Part of what first nations have been demanding is a recognition of those laws and customs. First nations will say that they are fully intent on honouring charter obligations in every respect. However, there is a long history. First nations occupied this land for thousands of years. They had developed systems to deal with marital breakdown.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476073">Many things happened during the colonial period. The notion of individual property rights and male domination in property and civil rights were introduced by colonial governments in an effort to assimilate first nations people, with the hopes of ultimate eliminating reserves altogether. One sees this transition from laws that had been in place for thousands of years to a colonial period, where first nations were severely impacted by a notion of male domination. Many of the kinship and matriarchal systems were disbanded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476074">Post-Confederation, we had Indian legislation. There was a whole series of things, but first nations women were not permitted to vote in band council elections. There was gender-based discrimination in wills and estate laws. Throughout this period, the notion of equality rights did not exist in Canadian law. Women on and off reserve had very few legal protections from matrimonial property and were at a significant legal disadvantage compared to men. The Indian Act does not address matrimonial property rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476075">Finally, in 1986, people started to wake up. Again, this is in the context of why we should not abandon debate. Court cases that took place 1986 finally said that things had to change. Two cases concerning the extent to which provincial laws and matrimonial property might be applied to individual interest in reserve lands reached the Supreme Court of Canada. One of them was Derrickson v. Derrickson. The other was Paul v. Paul.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476076">The Supreme Court decided that provincial laws could not apply in any way that would change any individual property interest that a first nation person may hold under the Indian Act. Further, it went on to say:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Silence of the Indian Act and the non-recognition of First Nation jurisdiction on the matter means many basic protections not available to male or female spouses on reserves; women are particularly negatively impacted by the legislative gap because they still are more often the primary caregivers of young children.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="1476078">Twenthy-three years ago Supreme Court rulings indicated that the federal government was allowing provincial law to erroneously apply on reserve and that there needed to be a federal resolution to recognize the special status on reserve. This is one of the primary reasons New Democrats believe we need to get this to committee so we can talk about the availability of other solutions. What proposals are the men and women in first nations communities putting forward?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476079">We have the national organizations, but there are other voices in these communities to which we need to listened. We know some customary laws are already in place. Let us take a look at some of those examples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476080">From 1990 to the present, and again this is the sad history, eight United Nations human rights bodies have expressed concern about the issue of matrimonial real property on reserves. Internationally we are being pointed to for this lack of movement on matrimonial real property. Litigation on lack of protection for matrimonial real property rights is launched by a first nations women's organization. Women's organizations have been saying they need solutions to this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476081">In 2003 the Senate Standing Committee on Human Rights issued its first report calling for legislative action on the question, consultations with first nations and first nations organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476082">In 2005 the House of Commons Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development issued a report calling for legislative action on the question and recognized the inherent rights of first nations respecting matrimonial real property.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476083">In 2006 the House of Commons Standing Committee on the Status of Women took up the issue of matrimonial real property on reserves and it continues to monitor it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476084">In that context, with so many different bodies, both internationally and within Canada, calling for us to move towards some action, I believe it is important. The Liberal member talked about playing politics. It is important that we do not play politics with this matter and that we take the opportunity to get it to committee so we can call in witnesses from across the country, so we do not play politics with it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476085">I want to refer back to the government response to the fifth report of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, this was AANO 38-1. It talked about the fact that since 2001, Indian and Northern Affairs Canada has done significant research and has produced a number of publications on the issue of matrimonial real property, including a comprehensive discussion paper to better understand the issues from a sociological and legal perspective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476086">Since all of this work has already been done, it seems important that we look at it, that we look at the sociological and legal perspectives and that we look at some of the proposals that have come forward.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1476110">Again, in the context of this delaying motion, the reason it is important to talk about matrimonial real property is that it is urgent that at the committee we also talk about non-legislative solutions and what is really needed to support families on reserve, whether it is adequate housing, access to education or access to conflict resolution and mediation that could actually prevent family breakup. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476111">In the report on the first nations child and family services program, the Auditor General talked about the fact that there is so little investment in preventive measures that children are being removed from their homes. The agencies have a mandate to remove children, but they do not have a mandate to support families, keep those families together and keep the children in their homes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476112">I would argue that rather than delay talking about these very serious issues, we should welcome the opportunity to talk about non-legislative options. We should welcome the opportunity to talk about what kind of housing is needed on reserve to support families. If a family does need to break up, the reality right now is that women and children can be forced to leave their reserve, their home community because there is not any housing for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476113">I find it difficult to support the delay of talking about these very serious fundamental human rights issues. I would suggest that first nations communities from coast to coast to coast do have some solutions that would be welcomed by all members of the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476114">I am running out of time, but I want to touch on a couple of other issues. Several first nations organizations across this country are working on issues around citizenship. That is fundamental to what we are talking about. Who gets to determine who has citizenship in a particular nation? I know that Six Nations and NAN are working on citizenship codes. This would be an opportunity to bring forward those citizenship codes to the committee in the context of matrimonial real property. Fundamentally, that is what we are talking about. We are talking about who has a right to live on reserve, who has a right to the house, and who has a right to that citizenship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476115">Perhaps it will also give us an opportunity to talk about the 1985, Bill C-31, which reinstated the citizenship of women who married non-aboriginal men and lost their citizenship. But of course there were not the non-legislative solutions to deal with the housing issues these women were facing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476116">This is an opportunity to have a much broader discussion on human rights, on the aspects that are impacting on families, on the more creative solutions, the more respectful solutions, the more traditional solutions that would serve first nations and their families in a reasonable fashion. </ParaText>

Does she support a bill that is called a racist bill by the first nations organizations? What I am reading from their notes to me is that it is an imposition, it is colonialism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476127">It is a bill that is contrary to the recommendation of the comprehensive report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, which was tabled in 1996. It is a bill that violates the jurisdictional rights of the first nations. Women are saying it is offensive, that their rights are being undermined and that they have not been consulted. Some 60% of the population has not been consulted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476128">Does the member feel comfortable supporting a bill that is so flawed that aboriginal women do not like the bill? Would she support a bill when the appearance of addressing the term “women's issues”, which is being used by the Conservatives to make everyone kowtow to the bill, has failed to deal with numerous and substantial problems facing women, which are violence, adequate housing, poor health, et cetera? I would like her response.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1476152">The bill offers a practical effective solution to the long list of legal and technical issues related to on-reserve matrimonial real property. These issues have been the focus of much study, consultation and discussion in recent years. A review of the many published reports reveals several common themes and recommendations for action. These ideas helped shape the legislation now before us and, taken in their entirety, are a compelling, even overwhelming, argument for voting in favour of Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476153">While other hon. members addressing the legislation have focused primarily on technical issues, I will adopt a different approach. I propose to outline the key findings of recent matrimonial real property research and consultation and link them to Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document>. This approach will demonstrate the considerable value of the legislation now before us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476154">I will begin with the findings of several United Nations committees. Canada is an active participant not only in the United Nations itself but also in several UN conventions and organizations. A report published in November 2005 by the United Nations Human Rights Committee touches on the issue of matrimonial real property. Among the report's recommendations is one which suggests that Canada:</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476156">A second body, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, issued a similar call to action. This group called on Canada to develop a solution in consultation with the communities concerned. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476157">Of course, there is also a long history of calls for reform from within Canada. In 1988, for example, the province of Manitoba launched an inquiry into the justice system's treatment of aboriginal peoples. The inquiry's final report identified a host of issues, including the lack of an effective regime dealing with on-reserve MRP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476158">The 1996 report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples also examined the issue of matrimonial rights. The report recommended that:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1476161">While all of these reports included calls for a legislative solution to the issue of matrimonial property rights, there was, however, no clear consensus on how such legislation should be structured. Various options, such as amendments to the Indian Act, stand-alone legislation and the application of provincial and territorial laws have all been advanced. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476162">Three parliamentary committees considered the challenges associated with potential legislative approaches to on-reserve matrimonial property rights. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476163">The Senate Standing Committee on Human Rights, for example, staged a series of hearings and published an interim report in 2003. The report, titled, “A Hard Bed to Lie In: Matrimonial Real Property on Reserve”, included a number of pertinent recommendations, including legislation that would validate matrimonial laws developed and implemented by first nations. The report also called on government to transfer money to aboriginal women's groups for the purpose of conducting thorough consultations on the issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476164">Three years later, the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development launched another study and considered the testimony of more than 30 witnesses. The committee's report, “Walking Arm-in-Arm to Resolve the Issue of On-Reserve Matrimonial Real Property”, determined that, to be effective, MRP legislation must be developed in consultation and collaboration with first nations. The committee also stated that any legislation must balance individual equality rights and collective first nations rights. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476165">Recommendations for consultation and legislative change were echoed in the report of the Standing Committee on the Status of Women in June 2006.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476166">The guidance provided by parliamentarians expressed in the studies that I have cited forms the core of this government's strategy on matrimonial property rights. This government did in fact provide over $8 million to the Native Women's Association of Canada and the Assembly of First Nations to carry out a consultation process. A ministerial representative was contracted to work with these two national aboriginal organizations, Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, and additional stakeholders to help identify and analyze legislative options.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1476167">These consultations, along with the findings of the ministerial representative received in 2007, and further discussions, have all informed and provided a firm foundation for Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476168">The solution before the House includes a mechanism for first nations to establish their own community specific matrimonial reserve property laws. This is particularly significant because it marks the first time that Parliament would recognize first nation laws in the area of matrimonial real property without qualification. There would be no ministerial powers on reserve and no opportunity for the minister to overturn first nation MRP laws.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476169">Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document> also honours calls to ensure that all first nations members have adequate input into the development of their communities' MRP laws. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476170">Under the terms of the proposed legislation, a majority of eligible voters must vote on and endorse proposed MRP laws. This approach would also help to align each MRP law with community values and traditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476171">The federal regime established by Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document> would apply to those first nations that have not already established MRP laws through negotiated self-government agreements that deal with the administration of reserve lands or through the First Nations Land Management Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476172">The federal regime would empower judges to order specific remedies, such as exclusive occupation orders. Under the legislation, first nations may make representations to the courts about the cultural, social and legal context relevant to most orders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476173">In accordance with what was heard during consultation sessions, the option of simply incorporating provincial or territorial laws regarding MRP to apply on reserves, which had been the subject of a private member's bill in an earlier Parliament, was discarded. Furthermore, non-members of a first nation would not be able to use the provisions of the proposed legislation to gain ownership of reserve lands.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476174">Finally, Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document> respects an opinion expressed repeatedly during the consultation sessions and featured prominently in the ministerial representative's final report, that the legislation must balance individual rights and the collective rights of first nation communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476175">Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document> proposes to fill an intolerable legislative gap that has existed for far too long. The solution contained in the legislation is both comprehensive and workable. It is the product of much research and consultation, and it responds to concerns and recommendations identified by the people likely to be most affected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476176">The proposed legislation offers a long overdue fix to an intolerable problem, and grants first nations the unprecedented power to develop their own laws in this area.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1476203">I am pleased to speak to Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8, An Act respecting family homes situated on First Nation reserves and matrimonial interests or rights in or to structures and lands situated on those reserves</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476204">The bill was designed to create a regime to govern how property interests of married and common-law couples on first nation reserves would be divided after a breakdown of their marriage, but the government, when introducing the bill, misled the House by claiming that it had the approval or it consulted all aboriginal groups.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476205">In my consultations with many native women's groups, both from Ontario and Quebec, they were appalled by the lack of consultation, the inflexibility of the consultation process and the fact that two large provinces that constitute over 50% of the aboriginal communities were left out of the consultation process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476206">We all know we do not question the need for legislation to address the very real problems when family breakdown occurs for Canadians living on reserves. However, the Conservative government failed in its constitutional duty to consult the aboriginal groups in the development of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476207">I am appalled by the fact that NDP claims it will support the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476208">I come from the colonial era so I know what colonialism is and I can see the Conservatives moving toward that era. However, for a party that claims to support human rights, I am absolutely appalled when women themselves claim that this would violate the Human Rights Act and they have given me a litany of articles that have been violated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476209">I cannot understand why anyone would stand up and support the bill. If we leave this proposal on the table, there cannot be substantive changes or discussions because we limit the ability of the aboriginal communities to discuss or make substantive changes. The bill needs to be hoisted for six months and we are calling on the government to do it so that it can use its time to properly consult without forcing its own opinions on a community that has not been consulted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476210">The Native Women's Association of Canada has stated that this is not the right bill. As I was listening to the presentations, I heard the NDP say that this would allow the Native Women's Association to present. However, if it presents and there is a violation, 60% of the recommendations of the Grant report have not been addressed, it demands that these aboriginal women who are living on the reserves need to have those amendments made, how can the government claim that it will be able to amend this bad bill? A bad bill has to be thrown out. Therefore, it is important that we do consult.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476211">Let us look at the history behind this. In 1986, during the era of the Mulroney Conservative government, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that when a conjugal relationship breaks down on reserves courts cannot apply provincial or territorial family law because reserve lands fall under federal jurisdiction. As a result, aboriginal women living on reserves have not enjoyed the same rights as women living off reserves. They are not entitled to an equal share of matrimonial property at the time of a marriage breakdown. Matrimonial real property, MRP, refers to the house or land that a couple lives on while they are married or in a common-law relationship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476212">Since the 1986 Supreme Court ruling, the gap in the law has had serious consequences. When a marriage or relationship ends, the courts have no authority to protect the MRP interests of spouses living on the reserve. As a result, spouses living on the reserves cannot ask the courts to grant an order for temporary or permanent possession of the family home even in a situation of domestic violence or when the spouse has custody of the children, or order partition or sale of the family home to enforce an order of compensation from one spouse or the other, or preclude a spouse from selling or mortgaging the family home without the consent of another spouse.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="30">(1330)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1476213">The Native Women's Association of Canada and the Assembly of First Nations have been highly critical of the bill. I would like to ask all parliamentarians to listen as they represent the majority of the groups. If we do not want to listen to them and impose a bill on them, then what are we here for? We are living in an ivory tower trying to impose laws on people who have not been consulted and this is a violation of the fundamental constitutional rights of the aboriginal people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476214">They strenuously argue that the government failed to live up to its constitutional duty to consult first nations on a law that would directly impact their right to manage reserve lands. There is a concern for the first nations women and girls who are four times more likely to be physically or sexually assaulted than any other women in Canada. Their suicide rate is three times the national average as is their likelihood of contracting AIDS. They are less healthy, poorer and more likely to have addiction problems. There cannot be another group in Canada more vulnerable and with fewer alternatives than women living on reserves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476215">Why is the government and those who are supporting this bill supporting keeping native women in the back rooms, poorer and uneducated? The bill does not address their rights nor does it address any of the socio-economic problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476216">In her report, the Auditor General stated that INAC, which did the consultation process, had no cultural sensitivity to the aboriginal communities and that the consultation that was done under INAC was not driven by consulting the larger groups of aboriginal communities. The “father knows best” is not an approach here. I think parliamentarians need to understand that when they bring in a bad bill they should have the will to apologize for the bad bill and withdraw it. Instead, they are putting themselves in a position of no return to the detriment of the aboriginal communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476217">Many first nations communities have come to us to say that it is contrary to the RCAP, which is the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, and that it violates their jurisdiction. They say that it is inconsistent with the inherent rights of self-government recognized in section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476218">First nations people have the right to exercise their jurisdiction and govern themselves without federal legislation. I heard from the NDP member that they would be given the right to put forward whatever bills they have, but the NDP misses the point. The first nations consent is also required. The federal government takes the position that it consulted with the Assembly of First Nations and Native Women's Association of Canada, however, the duty to consult cannot be delegated and the obligation rests with the federal government to consult the rights holders, first nations communities and their representatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476219">The other thing aboriginal groups have told us is that the bill violates the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and that Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document> blatantly violates the following sections: article 3, article 5, article 8, article 21, article 22, article 27, article 33 and article 34. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476220">With such a bad bill that has no support from any of the aboriginal communities, and I have the Grant report here, how does the government and the other opposition parties think that by sending the bill to committee they will be able to make any substantive changes? They will not.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1476225">That court decision was in 1986. If I remember correctly, the Liberals came back into office in 1993 and were there for the next 13 years.

It is up to first nations to identify gaps in laws and address them as they see fit by their own law-making initiatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476238">As it stands there is tremendous concern that Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document> will undermine grassroots action and increase the legislative gap, not eliminate it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476239">Wendy Grant-John, the ministerial representative, tabled a report in 2007 that stated, “Unilateral, imposed federal legislation was not the proper way to proceed”.

              <ParaText id="1476241">A second concern is that most first nations do not have the capacity to develop the local bylaws referred to in Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document>. More disturbing, however, is the fact that these local bylaws can only occur under a federally approved verification officer, a throwback to the Indian agent of the 1950s and wholly inconsistent with the inherent right to self-government.

              <ParaText id="1476243">Domestic violence is another serious issue that must be addressed as part of the search for solutions to matrimonial real property issues on reserves.

This increases the tax burden on the middle class and low wage earners. There are more than 72 places where this tax evasion is possible: the Caribbean, Jersey, Ghana, to name but a few. As a result states are being deprived of large amounts of revenue which could have been invested to improve the well-being of their population. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476304">While $11,000 billion is safely tucked away in these tax havens, the UN is calling for $50 billion over five years to eradicate world poverty. That amount is the equivalent of a scant 0.5% of those hidden billions. This special treatment of the most fortunate must stop. It is high time that this government followed the example of the Obama administration and passed legislation to effectively deal with the use of tax havens. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1476553">Without commenting on the merits of the bill, I submit that the bill must be accompanied by a royal recommendation because it would require new spending. Bill <Document DbId="3628552" Type="4">C-309</Document> would create a new agency of government and provide for the appointment of personnel. Clause 8 of Bill C-309 establishes the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Region of Northern Ontario as a separate and distinct agency of the Government of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476554">The requirement of a royal recommendation for organizational changes such as establishing a new agency is referred to in the Speaker's ruling of July 11, 1988, on two motions to amend Bill C-93, An Act for the preservation and enhancement of multiculturalism in Canada. The Speaker said that to establish a separate department of government “undoubtedly would cause a significant charge upon the federal treasury in order for the new department to function on a daily basis”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476555">When an almost identical bill was introduced in the first session of the 38th Parliament as Bill <Document DbId="1395862" Type="3">C-9, An Act to establish the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec</Document>, it was accompanied by a royal recommendation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476556">The second reason Bill <Document DbId="3628552" Type="4">C-309</Document> would require a royal recommendation is that it provides for the appointment of personnel. There are numerous precedents indicating that appointments must be accompanied by a royal recommendation. For example, on February 25, 2005, the Acting Speaker ruled that Bill <Document DbId="1461101" Type="4">C-280, An Act to amend the Employment Insurance Act (Employment Insurance Account and premium rate setting) and another Act in consequence</Document> required a royal recommendation because it provided for the appointment of 13 new commissioners to the Canada Employment Insurance Commission. The parent act specified that all commissioners were to receive remuneration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476557">Clauses 4 and 9 of Bill <Document DbId="3628552" Type="4">C-309</Document> provide for the establishment of advisory committees in the appointment of a president of the agency, positions that do not currently exist. Furthermore, the clauses explicitly state that the remuneration of the appointees shall be fixed by the Governor in Council. Provisions for salaries to be paid out of the consolidated revenue fund clearly impose a charge on the public treasury. I submit that clauses 4 and 9 would therefore require a royal recommendation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476558">Clause 13 of Bill <Document DbId="3628552" Type="4">C-309</Document> would also require the appointment of personnel, in this case, the officers and employees necessary for the proper conduct of the new agency. Although clause 13 does not specifically provide for the remuneration of these employees, the Speaker ruled on February 11, 2008 with respect to Bill <Document DbId="3075383" Type="4">C-474</Document>, the Federal Sustainable Development Act:</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1476580">Mr. Speaker, on December 13, 2006, Commissioner David Langtry stated, even before Bill C-11 was adopted, that full human rights protection was now being extended to all first nations people and that the commission would act quickly to open discussions with those communities on how best to implement this much-needed change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476581">To my knowledge, “discussions“ are not “consultations“. The government does not seem to have grasped the intent of this bill. I would like to quote a passage from a report of the Standing Committee on the Status of Women: </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476582">The committee heard and acknowledged that “the lack of a legal regime to govern the disposition of matrimonial real property on reserves is… the tip of a much greater iceberg“ and that “the legislative gap in respect of the matrimonial real property rights on reserve lands is exacerbated by chronic housing shortages that exist on most reserves and difficulties in securing financing to purchase or construct alternative housing on reserve…“</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476583">Because of this, women will continue to be forced to leave their communities while waiting for an effective solution to the housing shortage and the full implementation of the right to self-determination. The government fails to recognize this and remains apart from other countries by refusing to support the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. This situation has existed for two decades and has never been corrected. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476584">In June 2005, the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development tabled a report in the House. Its first finding recognized the importance of the matter of matrimonial real property to the residents of reserves, and, specifically, first nations women and children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476585">The committee recognized the great complexity of the issues. It also realized that, while immediate action was required, it was imperative that all recommendations be consistent with the government’s recognition of the inherent right of self-government by recognizing first nations’ authority over on-reserve matrimonial real property. The committee felt that any action needed to be taken in consultation and collaboration with first nations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476586">That was in 2005. Today, because the bill was neither developed in consultation with first nations as they wished, nor referred to the committee before second reading, the Assembly of First Nations considers that it has been so botched that it is practically impossible to put it right after this second reading. In addition, the impact studies conducted on the communities affected by Bill<Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document>and the measures they contain to encourage the development of the communities' own laws on matrimonial homes have not been submitted to either the Assembly of First Nations or the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development. The Assembly of First Nations and the Native Women's Association of Canada want the bill to be defeated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476587">Like the Native Women's Association of Canada and the Assembly of First Nations, the Bloc Québécois agrees with the idea of this bill, but not with its content or the way in which it has been put together. We feel that it is critically important for the communities and, for that reason, it should have been studied. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476588">What difference is there between Bill C-44, which became Bill C-21, and Bill C-289, which is now Bill C-8? For me, there is no difference except that Bills C-44 and C-289 died on the order paper, and in all cases there were no prior consultations. They also have in common the almost unanimous protest against the method in which they were drawn up and the non-aboriginal view of aboriginal real property. I say “almost unanimous“ because the only person not in agreement at the time is now a senator. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476589">This bill, like the ones that went before and the ones that will come after, should have been the result of consultations with first nations, as agreed by the Martin government and the first nations in May 2005. For this bill in particular, the provinces, the territories, the committees of Parliament and the report of Wendy Grant-John, the ministerial representative for matrimonial real property issues on reserve, all should have been consulted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476590">Unfortunately, this was not the case. The few consultations that were held left participants bitter. They saw them as charades at which they wasted their time. None of their recommendations were accepted, yet the implementation has to be done within their culture and under their administration. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1476591">This government should perhaps mention that this bill resulted from discussions with some first nations organizations, the ministerial representative, the provinces and the territories in the summer and fall of 2007. The government should not use the term “consultation“ at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476592">Once more, the Native Women's Association of Canada, the Assembly of First Nations and the Assembly of the First Nations of Quebec and Labrador oppose this bill because it is fundamentally flawed and practically impossible to correct after second reading. In June 2006, in its report to the House, the Standing Committee on the Status of Women wished to see concrete progress on the issues relating to matrimonial real property rights of first nations women, issues linked to violence against women. It quoted Beverly Jacobs from the Native Women's Association of Canada:</ParaText>

They do not want to see these errors corrected by another that would be just as serious, if not more so, than the existing one. This error must be corrected on their terms and in a way that is consistent with their lifestyle and their culture. Above all this legislation must not be the outcome of a unilateral decision by the federal government, which has increasingly demonstrated its ignorance of aboriginal values and of the non-legislative measures inherent in the enforcement of any act or regulation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476596">There are many irritants. I will mention some of them. First, no non-legislative measure is mentioned. Second, there is a lack of information with regard to the implementation of an action plan. Third, there is also information missing as to resources available to the first nations to develop their laws or the regulations of Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document>. Fourth, as mentioned previously, there is a crying need for housing. This situation is in itself sufficient to make this bill's provisions unworkable. Indeed, how, in the case of marital breakdown, can one guarantee decent housing to each of the parties in question? Fifth, this legislation refers to legal proceedings that will lead to trials to clarify the bill's ambiguities. Most of the members of these communities cannot undertake such legal proceedings, because they cannot afford them.</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The common functions of provincial and territorial matrimonial property law are, firstly, defining what personal and real property of spouses is considered matrimonial property within a given jurisdiction; providing a system of rights and protections in relation to matrimonial property on a mandatory basis to married couples; and thirdly, establishing—as all jurisdictions do—a legal presumption of equal division of matrimonial property on marriage breakdown, regardless of which spouse owns the matrimonial property. This last function usually means that a compensation order can be issued by the court, requiring one spouse to pay the other an amount of money to achieve an equal division of matrimonial property—and the couple's assets and liabilities that constitute matrimonial property are taken into account in determining this.</QuotePara>

Some jurisdictions have passed family violence legislation that provides a package of remedies, including interim orders respecting matrimonial real property. Other jurisdictions do not have specific legislation addressing family violence.

              <ParaText id="1476648">My concern in all the developments today on this bill is that we are losing sight of the objective. The objective is that we have a legislative vacuum. There are vulnerable people, families and children, who are not covered by any legislation. When there is a marital or common-law breakdown on reserve, this is a problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476649">I very much appreciated the question posed by the member for <Affiliation DbId="128543" Type="2">Simcoe North</Affiliation> just a minute ago to the Bloc member, because the bill encourages the development of marital breakdown laws at the band level, and it can be done without any requirement or need for ministerial sign-off. Right now, unless first nations are under a self-government agreement, this is very problematic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476650">As we know, there are 630 bands in Canada. So we need to be concerned about that. Somebody has to take leadership, and the government is taking that leadership. This is what concerns me so much about the hoist motion by the Liberal Party on this bill, because the adoption of the hoist amendment would have the same effect as killing the bill. That is simply inappropriate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476651">This legislation is the product of a comprehensive process of consultation, collaboration and compromise. Officials from key stakeholder groups, including the Assembly of First Nations, the Native Women's Association of Canada, the first nations' Lands Advisory Board, the provinces and the territories, actively participated in the process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476652">We keep hearing that there was no meaningful consultation. There was $1.7 million provided to the Assembly of First Nations regarding consultation on this issue. There was $1.7 million provided to the Native Women's Association of Canada for further consultation on this issue. There were moneys provided to other aboriginal organizations for consultations on this issue. There were consultations in more than 100 jurisdictions across Canada on the need for this type of legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476653">On the very same day, the aboriginal affairs committee heard testimony from witnesses who congratulated the government on its approach to drafting the legislation on the Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act, and by the way, we approached the drafting of this bill in the same way. We were given kudos for the way we handled it in the Cree-Naskapi amendments and we are being criticized for handling it in the very same way on Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document>, the bill we are talking about regarding matrimonial real property.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476654">So I am finding the position of particularly the Liberal Party to be very inconsistent in terms of its approach in this Parliament. However, its approach is very consistent. It fought all the way on the human rights amendments to the legislation in the last Parliament by which our first nations brothers and sisters were put under the Canadian Human Rights Act, the same as other Canadians. That was firmly opposed by the Liberal Party in the House, and now it is doing, in my opinion, the very same thing. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1476656">The NDP and the Bloc are much more realistic in that they want to debate it and have witnesses at committee. I think that is most appropriate, and we would like to do that too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476657">Maybe it would help to explain a little bit of the complexity of what is going on, why Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document> is so necessary in the context of people living on reserves and the legal complexities at play.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476658"> To begin, the bill only addresses interests or rights regarding family homes on reserves and other matrimonial interests or rights in or to structures or lands on reserves. It does not address other matrimonial property, including items such as furniture, cars and off-reserve properties, as provincial and territorial family laws apply to such property.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476659">It is also imperative to have a basic grasp of one unique legal aspect of reserve lands, and that is the collective interest. Under the Indian Act, reserve lands are held collectively and are set aside for the use and benefit of a first nation. In the rest of Canada, land holdings are primarily based on individual ownership. Other legal concepts such as rights, title and interests, must be interpreted in light of the first nations collective interest in land on reserves. All these concepts can come into play when on-reserve couples separate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476660">Along with the collective interest in reserve land, many houses and other structures on reserves are often communally owned. According to most estimates, up to three-quarters of all on-reserve housing units are owned collectively. Occupants typically rent space in the units from first nation councils. In some cases, individuals purchase or build a house on first nation property. It varies greatly from one community to another. I know communities where 100% of the housing is actually individually owned. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476661">First nation membership often adds another level of complexity. All members of the first nation have an interest in community-owned lands and properties. When married couples living on reserves separate, these and other factors complicate the division of property and interests, of course. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476662">Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document> proposes a clear set of rules to address this complex matter. Under this legislation, couples living on reserves would be able to access a range of rights and remedies similar to those available to couples living off-reserve, through a provisional federal regime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476663">The bill also contains provisions for first nations to create their own regimes, to adopt laws governing the use, occupation and possession of family homes, for instance, along with other on-reserve matrimonial interests and rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476664">Members of the House know all too well that this legislative gap has continued far too long. Legislation in this area is long overdue. The provisional federal regime included in Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document> addresses pertinent issues that, along with other changes, will grant spouses living on reserves an equal right to occupy the family home, prevent one spouse from selling or mortgaging the on-reserve family home without the consent of the other spouse, enable a court to issue emergency protection and exclusive occupation orders on an urgent basis, particularly in instances of domestic violence, and ensure that divorced or separated spouses share equally in the proven value of matrimonial interests and on-reserve properties, including family homes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476665">Furthermore, when a spouse or common-law partner dies, Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document> will enable the surviving spouse to occupy the family home for a specified period of time and to apply for half the value of matrimonial interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476666">Finally, in cases where both spouses have signed written agreements on these matters, the legislation will enable the court to enforce these agreements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476667">This legislation protects not only the rights of individuals, but also the collective rights of first nations. With the exception of emergency protection and confidentiality orders, whenever an application is made under the bill, the first nation may make representation to the courts about the cultural, social and legal context relevant to the proceedings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476668">Finally, the proposed legislation also includes provisions for the enactment of community-specific laws in this area. Consistent with the democratic process, the first nation members must support the proposed law through a community ratification vote before it can become a first nation law. As I explained earlier, this can all occur and is enabled by this legislation without ratification by the minister. The minister is not involved, assuming the bill is adopted.</ParaText>

Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document> would have a positive and tangible effect in first nations communities.

This is something that we must think quite seriously about because we know from the consultation process that many individuals with serious concerns would support this initiative. The vulnerable individuals in the communities, however, are very reluctant to support this important bill when their leaders and aboriginal organizations are taking an opposite view. However, those are the very people we need to be concerned about. We cannot let the objective of the legislation be lost because we are having a political discourse as opposed to one that concerns itself very directly with the well-being and welfare of individuals.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1476678">Madam Speaker, I am absolutely astounded that the government continues to suggest that somehow the bill, which is fundamentally flawed in its principles and in the underpinnings of the legislative items within the bill, should go to committee where some amendments can be made, as the member said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476679">The process in this place is that once a bill passes second reading, we are giving approval in principle to the principles and the fundamental principles. If members have ever tried to change the intent of legislation at committee, they know they will be out of order. It cannot be done at committee, which is precisely why AFN has called, not only for this bill to be defeated, but to be withdrawn even before second reading. It had the same position on Bill C-47 in the last Parliament. It said that this bill does not work, that it cannot be repaired and that we had to start again with proper consultation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476680">Some consultations did take place by the government's own consultant but 85% of the recommendations of the government's own consultant were rejected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476681">The issue here is that there is not one first nations group anywhere that supports this bill. The government must recognize that there is a problem and that it cannot go forward and force this bill upon Parliament or first nations when it is so fundamentally flawed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476682">I have a question for the parliamentary secretary. What benefit is it to impose a bill on first nations when there is an understanding that there has been no meaningful consultation and nothing has happened since the last Parliament when the AFN passed a resolution to have the bill withdrawn? What benefit is it to have the minister come before the House, give a 15 minute speech and say that there was comprehensive consultations and then leave the Chamber and not come back to face questions in the House?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476683">What kind of consultation is that? What is the perception of the AFN and first nations across the country when the minister himself is not prepared to stand in front of Parliament and answer important questions on a very important bill?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1476688">The parliamentary secretary to the minister said very clearly that there were 103 consultations and that millions of dollars were spent consulting the broader community.

              <ParaText id="1476701">Madam Speaker, I am very proud to participate in this debate. It is an issue which is very close to my heart and my political past, present and future, if I may put it that way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476702">I had the good fortune to be a member of the House when the question of the patriation of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms was before the House. I realize, looking around at some of the younger members in the House, that may strike them as a remarkably long time ago. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476703">I had the opportunity to be present when the historic amendments were presented to the patriation bill, which advanced the cause of aboriginal self-government, by recognizing that the Constitution that was being adopted by the House could not take away from or deviate from existing treaty and other relationships between Canada's aboriginal people and the Government of Canada. That was accepted by the House and became a very important feature that allowed patriation to take place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476704">Subsequently, I became a member of the provincial legislature in Ontario and, as such, was very proud to have been able to participate in discussions around very important first nations issues that were discussed at Meech Lake and in Charlottetown. When I had the honour of becoming premier, I spent the first year of my mandate negotiating with the aboriginal chiefs in Ontario a statement of relationship between the Government of Ontario, and the nation-to-nation understanding that we were determined to reach between the Government of Ontario, and the first nations and aboriginal people of the province.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476705">I do not come to this debate without a certain degree of history attached to its importance. After listening to the comments that have been made about the bill, I wonder really where everyone has been because the whole direction of public policy, affirmed very strongly in the report of the royal commission which was appointed by Prime Minister Mulroney, has been to recognize that we need a new relationship between the first nations people and the Government of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476706">That relationship has to be one based on a profound mutual respect. It has to be based on a different and renewed understanding of the importance of the principle of self-government, what that means and entails, and we have to abandon the paternalism that is entrenched, seeps through and permeates the Indian Act. We have to move beyond that to a new relationship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476707">We have been able to do that in a number of situations and circumstances where new treaties have been signed and negotiated, but it must be said that since the defeat of the Charlottetown accord we have not been able to make the kind of progress in self-government discussions, which certainly I would have hoped and argued for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476708">I want to say in all sincerity to the parliamentary secretary, who has presented this afternoon the case for the bill and against the hoist motion which has been proposed by the Liberal Party, that I do not look upon this as a partisan issue. I really do not. I do not see this as an issue which, as he says, he does not want to see become politicized.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476709">The whole question that is being discussed is not one that can be subject to an easy formula. When he says, for example, that this is as a result of the government's determination to do something on behalf of the most vulnerable, it is the phrase “on behalf of” about which we have to think through its implications. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476710">Everyone in the House has to understand that if we are to take government-to-government relationships seriously, and I feel this very strongly as a member of Parliament, it means that I do not have a right to pass legislation that applies to first nations people and to first nations reserves unless that legislation has the full support of the people on whose behalf it is being proposed.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1476711">We have to abandon the kind of paternalism that unfortunately underlies this legislation. It simply is not possible at this time in our history for us to take this kind of approach. I know it is difficult. I know it is frustrating. I know it is costly. The parliamentary secretary has spent some time focusing on how much money was involved in consulting with the first nations people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476712">All I can say is, I want to see clear evidence that the legislation has the full support of the first nations governments of this country, has the full support of the first nations, those who are responsible within the first nations community and those who have a strong position, those people who sat across the table from me at Charlottetown, and those organizations which were represented on an equal basis sitting with us throughout the negotiations on the Charlottetown accord.

              <ParaText id="1476716">I am disappointed that my colleagues in the New Democratic Party and in the Bloc Québécois do not take the same position. I am particularly disappointed because, knowing the history of those parties and knowing the position that they have taken on the question of self-government, knowing that it was the leader of the New Democratic Party in 1980 who moved the amendments to the patriation act that in fact ensured that treaty rights were recognized fully in the Constitution, knowing of the long history of Parti Québécois governments in the province of Quebec with respect to the importance of recognizing nation-to-nation relationships, and knowing the sensitivity of the Bloc Québécois to any notion of paternalism from those coming from outside, determining what is right and what is wrong, then I am doubly surprised, not shocked, but surprised. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1476721">It goes on at some length to describe the reasons why they are opposed to the legislation, not that they have concerns about it, not that they want it to go to committee, but that they oppose it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476722">I have to say to my colleagues in the New Democratic Party that this will be the first time, certainly in my recollection, in which that party has voted to take a position with respect to an approach to legislation that is completely contrary to the leadership and to the membership of the organizations on whose behalf the legislation is being proposed.

This, from a government which has refused to ratify the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, is a complete contradiction. I have never heard a good word about the United Nations coming from across the way with respect to any of its approaches to human rights, and on this one issue he picks some kind of report out of context and says that this is what we are supposed to do,.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476725">I sincerely believe that if we are to take self-government seriously, that means not simply that we consult and say, “Thanks very much for your point of view, but we will go ahead and do this anyway”, but it means that we have to respond in a different way. We believe on this side of the House, in the Liberal Party, very strongly that measures such as these can only be taken if they have the full support and approval of those who are responsible, in leadership positions, in the first nations and aboriginal communities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1476726"> The parliamentary secretary said that some of the reason for this opposition was what he called “politics”. If he is saying that the leadership of the AFN has some kind of agenda, which does not allow it to support the legislation, he should tell us what he thinks that agenda is. I do not believe it is necessarily the case. He says that someone has to provide the leadership, that it can only come from the federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476727">This again repeats the same kind of paternalist thinking that has so bedevilled the discussion about aboriginal rights and the position of aboriginal people in Canada. The question of aboriginal property, the question of matrimonial property is difficult. The first problem is there are not enough people who have housing on native reserves. There are not enough people who are sufficiently housed to cope with the existing situation.</ParaText>

She was saying that unless the government came forward with a full package that was effectively negotiated with those people who were being effective, what the government wanted to do would not even happen. The people the government points to as “the most vulnerable” will not be protected. This issue has to be addressed by the government.</ParaText>

Today more of that is happening than even at the time of the residential schools question. With respect to what is happening to aboriginal first nations families on reserve, there is a greater crisis today than perhaps there was in the 1950s and 1960s.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476732">I know there is a certain point of view that would say that by passing this legislation, the House will begin to address some of these questions. I do not believe that for one second and neither does the leadership of the AFN, neither does the leadership of the Native Women's Association and neither does the AFN women's council. They are right. Those issues require a comprehensive discussion, negotiation and resolution between the Government of Canada and the native leadership with respect to those issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476733">The AFN is being forced to go in front of the Human Rights Commission in order to argue the case that there is discriminatory funding as between what is happening to families on-reserves and what is happening to families off-reserve. These questions need to be resolved. This legislation does not resolve it. Nor does it touch it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476734">For my friends in the Bloc and the NDP who say let us get this legislation into committee and we will deal with it, the answer is no they will not. They will have to deal with the measures in front of them. They will have to deal with the legislation which the government has presented, which has a certain approach, a certain philosophy and a certain direction. That direction is to go the provincial courts and get the issues settled there and give the provincial courts the mandate and the mechanisms to deal with the problems that exist on-reserve with respect to family breakdown and the matrimonial home. In the current circumstance I do not think that will work. It will not work without a much greater degree of thought and resolution of the question than has been presented by the government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1476752">I think my colleague across the way from Simcoe, whom I have known for a long time, said that we take our obligations under sections 15 and 28 seriously. If the hon. members goes back and looks at the debates that took place in 1979, 1980 and 1981, we wrestled with the question of the balances between self-government and sections 15 and 28. Those debates will go on long after the hon. member from Simcoe and I gone. They will continue and that is a healthy thing in a constitutional democracy.</ParaText>

My problem is it is a question of how seriously we take self-government. If we take it seriously, we have to listen to the people who tell us not to pass the bill. We have to listen to the ministerial representative who has said that there are all kinds of ancillary questions and all kinds of other questions that have to be dealt with properly, but they will not be if the bill is passed in its current framework.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1476769">I was in the House earlier when I heard our member for <Affiliation DbId="128650" Type="2">Nanaimo—Cowichan</Affiliation>, who is the aboriginal affairs critic for the NDP, lay out the concerns we have with the bill, but she also laid out the concerns we have with the hoist motion. In the back and forth exchange that goes on in the House, it was actually rather disappointing to hear what came from Liberal members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476770"> I cannot think of any other member in the House who has worked harder on aboriginal affairs than the member for <Affiliation DbId="128650" Type="2">Nanaimo—Cowichan</Affiliation>, not only in her own community but across the country. She is a strong advocate for aboriginal people and brings forward their issues to this Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476771">To hear from Liberal members that by supporting the bill we are denying the rights of aboriginal people was, frankly, very perplexing and makes me wonder what kind of political agenda is going on here. The issue we have is with the hoist motion and what it would do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476772">In terms of the bill that is before us on matrimonial real property, as the member earlier outlined, it is an issue that has been outstanding for decades. The treatment of aboriginal people is really a black mark on Canadian history, and the fact that so much has been left undone. We arrive at points of crisis in so many communities, whether it is around housing, water, education or self-governance, because we have not paid attention to these issues over so long a time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476773">I actually remember the debate in the House of Commons on the Nisga'a treaty, which was the first modern-day treaty in the province of British Columbia with a first nation. I remember the clash with the Conservatives, who were then the opposition, who opposed the bill. There were hundreds of amendments. We spent 72 hours going through those amendments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476774">The clash was over the issue of individual rights, property rights and collective rights. There was a fundamental lack of understanding by the Conservatives at the time, who could not agree to a treaty that did not enshrine individual property rights. It showed a lack of understanding about the history of first nations people on this land and it showed a lack of sensitivity about the traditions, values, practices and processes that have built up over thousands of years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476775">So it is interesting that here we are again today debating this issue, which again involves fundamental rights and recognition of aboriginal practices and history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476776">It is clear, though, that there is a very serious issue here. There is no guarantee or insurance that the equality and rights of women are being upheld in the aboriginal community. We see difficult situations. We see situations of poverty and of violence. They are systemic and long-standing. I would agree that this legislation is not going to fix all those things. Nevertheless we have to recognize that at some point there has to be a process and a place where these issues will be dealt with. </ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The basic scheme of the Act would be a concurrent jurisdiction model with paramountcy of First Nations law where there is inconsistency or conflict with either federal or provincial law with respect to matrimonial property. In this regard, the maximum scope of lawmaking responsibility should be left to First Nations’ jurisdiction and federal activity should be as minimal as required to meet human rights concerns.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="1476782">The observations contained in this report that were left largely unaddressed by the government are very important considerations as we deal with this bill. We are now at the critical point of deciding what is to be done. We have a bill before us and the Liberals have moved a hoist motion, which I find surprising. If that is their response to the bill, it is removing this critical issue that needs to be dealt with from the legislative process. A hoist motion is just that: It takes the bill out. It is gone forever, for all intents and purposes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476783">We in the NDP find this very perplexing and think a preferable course of action would be to recognize that this bill is flawed, and again, the NDP member for <Affiliation DbId="128650" Type="2">Nanaimo—Cowichan</Affiliation> was absolutely clear on that this morning. She laid out some of the difficulties with this bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476784">It is the process that is important here. We want to ensure there is a process that will produce an outcome that creates the public space for the Native Women's Association of Canada, the AFN, local groups and other organizations to be able to talk about this bill and actually articulate what needs to be done, based in part, I am sure, on the conclusions and recommendations that came from the ministerial representative I just quoted. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476785">From a practical point of view, we have a lot of concern about a motion that will, in effect, shut down debate on this issue. It is up to the committee to hear testimony from organizations that are directly involved, to hear directly from first nations and to change the bill. The committee may decide at that point that the bill should go. That is a mandate of a committee, to look at that legislation and decide what needs to be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476786">We need to take that step, allow the space to be created and ensure that this debate does not get halted and that we do not just hoist the issue out of the air and say, “That is that end of that. We hope the government will bring it back and we are going to put some pressure on them”. The fact is that we are in a legislative process right now. We have the opportunity to make sure that people are heard and to come to the right conclusions about what we are hearing. That is the important point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476787">I take great offence not so much to the comments that were made by the member for <Affiliation DbId="128246" Type="2">Toronto Centre</Affiliation> a little while ago, but some of the comments made earlier by the Liberal members debating this bill and equating the fact that, because we do not support their hoist motion, somehow we are opposed to aboriginal rights, that we are not upholding the rights of women and that we do not want to deal with this issue. Nothing could be further from the truth. I find it quite offensive that this line would be taken. In effect, it has now politicized the issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476788">Again, as the member for <Affiliation DbId="128650" Type="2">Nanaimo—Cowichan</Affiliation> said earlier this afternoon, let us not politicize this issue. Let us work with people in a real way, bring in the representatives of first nations and have an intelligence discussion. Let us look at the bill and recognize the fundamental flaws it has.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476789">I have been reading some of the material from the Native Women's Association of Canada and I know that even in my own community in east Vancouver there are very strong arguments that need to be spoken to in terms of the fact that there have not been even short-term programs and policies enacted that would deal with the serious situation facing women and children with regard to family breakup and the separation of children.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1476790">Every day in my community in east Vancouver, I see people come off reserve into the urban environment seeking jobs and housing. They find a situation where life is very difficult and where the programs, the supports and the work environment are not there. We are now facing a tragedy in many communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476791">I would agree with the Native Women's Association of Canada. They make it very clear that the practical yet critical issues of violence, poverty, chronic shortage of houses, lack of shelters and second stage housing in communities must be addressed on a priority basis. I absolutely agree. We should be using every avenue we have to do that. In fact, we should be using the bill to draw attention to it. If we can get it into committee, we can focus and highlight the tension on some of these issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476792">We heard a report today from Stats Canada about the incredible increase in the number of women who are using emergency shelters. Most of these shelters are completely overburdened. This is happening today, and it is very alarming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476793">To think about these issues, to take action and to use the powers we have as members of Parliament, to use the legislative process to the fullest capacity we can to put the spotlight on the bill, to point out those significant flaws and to point out the inadequacies of the bill and what needs to be done is where we should be going.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476794">Here we are debating a hoist motion, and we are accusing each other of this and that. I really hope that if the bill does go through on second reading and it goes to committee that the Liberal members will pay full attention to ensuring the debate happens and that witnesses come forward so we can work together and put pressure on the Conservative government to do the right thing. I think that is very critical.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476795">A number of years ago, as the housing critic for the NDP, I travelled across the country and looked at housing situations. I was very familiar with housing in the urban environment and the homelessness that was increasing at that time. Of course, it is still a serious question. I also went to a lot of smaller communities, including in northern Manitoba.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476796">One of the most shocking things I saw was in northern Manitoba. It was not the only place. There are other remote communities on reserve where the housing was so appalling that I could see the gap between the window and the frame and the weather coming in. People did not even have running water or sanitary facilities. I could not believe my eyes. I thought I had seen the worst housing possible in places like the downtown eastside. It was only when I went north and saw housing on reserve that I began to understand how serious the situation was with first nations people living in deep poverty in third world conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476797">The worst of it was that this housing was built by CMHC. This was actually government built housing that was meant to be safe and adequate for families. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476798">I remember meeting family members. I met a mother in Churchill who told me her child had been taken away by the family services because she was homeless. It was not because she was a bad mother; it was because she was homeless. She was living in a shelter, she was couch surfing, and her kid was taken away.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476799">In my own community, this is a very familiar story. It is almost like a new kind of residential school. Children are taken away because the resources are not there to support the family. The number of children being taken away from aboriginal families is very alarming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476800">Those are all issues that are underlying the bill. I would certainly agree with some of the comments that have been made today by Liberal members and others. That is what we have to address. The question remains how we address it and where one begins. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="55">(1655)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1476801">I think we have to begin with the powers we have. We have to use those powers in a way that is responsible and in a way that people who are impacted by this debate, first nations, are actually participating in that debate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476802">The way to do that is to send this bill to committee and hear from those folks. The committee will then make a determination as to whether the bill is to be amended and whether changes can be made that are satisfactory. Based on the testimony they hear, the committee may make another decision. I really hope the Liberals will support that if this bill goes to committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476803">As I understand it, by supporting the hoist motion we will in effect be abandoning this issue. We will be abandoning the legislative process that is open to us to focus on this very important issue of matrimonial real property. We will be shutting out voices that need to be heard. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476804">We will be saying that we will just keep the pressure up and it will be dealt with. That means another 23 years will probably go by. It was 23 years ago that the Supreme Court of Canada made it clear that new laws needed to be enacted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476805">There has been so much time that has gone by. We need to ask if there was so much concern about this issue from the Liberal members why nothing was done during their term in office. This issue went on and on. It was unattended to, and here we are today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476806">I feel we are taking a responsible course of action. We are making a responsible decision. For others in this House to go after our members and say we do not care or we do not support this issue is really quite outrageous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476807">I would like to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="128650" Type="2">Nanaimo—Cowichan</Affiliation> for the amount of work she has done in bringing this and other issues into the House. She has been tireless in that effort. I know that members of the Bloc are also hopeful that this bill will get to committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476808">Her only goal, our only goal, and we would hope the goal of other members in the House, is to make sure these issues are addressed and not abandoned as they have been year after year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476809">That is where we are. There is a lot more work to be done. The House will be recessing sometime in June. I think it is very important to begin that discussion with first nations, women's organizations and the parties affected to begin a genuine process to figure out whether the bill is to be changed or defeated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476810">That has to be done at committee. That is what is open to us, and that is what we should be using.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1476813">Right now they are actually hamstrung by the Indian Act in ways that others cannot even hope to imagine.

It is a huge obstruction to aboriginal communities being able to develop and become economic masters of their future.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1476817">The NDP has always stood up for the implementation of first nations governance. We have always supported that, and we have supported accelerating the treaty process. However, how that is done is very important. If the Indian Act is to be just thrown out, I think the key is that it is not done in the way that was contemplated by the Liberal government but in a consultative manner. Whether it is this bill or the Indian Act as a whole, it has to be a fair and just process that includes people so the outcome is actually going to serve those communities.</ParaText>

I was involved in some of the committee hearings around the legislation. At that time, the minister, supported by the government of the day, brought forward four bills.

We are debating these same issues today about violence, safety, homelessness, lack of housing, poverty, and lack of rights that we were debating eight or nine years ago, going back to the court decision in 1986, and 100-plus years ago. That is the tragedy of this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476822">The NDP wants to focus on a process that is right, that involves people, that gives space in a committee for voices to be heard so that we can get this bill right or throw it out if it is wrong.</ParaText>

One is to make sure there is equal funding for aboriginal children versus non-aboriginal children. Right now there is a huge discrepancy in funding. This is deplorable, because kids cannot have access to the resources they need to get the education they require if there is such a huge difference in funding. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476825">Second, there are places like Attawapiskat where the conditions are so bad that kids are freezing in their schools. How can they possibly learn when they are wearing parkas and they are frozen to the bone? Other communities, like mine, in Pacheedaht, have been on boil water advisories for huge chunks of time. The Department of Indian and Northern Affairs ignores their requests repeatedly. How can one have communities on Vancouver Island where they do not have access to potable water? It is absolutely remarkable.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1476832">I want first to demonstrate that, under the able stewardship of the member for <Affiliation DbId="128543" Type="2">Simcoe North</Affiliation> as chair of the aboriginal affairs committee, the committee has been demonstrating exemplary cooperation. I see him nodding his head in agreement. We have had the opportunity to deal with two bills already.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1476833">Those bills were Bill <Document DbId="3629244" Type="3">C-5, An Act to amend the Indian Oil and Gas Act</Document>, and Bill <Document DbId="3831702" Type="3">C-28</Document>, this very day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476834">In both cases, the government bills were supported by representatives of the aboriginal communities and the responsible bodies concerned with the issues involved. They appeared before us. In one of the two cases, the bill was tweaked slightly with government consent. That was done unanimously. Today, a minor amendment was made to Bill C-28, and the bill was passed without much discussion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476835">I raise this point for two reasons. First, to demonstrate that, as far as the official opposition is concerned—and I dare say in this instance also of the two other parties in opposition —there is a desire for cooperation and for doing things properly. The other reason is also very important. In both cases, the bills passed in committee after being passed here at second reading had the unconditional support of the aboriginal communities. That is not the case for Bill C-8, and I feel that needs to be said. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1476836"> I want to talk about the process for awhile. Parliament is a wonderful thing. It shows flexibility, ingenuity and a way sometimes of dealing with things in different ways, to improve our ways, to make sure that people are heard, to make sure people have an opportunity to express themselves in respect of an overall democratic will.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476837">This is the 40th Parliament. In the 39th Parliament what I am going to talk about happened three times and in the 38th Parliament, which is where it started in earnest, it happened quite often. I am talking about referral of a government bill to committee before second reading. This is something we must consider very carefully.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476838">In a minority Parliament in particular, that means that before a bill is adopted at second reading, it is referred to a committee. The government can do that on its own. It can determine that a bill will go to committee after five hours of debate whether the opposition parties want it to or not. The difference between referring a bill to committee before second reading or after second reading is very important. After second reading the House has stated its approval in principle of what is contained in the bill. Amendments are very restricted in nature. They can constrain, or they can orient a little more precisely certain things, but they cannot expand. Therefore, the capacity of a committee to change a bill is very different if the bill is adopted and referred to committee after second reading as opposed to being referred to committee before second reading. That is crucial for a number of reasons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476839">That was done over 30 times in the 38th Parliament. I thought that demonstrated a willingness to engage parliamentarians of all parties in shaping legislation. Beyond that, it involved the witnesses and those interested in the legislation as they came to committee because it gave a wider range to parliamentarians in effect to give shape to the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476840">In the 39th Parliament, it happened three times. In this Parliament it has not happened yet. In the 39th Parliament and this Parliament, even though at times opposition members recommended and the House approved the notion that bills be referred to committee before second reading in order to have that flexibility, that capacity to engage the witnesses, to really engage the expertise in the country to shape legislation as a better expression of the common will, it has not been happening. It has not happened a single time in this Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476841"> I know my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128543" Type="2">Simcoe North</Affiliation> knows what I am talking about because I brought this up at committee. It is an act of respect of Parliament for a minority government to ask that legislation be referred to committee before second reading. It gives the ability of all members on that committee to bring a constructiveness to it. It gives an opportunity to all witnesses to be taken seriously, and perhaps to suggest amendments. It engages all kinds of NGOs. It engages academia. It engages the private sector. In this case it certainly would have engaged the aboriginal communities across the land, the same aboriginal communities that have said they are not supportive of Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476842"> I was listening very closely to my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128246" Type="2">Toronto Centre</Affiliation> and my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128755" Type="2">Ottawa Centre</Affiliation> and they were not contradicting each other. My colleague from Ottawa Centre said we should send it to committee where we could amend it and I totally agree with him. Let us send it to committee where the committee can do some real work and shape this legislation and have the witnesses engage in shaping it so that it becomes a constructive exercise and not a confrontation exercise as it might turn out to be if we do it this way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476843">That is why the motion to defer the matter for six months would give the government an opportunity to consider seriously consulting widely. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1476844">Honestly, I would have preferred if the government had chosen to send the bill to committee before second reading. I do not think we would be having this debate. The committee is working very well. It could have demonstrated to Canadians its capacity to do so. It could have engaged the aboriginal community in a very thorough manner, taking whatever time was needed, having as many meetings as were needed in order to listen to proposals and suggestions. The committee has demonstrated that ability and it could have demonstrated it even more so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476845">Because the government chose not to do that, we are now caught in the situation where our party, I think very legitimately, is saying that because the Assembly of First Nations and the Native Women's Association of Canada are saying they do not like the bill, we should hoist it. The hoist motion calls for a delay of six months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476846"> If the government would step back and consider that perhaps the bill should have been referred to committee before second reading, this would all be over. The committee has demonstrated its capacity to work, to fully engage in a very serious matter. It could engage all the witnesses that want to be engaged in a constructive legislative exercise. Unfortunately, because the government chose not to refer the bill to committee before second reading, we are into the current situation.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1476847">Once again, I would ask my Bloc Québécois and NDP colleagues to consider one point very seriously. We are not opposed to sending this bill to committee. However, we would like the committee responsible for studying it to have the kind of freedom that it cannot have if the bill goes to committee after second reading. That is crucial.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476848">From what I can tell, today and for some time now, we have been getting very clear signals from aboriginals, from the Assembly of First Nations, from the Native Women's Association of Canada and other stakeholders. Personally, as a member of the committee, I have heard from a lot of people. They are very concerned about this bill, about how it was written, about what it contains, and about what it does not contain. If we have to restrict ourselves to a more limited range of amendments because the House has passed this bill at second reading, we will end up limiting Parliament's ability to do good work. I suggest that my colleagues give that some serious thought.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476849">If—all together—we do tell the government that we want to do this work, that is fine, but let us do it with the latitude, flexibility and desire to be constructive that this committee has demonstrated so far. All of the committee members, whether they represent the NDP, the Bloc, the Liberals or the Conservatives, have demonstrated good will and the ability to work well together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476850">I had hoped that the government would seize this opportunity to try to resolve, once and for all, a problem that has been around for years, even decades, to resolve it constructively, which a minority government or Parliament can do if it so chooses. That would have been a strong indication of the government's respect for Parliament and for aboriginal communities in Canada. Unfortunately, that does not seem to be the case. We believe that we should not proceed with the bill as written. Aboriginal communities are not happy with it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476851">I also think that there is another reason this bill is a step in the wrong direction.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1476852">It is another topic that we broached at committee time and again and I hope we explore even further. I see my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128543" Type="2">Simcoe North</Affiliation> nodding again. It is the concept of honour of the Crown. I readily admit that I am not yet grounded enough in the concept to fully comprehend all of its ramifications, but I know that it is rather far-reaching.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476853">The honour of the Crown concept is one that has been invoked by the Supreme Court in matters dealing with aboriginal communities to strike down legislation. The last time I heard it was used was by the aboriginal communities in British Columbia to basically tell the government that it cannot sell properties, as it was planning to. The department had this plan to sell nine properties, two of which were in B.C. and two of which were subject to land claims by aboriginal communities. Because the government had not consulted these communities, the Supreme Court essentially said that the honour of the Crown concept applied and it could not sell those two buildings. They were withdrawn from the package of assets of buildings that the Crown was selling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476854">The honour of the Crown concept is a concept that applies to all things aboriginal and beyond that. In this case, I would think that if we were to proceed with this bill in the manner we are proposing, which is to force it through the House at second reading so that the committee is restricted in its ability to give it shape, listen to the witnesses and give voice to their concerns in a constructive way, the bill would be subject to court challenges quite readily if it were to become law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476855">As legislators, we have a duty to try to prevent that. We have a duty to construct good law according to principles that were established in our Constitution. If we were to proceed this way, when we have heard that the consultation might not have been as thorough or as listened to as the aboriginal communities would have hoped, perhaps we would then be creating faulty legislation that would be subject to fairly serious challenges on this notion of honour of the Crown. This must permeate what we do as agents of the Crown. We are Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition. The government is her agent. Together, we have responsibilities toward the Crown.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476856">I am not sure that proceeding this way is the best way to fulfill these obligations or fiduciary responsibilities. We can call them what we will. As we continue the work in committee, I would hope that this concept becomes much more well understood by members of the committee and beyond. I think it is a concept that we will see coming much more to the fore as we try to honour the new spirit of working with aboriginal communities throughout this land.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1476857">I will sum up briefly because I only have a few minutes left.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476858">My colleagues must understand that we are not trying to avoid taking action or to reject everything. We are telling the government that there is a more constructive way to approach a very delicate problem. I believe all parties agree that the bill attempts to resolve a very complex and delicate situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476859">To draft a law that will be accepted by everyone, we must all put a little water in our wine and we must be prepared to hear from those most affected. Those people have been telling us for weeks that they cannot support this bill and they have asked the government to not proceed with it. That places us in a difficult situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476860">I will come back to my basic premise: had the government truly wanted to give parliamentarians the latitude to work together and create a bill to reflect the collective will of all political parties and all aboriginal communities, it could have referred this bill to committee before second reading. It chose not to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476861">Earlier, I asked the parliamentary secretary why the government did not do so and chose instead to force a vote at second reading.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476862">The government is therefore asking for approval in principle. It has chosen to limit the committee's power, after having listened to witnesses, to propose constructive amendments and—together—the government and the members of the three opposition parties—to develop a bill that we could all have been proud of. It could have taken another approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476863">The members of the official opposition take their duty seriously. By proposing this motion, we are telling the government that it is not taking the right approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476864">I will make a last appeal to the good will of my Bloc and NDP colleagues. What we are proposing today could be avoided altogether if we all told the government to refer the bill to committee before second reading. We must give the committee, which has already demonstrated its competence, the tools to do the work that is needed. We have a great deal of listening to do. We must listen to all those who wish to participate. We must take their grievances into account. When we find contradictions and disagreements, we must look for common ground.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476865">As responsible parliamentarians, we must find a way to produce a bill that really reflects the government's responsibilities and our responsibilities as parliamentarians, our responsibilities under the Canadian Constitution and our responsibilities that arise from Supreme Court of Canada rulings. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476866">This all could have been moved ahead by referring the bill to committee before second reading. I do not know why the government, a minority government, stubbornly refuses to refer any bills to committee. Many committees, such as the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, which I mentioned earlier, have a proven record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476867">The chair of that committee, a government member, is nodding his head in agreement with my assertion that the members of that committee have proven that they work well together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476868">Both bills we studied were fully supported by aboriginal communities. However, aboriginal communities are not in favour of the bill we are being asked to support here today, and that is a serious problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476869">I implore the government to reconsider its approach and do its homework over again in order to come up with a solution that will be better for everyone.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1476871"> moved that Bill <Document DbId="3628552" Type="4">C-309, An Act establishing the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Region of Northern Ontario</Document>, be read the second time and referred to a committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476872"> He said: Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="3628552" Type="4">C-309</Document>. This proposed legislation looks to take the current federal economic development initiative for northern Ontario, otherwise known as FedNor, and convert it into an agency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476873">Before I go into the details why I believe FedNor ought to become a full-fledged government agency, I would like to discuss two main facts about the Canadian economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476874">The economy of Canada is not one homogeneous entity. Different regions face different challenges. They have different growth rates, different strengths, and different weaknesses. Each region is unique and deserves special attention so that it can flourish and allow its residents to provide for their families and to live a decent and prosperous life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476875">Contrary to what the Conservative government believes, the federal government does not have an important role to play in promoting and encouraging the full potential of Canada's regions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476876">Having said this, there are a number of steps that can be taken by all levels of government to promote regional economic development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476877">First, there must be a fundamental recognition and understanding of the fact that different regions require different policies to develop their full economic potential. One size does not fit all when it comes to economic development. It is only by understanding that regions have different economic potential, that the essential building blocks can be put in place to ensure that full advantage can be taken of all available resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476878">Second, the structure or, perhaps more important, the people who operate the structure have to understand the impact that they have on the economy, so that adjustments can be made on an ongoing basis to ensure that the economic realities of that region are being properly addressed. These changes are most effective when they are proposed by local people who are most directly affected by the impact of their recommendations.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1476879">So, having the structure in place is important. What is crucial, however, is that the people in charge understand what is happening in the regional economy. That being said, I would like to talk about the programs we have in place at this time.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1476880">Prior to the announcement made in budget 2009, the government had four regional economic development organizations. There were three agencies, which were the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, better known as ACOA, Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions, better known as DEQ, and Western Economic Diversification Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476881">Then after the 2009 budget SODA was added, Southern Ontario Development Agency, as well as the new regional economic development agency for the north. Now we have five different entities. One is a program and the rest are agencies. Why is northern Ontario different than all the rest? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476882">Let us look at the difference between a program and an agency. The minister will tell us that words “program” and “agency” have no effect under Canadian law. He is right. Under Canadian law, there is no difference, but as far as Parliament goes, there is a difference. What separates FedNor from its counterparts is that each of the counterparts has an act of Parliament establishing it as a separate entity and outlining its mandate and powers, while FedNor does not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476883">The status of an agency in legislation means that the federal government requires the consent of Parliament to change or alter the agency's powers or its mandate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476884">In essence, a program can be changed, manipulated or even eliminated on a whim. We know the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has often spoken of eliminating regional economic development programs and agencies. He does not believe in them. This is something that really worries me, losing everything we have because the Prime Minister decides he does not believe in them any more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476885">This bill would protect us from all governments, future and present. We know the present one does not believe in it, but future governments have to be protected as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476886">The regions have their differences and those differences have to be respected. The Conservatives will claim that the free market system will take care of everything. We know that is not the case. We have just gone through the last six months, which have been outrageous, and it really has not worked for us. If we go with a free market system as the Conservatives would like, we would end up with some major centres in Canada, perhaps five large urban centres where the mass of the population would live and the regions would have nothing. There would be a vast waste land in between them. Everything would gravitate to where it is cheapest for large providers to provide services. That is not my Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476887">One of the other arguments that comes up is financial reporting. Currently FedNor's performance and financial reports are included as a chapter of Industry Canada's reports on plans and priorities and departmental performance reports. It is not a big chapter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476888">As a separate agency, under the Financial Administration Act, FedNor would be required to file detailed financial and performance reports for tabling in Parliament. The reports on plans and priorities would outline the agency's objectives, programs, spending plans and departmental performance reports, which evaluate whether the objectives have been met and provide the details of previous spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476889">Let me elaborate on what that means in simpler terms. As an agency FedNor, would file estimates. Estimates give full details of what is planned for the coming year. From this, one can take a much closer look at the list of proposed funding and activities that are being planned and managed for the upcoming year, so they have a good vision of where the economic development is going in a certain region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476890">As a program on the other hand, the details become lost as part of the budget of Industry Canada. This means that as it stands now FedNor, as a program, really has no details. There is no breakdown of activities. There is nothing but a few numbers which imply that the program can be played with by the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> at his will or the minister himself. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476891">Unlike an agency, reports for a program can only be seen at year end. To add insult to injury, it takes another six to eight months before those numbers come out, if we are lucky. After year end, we have to look at the detailed compilation of expenses, activities and reviews, but that is as much as 18 months after the beginning of the process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476892"> It is like driving a car and concentrating on the rear view mirror. We cannot really look to the future. We are seeing what is behind us all the time. With regional economic development, we really have to look ahead and see where we will go, where we want to be and what kind of programs we want to have in place.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1476893">A prime example of what I am talking is this. Recently at the industry, science and technology committee, I asked the minister for detailed estimates for FedNor for the upcoming year. When I asked for those details, he said that he could give me something called “Northern Spirit”, which is a brochure. It is very colourful, it has beautiful pictures and it has all kinds of neat stories in it. I am sure some of the members on the other side were disappointed because the pictures were already coloured in. It was a really pretty brochure with no numbers, not one. It was basically a pamphlet that was handed out. We looked at it and put it aside.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476894">What we are looking for is estimates, something that breaks down exactly what we can expect over the next year, and then plan for it.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1476895">Another problem is that the program does not have a minister to look after that and that alone. Under the Liberals, we had a minister of state for FedNor. Since the Conservative government has been in power, there has been no minister for FedNor. That portfolio now comes under Industry Canada, and that worries me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476896">Just this morning, I was speaking with a municipal councillor from northern Ontario. He said FedNor has received a number of applications, but they are still sitting on the minister's desk. They are sitting there and have not been approved. From what I have heard, nearly $8 million could be put into the economy. That money is not in the economy; it is sitting on the minister's desk. I understand that industry is a large portfolio and I am sure the minster must be very busy. However, we cannot forget the smaller regions. I know he is kept busy by the auto industry and many others, but northern industries like forestry are vital to northern Ontario. It is very important that these investments be approved so they can return to northern Ontario's economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476897">Something I often think about is the fact that the people of northern Ontario are not second class citizens. We are Canadians like everyone else, like all voters. So, if a program exists, it should be given the same level of respect as an agency. That is the goal of my bill.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1476898">The Conservatives said previously that they did not intend to support Bill <Document DbId="3628552" Type="4">C-309</Document> because it would lead to an increase in costs in bureaucracy. That is nonsense. Corporate services is one of the big areas at which they look. They say that every agency will need corporate services and that Industry Canada takes care of it for FedNor. That is not true. FedNor already has its own corporate services and communications division. If it were turned into a separate agency, creating these divisions would not be an issue. Some Conservatives will also argue against the conversion for FedNor. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476899">We know, overall, Conservatives are not known for nation-building. They do not instinctively bring people together. They are use to wedging, getting groups apart and conquering, which is one way of doing things. I am not here to judge anybody and telling them whether it is right or wrong, but that is not the way the Liberals do it. The Conservatives do not look at the big picture. Everybody does their own thing. That is not the way to build a nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476900">If the Conservatives had it their way, and we have heard the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> say it before, they would leave the economy to its own devices. In light of what we have seen over the last six months, that is not always possible and I do not think it works in the long-term. That may work in short spurts in the short-term and then we get booms, but the busts are what hurts. Government does play a role in what is done in the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476901">If we left the economy to its own devices, we would see a migration of people from regions to major centres. They would migrate to a few metropolitan areas and that would be it for Canada. Canada would be very sparsely populated in between because the concentration would be in the large cities, and we can understand that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476902">That is not my Canada. I do not believe most Canadians want that. They want to know they have the possibility of earning a living anywhere in Canada. This is not about being in just an urban centre. It is about being everywhere in Canada. My Canada includes northern regions and rural regions. My Canada includes all of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476903">Since the Conservatives took office in 2006, the FedNor budget has been slashed by nearly $6 million. Bill <Document DbId="3628552" Type="4">C-309</Document> is designed to ensure that FedNor would not be subjected to further cuts or elimination altogether.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476904">Bill <Document DbId="3628552" Type="4">C-309</Document> is designed to promote economic development, economic diversification and job creation in communities throughout northern Ontario. A FedNor agency would demand greater accountability and would be required to report to Parliament on a regular basis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476905">My Liberal colleagues and I are committed to ensuring that the residents of northern Ontario are given every opportunity to develop and maintain a strong regional economy, as well as diversify strength in their employment base. Residents of northern Ontario expect and deserve the same opportunities, the same access and accountability and the same quality of service as their fellow Canadians in all other parts of the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476906">Bill <Document DbId="3628552" Type="4">C-309</Document> has received widespread support from municipalities throughout northern Ontario, including the Federation of Northern Ontario Municipalities. I trust my hon. colleagues from the three parties in the House will also support the bill based on its merits.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1476908">Mr. Speaker, that is a rumour that has been around for quite some time. There has been a rumour about money being funnelled into southern Ontario from FedNor. It is not quite true. This has been going on for a number of years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476909">There is the community futures program that allows for economic development on a smaller scale and allows small operators to get money. It is a loan program. That money is administered by FedNor out of Sudbury for all of Ontario. That is very important because it is not FedNor money but it is being administered from Sudbury in northern Ontario. Those are federal jobs being put into Sudbury and not centralized in Ottawa. They could have been anywhere in the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476910">That is a case for regional economic development in northern Ontario. Business can be conducted from anywhere in the world with today's electronics and programs. With everything that is out there, one can have pretty well anything one wants in northern Ontario. This is a prime example of how federal services put in place by the Liberal Party are creating jobs in Sudbury for the rest of Ontario.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1476911">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to stand in the House today to discuss northern Ontario and specifically the role of FedNor, the regional economic development organization for northern Ontario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476912">As the <Affiliation DbId="128698" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> told the members of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, our strategy is ”if it ain't broke, don't fix it”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476913">Our government continues to build a healthy future for northern Ontario and for most economic growth through the delivery of FedNor's northern Ontario development program and the community futures program. It is no secret that FedNor receives broad-based and universal support from mayors, community leaders and other stakeholders in northern Ontario. The reason is simple: it works.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476914">I will now talk about the fine work that FedNor does in northern Ontario through the northern Ontario development program, or NODP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476915">By hearing more about FedNor's role in northern Ontario, I hope all members will garner a better understanding of how much this organization impacts on the lives of northerners. FedNor does much more than simply fund individual projects in the many communities it serves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476916">When community partners, leaders and stakeholders identify opportunities for development in northern Ontario, they come to FedNor with these ideas and their proposals. FedNor staff is closely connected to the communities they serve and they know the challenges and needs of those communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476917">FedNor works with project proponents to ensure how best to meet their needs. It considers the benefits of specific projects on a local, regional and pan-northern scale, working with partners to maximize the impact of FedNor projects. In short, FedNor takes a truly holistic approach to economic development, funding projects that will collectively strengthen the whole of northern Ontario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476918">To accomplish this, FedNor focuses on specific sectors or areas of northern Ontario's economy, keeping in mind that each project builds the capacity that is needed to undertake other worthwhile initiatives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476919">At the same time, FedNor delivers the Government of Canada's agenda in northern Ontario, such as our economic action plan. New initiatives, such as the community adjustment fund, will help us keep the economy of northern Ontario moving.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476920">Canada's economic action plan will have a direct and positive impact on the economy of northern Ontario and FedNor will continue to work closely with northern Ontario communities and industry leaders to ensure that our efforts meet their specific needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476921">FedNor supports northern Ontario projects that complement our government's strategy to promote a competitive, knowledge-based nation. In 2007-08, the northern Ontario development program's annual grants and contributions' budget totalled more than $36 million. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476922">I will now illustrate how FedNor is using this budget successfully to grow the northern Ontario economy. First, I will give some background. The northern Ontario development program covers a large geographic area. Northern Ontario represents about 90% of the province's land mass. It stretches from Muskoka to James Bay and from the border of my province of Manitoba to the border of Quebec. This great part of Canada is also home to more than 850,000 people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476923">The vastness of northern Ontario, given its relatively low population, helps explain some of the challenges, including: geographic isolation from large, urban markets to the south; limited telecommunications and transportation infrastructure; static or declining population; high youth out-migration rates; and a lower than average employment growth. FedNor's northern Ontario development program is working to address these issues and much more. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476924">Specifically, the northern Ontario development program promotes economic growth in northern Ontario through the delivery of contributions funding. Funding is directed primarily to not for profit organizations for projects not eligible for commercial financing and projects that are key to the development of capacity in the north. Program contributions are available to support projects in six areas: community economic development, innovation, information and communications technology, human capital, business financing support, and trade and tourism. FedNor is making a real difference in each of these areas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476925">In the area of community economic development, FedNor focuses its efforts on strategic planning to enhance business competitiveness and job creation. To help communities deal with the challenges of sudden or severe downturns affecting the local economy, FedNor supports diversification strategies. Never have these types of strategies been more important than they are today during these difficult economic times.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="50">(1750)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1476926">One excellent example is the northern Ontario value-added initiative, or NOVA. This three year initiative is introducing communities affected by the downturn in the forestry sector to new forestry related economic renewal opportunities. NOVA representatives have undertaken a tour of about 200 mills and secondary forestry related operations to introduce this program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476927">In essence, the project is supporting the development of value-added products and improvements to manufacturing processes as well as providing market access information. In addition to its diversification initiatives, FedNor also promotes regional initiatives that build strong, sustainable communities. One such initiative is the Northern Centre for Advanced Technology, or NORCAT. The Northern Centre for Advanced Technology is one of a cluster of premiere research and development organizations in northern Ontario that our government has supported through FedNor.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476928">With FedNor's help, NORCAT has grown to become a leader in the development and commercialization of new mining technologies. In fact, in April 2008, this government invested $2 million of FedNor funding into NORCAT to construct a state of the art building to house a new incubator facility and centralize NORCAT'S technology development and industrial services. This NORCAT centre will provide the private sector with one-stop access to NORCAT's industrial training and innovation services. It will also bring to the region a new service for small businesses and pre-commercial entrepreneurs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476929">Once complete, the centre will accommodate up to 22 small and medium size enterprises by providing flexible rental space, access to labs and workshops, as well as business and technology support services. The positive impact of this investment in NORCAT will be felt in northern Ontario for decades to come. It is but one example of the great work FedNor has been able to accomplish under a Conservative government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476930">Projects like this are building the capacity that northern Ontario needs to diversify its economy. That is community economic development. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476931">To keep moving forward, we must ensure that we have the human capital to support our efforts to build a strong northern Ontario. In that light, FedNor supports other important initiatives that provide northerners with the opportunity to remain in and contribute to their respective communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476932">One concrete example is FedNor's successful youth internship program. In the summer of 2006, FedNor celebrated the placement of the program's 1,000th youth intern. Since 2002, FedNor has invested over $35.7 million in youth related projects across northern Ontario. Designed to help post-secondary graduates make the transition from the campus to the workplace, this program provides interns with hands-on experience and an opportunity to find full-time employment in the north. It also helps to stem the tide of youth leaving northern Ontario, which has long been a serious issue in northern Ontario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476933">We know that only 25% of young people who leave northern Ontario for education or employment opportunities ever return. FedNor is serious about providing opportunities for its best and brightest to ensure they remain and contribute to the future of northern Ontario. As an added benefit, the internship program also provides employment assistance for small businesses and not for profit organizations that are looking to grow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476934">It is important for the communities and businesses of northern Ontario that FedNor remains flexible and responsive as an organization to benefit the people it serves. As members will hear from my colleagues, FedNor's other areas of focus are also bearing fruit across all of northern Ontario.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="128616" Type="2">Mr. Jean-Yves Roy (Haute-Gaspésie—La Mitis—Matane—Matapédia, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1476935">Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by saying that the Bloc Québécois will support Bill <Document DbId="3628552" Type="4">C-309, An Act establishing the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Region of Northern Ontario</Document>, which was introduced by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128394" Type="2">Nipissing—Timiskaming</Affiliation>. It is not that we support federal government interference in regional development, but if the people of northern Ontario and the Government of Ontario want to create an agency, the Bloc Québécois would obviously be ill advised to oppose it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476936">The purpose of Bill <Document DbId="3628552" Type="4">C-309</Document> is to establish the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Region of Northern Ontario, which, like the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec, would be responsible for promoting the development of northern Ontario in accordance with an integrated federal strategy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476937">The Bloc Québécois defends Quebec's interests, and that is why in the past we voted against Bill <Document DbId="1395862" Type="3">C-9</Document>, which created the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec. Members will say that we are being inconsistent. We voted against creating an agency in Quebec, yet we support creating an agency in Ontario. I have no problem with that, because if the people in northern Ontario want to create such an agency, then naturally we will support them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476938">The Bloc Québécois believes, as all the governments of Quebec have believed for more than 45 years, that in order to be able to develop an integrated policy on regional development, Quebec must have control over regional development programs. I will explain this further during my speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476939">As my colleague has just said, the regions are the ones with the solutions. Quebec in particular has organizations that focus on the socio-economic development of their regions. These organizations are in a position to properly advise the minister on regional needs and to help with program implementation. The local development centres were created specifically to develop the regional economy and to advise ministers in order to ensure that the investments made would be as cost effective as possible for regional development. Over the years, we have also created another kind of organization, the regional conferences of elected officials, which bring together all mayors and other elected officials in each of the regions. Obviously, they examine every file relating to regional development and they, too, are well placed to provide the minister responsible with proper advice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476940">The Bloc Québécois is aware that not all governments have the same priorities. Despite the fact that the agency is joyfully trampling on Quebec's toes in its jurisdiction, if the Government of Ontario has decided to welcome this structure into its regional economy, we cannot do otherwise than agree, as I said. It must be pointed out as well that Ontario has been hit very hard by the economic crisis, northern Ontario even more so because of the forestry crisis and the decline of the auto industry. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476941">I would like to make the point that a true regional development strategy needs to include a broad range of components: natural resources, education, training, municipal affairs, land use, infrastructure and so on, none of which are in any way federal responsibilities. In fact, the Canadian Constitution entrusts most things that concern regional development to Quebec and the provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476942">In order to be in a position to create an integrated regional development policy, all of the governments of Quebec in the past 45-plus years have been demanding control of the regional development program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476943">Between 1973 and 1994, an agreement was in place between the Government of Quebec and the government in Ottawa. According to it, Ottawa could not invest in regional development without the agreement of the Government of Quebec. In 1994, that agreement was broken. Since that time, there have been two parallel structures in Quebec, those of the Government of Quebec and those of the federal government, which both invest in regional development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476944">Very often the two are in conflict with each other, because the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec sets priorities for itself that are not shared by Quebec or the regions of Quebec. This clash of regional development systems is a very common occurrence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476945">Another phenomenon has also cropped up since the Conservatives have been in power. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="00">(1800)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1476946">As my colleague mentioned, the government made deep cuts to the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec's budget. Those cuts were significant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476947">Since 1994, the agency has been investing in research and development organizations responsible for supporting businesses. I could list all kinds of organizations in every region of Quebec that were responsible for helping small and medium-sized businesses conduct research and development and bring their ideas to market. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476948">Small and medium-sized businesses do not necessarily have the financial means to do research and create and launch new products. That is why the agency invested in those kinds of organizations. Then, suddenly, two years ago in 2007, the agency withdrew its support. That is the problem with having two parallel regional development systems. The Canadian agency withdrew, and now a lot of those organizations are in trouble. Basically, the entire structure that the Government of Quebec and the regions of Quebec built over the years has been demolished.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476949">I can provide actual examples of that in my region. Among other things, the forest research centre, which was supported by the Canadian agency, was unexpectedly told that it would have to begin turning a profit within about two years. That was utterly impossible. That kind of development will no longer be happening. The federal government must understand that regional development cannot happen without taking into account each region's priorities and those of the Government of Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476950">Earlier, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128557" Type="2">Abitibi—Témiscamingue</Affiliation> was talking about the Minister of Industry. I should point out that the Minister of Industry was responsible for the agency, and he is the one who cut funding to several organizations in Quebec. The new minister tried to restore funding, but I do not think that he tried hard enough, because instead of restoring the funding, organizations were simply given an extra year within which to become profitable. It is no secret that most research and development organizations will never be profitable because they do research and development to bring products to market. It takes years and years to turn a profit, and that is not what these organizations are meant to do. Their role is to support businesses, not replace them. That is where the government made its mistake.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476951">Earlier, my colleague said that the <Affiliation DbId="128698" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> was very busy because there are files piled up on his desk. I would say to him that is probably the same tactic he used at the Economic Development Agency of Canada because everything ended up on his desk. Files would languish and he was accused—I believe rightly—of engaging in petty politics, cheap politics, by using the funds of the Economic Development Agency of Canada. In my opinion, the same thing is currently happening at Industry Canada. It is the same minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476952">Let us be serious. He probably used the same tactics and is probably continuing to use the same approach. That means files were not dealt with, files are languishing and will continue to do so because he has to look at all of them, one by one, and he does not trust anyone, especially not the directors of agencies in Quebec and probably not Industry department officials.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476953">I am being told that I have one minute left. Therefore I will repeat that the Bloc Québécois will support the creation of a development agency for northern Ontario because that is the decision of the people who live there and of the Ontario government, and that is important to us. Therefore, if those people want it, as a political party that respects all regions, I believe that we must vote for Bill <Document DbId="3628552" Type="4">C-309</Document>.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1476959">When I was elected several months ago, I felt very privileged to be assigned the FedNor file within the NDP caucus. Throughout northern Ontario, people have been experiencing an epidemic rate of job losses over the past few years, and even more so within the past few months. Both of our main sectors, forestry and mining, have been hit hard during this recession. We have seen job losses at Xstrata, Vale Inco, AbitibiBowater, John Deere, CBC, Persona, and the list goes on and on. It is crucial for northern Ontario that we have a fully independent and appropriately resourced economic development agency.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1476960">FedNor must be able to adapt to the changing economy and ensure the economic prosperity of the workers of northern Ontario and their families.

              <ParaText id="1476962">We need a FedNor that can adapt to our changing economy and ensure economic prosperity for northern Ontario workers and their families. FedNor's mandate needs to be developed locally by the people of northern Ontario, not by some bureaucrat buried within Industry Canada stationed in Ottawa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476963">It is time to stop treating northern Ontarians like second-class citizens. There are economic development agencies throughout the country that have the capacity to make a real difference in the local economy. There is no excuse not to create one for northern Ontario, where we face so many economic challenges. During this recession, our economy needs to diversify and grow. Now is the time to encourage small business start-ups and expansions, and community economic development. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476964">Because FedNor is underfunded, many worthy projects are turned down. The Centre for Excellence in Mining Innovation would make northern Ontario a world leader in mining resources and development. CEMI is currently researching exploration, deep mining, integrated mine process engineering, and environmental sustainability, all areas that would greatly enhance the competitiveness of the mining sector not only in northern Ontario but throughout the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476965">CEMI has received funding from the Government of Ontario, Vale Inco, Xstrata, Laurentian University, the Greater City of Sudbury, and the Ontario Mineral Industry Cluster. The private sector, provincial and municipal governments have all come to the table to support the centre. Yet, FedNor has declined CEMI's application because it does not have enough funding to meet the request. This is a slap in the face for northern Ontario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476966">With our mining sector suffering as it is, now is the time for the federal government to pull its weight and invest in research and innovation, so that we can be ready when the economy rebounds.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1476967">The long-term care facility at Chelmsford, St. Joseph's Health Centre, is another FedNor reject. This facility will make 128 beds available and employ 160 full- and part-time workers. Once again, the provincial and municipal governments and the community were on board with this project, but FedNor rejected its application because it did not fit into the narrow FedNor mandate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476968">There is a bed shortage for patients requiring a higher level of care in Sudbury and Nickel Belt, and this institution will be a great help in alleviating that problem. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476969">As well, the area needs good permanent jobs. Nevertheless the FedNor mandate is not flexible enough to meet some of our communities' most crying needs.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1476970">A second project that was also turned down by FedNor is the St. Joseph's long-term care facility in Chelmsford. This facility will create 128 long-term care beds and employ 160 full-time and part-time workers. Again, the provincial and municipal governments, as well as the community, have come to the table to support this facility. St. Joseph's application was turned down by FedNor because it does not meet the narrow mandate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476971">There is an alternative care bed shortage in Sudbury and Nickel Belt. This facility would go a long way in alleviating this crisis. There is also a need for good jobs and permanent employment. Despite this, FedNor's mandate is not flexible enough to meet some of our community's most pressing needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476972">Meanwhile, projects throughout southern Ontario are receiving funding through programs administered by FedNor, while the people of northern Ontario are being left behind. Northern Ontario is a socially, geologically, ecologically and economically distinct region situated on the boreal forest of the Canadian Shield. It is home to 102 of the 134 first nations in Ontario, 43% of Ontario's aboriginal population and 27% of Ontario's francophone population. It is a treasure house of natural resources, lands and waters, provincial parks, fisheries and natural wilderness areas.

              <ParaText id="1476973">Northern Ontario clearly faces unique challenges, but also great opportunities. Our region deserves its own regional economic development agency. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476974">I am urging all members of this House to support this bill through its second reading. The people of northern Ontario have been ignored by the government for far too long. With the passage of this legislation, FedNor would be able to take its rightful place as an independent, fully funded economic development agency. I think it is broke, so let us fix it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1476975">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to speak to Bill <Document DbId="3628552" Type="4">C-309</Document>, in the name of my distinguished colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128394" Type="2">Nipissing—Timiskaming</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476976">My colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128394" Type="2">Nipissing—Timiskaming</Affiliation>, is the chair of our national caucus. He is a very powerful and consistent voice for regional development in northern Ontario. He is somebody who speaks often in our caucus and in numerous meetings I have attended about the importance of investing in the regions of the country, about the importance of understanding that the regional economy of the area he represents in northern Ontario is different from some of the challenges or some of the economies, for example, in southern Ontario, which is also suffering in this very difficult Conservative recession.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476977">Our colleague, when he introduced the bill, made a very compelling case why FedNor should in fact have its separate legal status and a statute creating an agency of the Government of Canada and not simply a program buried at the Department of Industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476978">I come from Atlantic Canada. The Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, ACOA, as my colleague from northern Ontario noted, has a separate statute. It is created by an act of Parliament with a mandate. It is set up under federal law to operate as an agency of the Government of Canada. It is not subject to an administrative committee or a bureaucratic decision at some third level buried at the Department of Industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476979">I do not know why economic development in northern Ontario would take a second-class position to the importance of investing in regional development in Atlantic Canada, in western Canada, with the economic diversification initiative, or in the Quebec regions with Développement economique Canada pour les régions du Québec.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1476980">As my colleague pointed out earlier, the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec operates at arm's length from the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476981">I think it would be a good idea to have a minister in Parliament who can appear before parliamentary committees, a minister responsible for credits and for protecting the interests of northern Ontario.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1476982">We are left to ask ourselves why the Conservative government is going to oppose the bill. Why are the Conservatives going to resist putting regional development in northern Ontario on the same footing as it is in other regions of the country? Why did they create an agency for economic development in southern Ontario? As I said a minute ago, that region is suffering serious economic distress as a result of the global economic recession and the inability of the Conservative government to face head on the economic challenges facing every region of the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476983">Is there an agenda in the Conservative government to abandon northern Ontario? Are the Conservatives leaving it as a program at the Department of Industry instead of a separate agency of the government created by statute? Did someone at some meeting on a Monday morning or a Friday afternoon at the Department of Industry on Queen Street here in Ottawa decide that another program in the department was short of money so they would get a bit from FedNor?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476984">It is horribly unfair to leave the economic future of the communities represented by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128394" Type="2">Nipissing—Timiskaming</Affiliation> and other members of the House from northern Ontario so vulnerable in the face of competing budget priorities and in the face of what I believe is a complete disinterest on the part of the Conservative government in regional development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476985">As I said a moment ago, I represent a riding in rural New Brunswick where regional development is essential not only for the economic future of the community, but also for municipalities to have access to an infrastructure program that meets the unique needs of smaller municipalities and some remote and regional communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476986">One of the more compelling arguments for economic development that I have ever heard, and for the idea that the Government of Canada has to be involved in regional development, came from the late Harrison McCain. Mr. McCain was a great New Brunswick entrepreneur who began the McCain Foods global enterprise which operates in dozens of countries around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476987">McCain Foods began as an idea to process potatoes in a village called Florenceville, New Brunswick. In the 1970s, when the two McCain brothers, the late Harrison McCain and Wallace McCain, decided to open McCain Foods, they could not find a commercial lending institution that would give two entrepreneurs from rural New Brunswick the millions of dollars they needed to set up their first french fry production facility. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476988">The department of regional industrial expansion existed at that time in the Trudeau government. That was the federal economic development agency which decided to partner with McCain Foods in rural New Brunswick. I have heard Harrison McCain tell the story himself about the interest of the Government of Canada in helping people in the small village of Florenceville. Florenceville probably has a population of less than a few thousand. It is an hour and a half drive from the city of Fredericton, along the Saint John River Valley in New Brunswick, known as the potato belt because it is a very fertile area for growing potatoes. If the Government of Canada had not stood by the McCain brothers in the 1970s, we would not have a globally competitive business called McCain Foods operating in almost every continent called.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476989">When we think of what the importance of a small investment meant at that time to the future economic prosperity of a company as important, I would argue, to Canada and to our export picture as a food-producing country as McCain Foods, then we have not understood the importance of the federal role in regional development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476990">That brings me back to my colleague's bill, Bill <Document DbId="3628552" Type="4">C-309</Document>, which seeks simply to give FedNor the same status as the other economic development agencies. It does not seek, as some Conservative members would assert, to increase the budget or duplicate administrative costs, or set up a corporate service branch that does not exist now. As my colleague accurately described, these services currently exist within the program operated as FedNor. What does not exist is the legal status of an agency with a mandate from this Parliament to operate in the interests of the economic development of a region as important to our country as is northern Ontario. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="20">(1820)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1476991">Consider the difficulties in the forestry sector, for example. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128394" Type="2">Nipissing—Timiskaming</Affiliation> has spoken many times about the challenge the American subsidies around black liquor represent for the Canadian pulp and paper industry. It is a very critical time for this industry. Thousands of jobs have already been lost. Tens of thousands of jobs are threatened. The government needs to get engaged in the fight to support these industries, workers and communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476992">If we do not have a separate agency like FedNor, which can understand the economic challenges of the forestry or mining sectors in the economy of northern Ontario, and we simply rely on the Department of Industry on Queen Street in Ottawa to be interested in the difficulties of operating a sawmill in a small remote community of northern Ontario where there is the challenge of building logging roads across a vast expanse of territory, then we have not understood the importance of building a truly national economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476993">If the Conservative government were sincere about wanting every region of the country to prosper, it would stand up for FedNor. It would not bury it in some office at the Department of Industry in Ottawa. It would give it a legal status similar to ACOA, which is an agency that is so important to my region in Atlantic Canada, or to DEC, Développement économique Canada pour les régions du Québec. It would support Bill <Document DbId="3628552" Type="4">C-309</Document>, which I think is a great testimony to the commitment of my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128394" Type="2">Nipissing—Timiskaming</Affiliation> to northern Ontario.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1476994">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to and discuss the implications of private member's Bill <Document DbId="3628552" Type="4">C-309</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476995"> The bill proposes, at a significant cost to the taxpayer, to create a new federal agency with its own deputy minister and with its own bureaucracy to administer economic development programs exclusively to northern Ontario. Bill C-309, in essence, aims to create an agency to do what FedNor, a program administered by Industry Canada, is already doing and doing quite well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476996">Communities and rural areas in northern Ontario continue to face challenges that affect the stability and the development of their economy, both in the short and in the long term. Some of these challenges include: geographic isolation from large urban markets to the south; limited telecommunications and transportation infrastructure; static or declining population; a high youth out-migration rate; lower than average employment growth; and limited ability and capacity to respond to the current global economic slowdown.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476997">This great part of our country certainly deserves the support of Canada's government, and I am proud to say that FedNor has been leading the way for years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476998">Since its inception in 1987, FedNor has been operating successfully within Industry Canada. On a daily basis, FedNor staff work with a diverse client base in an effort to build a stronger and more prosperous northern Ontario. These clients include business leaders and professional groups in the areas of tourism, transportation, telecommunications, resource industries, small business, health research and education.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1476999">It appears that the intention of my hon. colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128394" Type="2">Nipissing—Timiskaming</Affiliation> in tabling this bill is to ensure that the government will provide the support that northern Ontario needs to continue to thrive. Today, FedNor is providing this support and it is doing so quite successfully, I might add. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477000">To understand the implications of the bill, we need to turn the clock back just a bit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477001"> In 1987 the federal economic development initiative for northern Ontario, FedNor, was created to serve the economic development needs of the northern part of this province. It was established as a program within Industry Canada, within its regional operations sector, where it still remains today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477002">It was in 1995, some eight years later, when Industry Canada, through FedNor, became responsible for administering the community futures program across rural Ontario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477003">In other regions, the community futures program is administered by the three existing regional development agencies in Canada: the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, the Western Economic Diversification and the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477004">What makes the community futures program unique is that each community futures organization counts on the expertise of volunteer boards made up of local residents who bring a variety of expertise to the table.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477005">The community futures program builds on the philosophy that local residents are best positioned to make decisions about the future of their communities. The program has become a driving force for business and for community development across the province of Ontario. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477006">We move some seven years later to 2004 when FedNor took on the responsibility of administering the new eastern Ontario development program. The success of this program can, in part, be attributed to the excellent administration and flexible management structure from which FedNor currently benefits by being part of Industry Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477007">In addition to the responsibilities I have mentioned, FedNor also administers funding for the economic development of official language minority communities in Ontario. This has involved coordinating consultations with our official language minority communities to identify gaps and to identify needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477008">FedNor has taken a lead role in promoting the vitality of these communities by working with its community futures partners to bring about service improvements. These efforts are helping to ensure that the community futures development corporations have the support they need to meet the official language needs of their communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477009">In the past, FedNor has administered other initiatives in Ontario,on behalf of the Government of Canada, such as the softwood industry community economic adjustment initiative.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1477012">Mr. Speaker, I asked a question in the House and the answer really did not address the question at all. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477013">One of the key comments I made was that the <Affiliation DbId="128704" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> was strong on spin, but weak on crime. Now what I need to add is he and his government are tough on police. That is an unfortunate reality of the decisions and the policies of the Conservative government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477014">Is it not enough that the government has broken its promise to put 2,500 more police on the street? I had a visit from representatives of the police and RCMP. They advised me that the funding, which would not have covered 2,500 police in either case, was not tied to any additional police being hired. Therefore, the funding the Conservative government claimed was for more police, had no accountability that it would actually deliver more police. I could not get any clarity as to whether one additional police officer or RCMP officer had been hired, based on the promise made by the government. That is simply not good enough. We know how critical police are to apprehending criminals and also to preventing crime, an important objective. This is another broken promise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477015">Second, the approach of the Conservative government to strangle the gun registry is completely not supported by evidence. It is not supported by members of the public. It is not supported by the Association of Chiefs of Police. Police officers use this gun registry 9,000 times a day. More than 5,000 affidavits have been provided by the Canadian Firearms Registry to support the prosecution of firearms related crime and court proceedings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477016">Having a gun registry, according to the police, is a matter of personal safety for their officers. If a policeman is entering a residence in a building and does not have access to an up-to-date accurate registry to find out whether he or she can expect that he or she will face a gun, that police officer's safety is compromised.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477017">Guns used in tragedies, like the rampage through the École Polytechnique de Montréal in which 14 women lost their lives, would have been registered by the long gun registry. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477018">Finally, the government is opposing the rights of police officers, and that is enough to make me shake my head. The government rolled back its promise on the wages for RCMP officers, would have brought them to a level that was at parity with other police officers in Canada. Now the government is opposing collective bargaining rights for their front line officers, whose lives are at risk on a daily basis through their activities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477019">I would appeal to the government. Yes, strong laws for those who are guilty of series crimes is important, and the Liberals support that. However, we need strong prevention measures, including supporting our police forces and RCMP, rather than being tough on police.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477020">Mr. Speaker, I rise to respond to the question put to the House by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128541" Type="2">Vancouver Quadra</Affiliation> regarding the issue of escalating gang violence in British Columbia, at least that is what it was supposed to be, but she certainly rambled around a whole bunch of issues. I will focus my answer on gang violence in British Columbia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477021">The government is committed to giving the streets of our cities back to law-abiding citizens. We believe community safety is a defining value, indeed, a fundamental right in Canadian society. The government is taking concrete action on all fronts and is implementing a balanced approach to reducing crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477022">We are providing the law enforcement community with the tools it needs to combat crime, and we have recently introduced new crime bills to this effect. We are ensuring there is more police presence in our streets, through increased investments in the RCMP in support of hiring of over 1,000 new RCMP police and civilian staff and through our $400 million police officer fund that supports provinces and municipalities to recruit 2,500 additional officers. We are also supporting effective crime prevention measures that will help communities and families keep youth away from lives of drugs and crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477023">We are taking a two-pronged approach, holding accountable before the law those who commit crimes, while helping those who may be at risk before they turn to a life of crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477024"> In this respect, we have renewed the national crime prevention strategy in 2008, effectively doubling the permanent funding for the strategy. This will lead to more stability and predictability in crime prevention efforts across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477025">The hon. member of Parliament would be interested to know that the National Crime Prevention Centre is currently funding more than 20 community-based projects in the province of British Columbia, which are designed to steer vulnerable children and youth away from crime. Two of these projects, worth $2.1 million, are funded through the youth gang prevention program to specifically address the issue of gangs by preventing youths from joining gangs in the first place. These multi-year investments will deliver concrete results to British Columbia communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477026">Effective crime prevention measures cannot be implemented without the active support of local communities, the voluntary sector, parents, and schools. We are therefore working very closely with them to ensure they have access to the most up-to-date information on what works to prevent crime, especially among children and youth who are most vulnerable to negative influence because of their personal lives and circumstances. Furthermore, we are working very closely with provincial governments to ensure the prevention measures that are developed also respond to their priorities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477027"> The effective responses to crime and insecurity require a coordinated approach that brings together all partners and orders of government in a focused effort to combat violence. That is the approach this government is taking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477028">Allow me to underscore the point that our efforts to refocus the national crime prevention strategy were designed to maximize its benefits and effects. This is why the strategy now provides support to communities to implement interventions that are based on the best available evidence and target those most in need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477029">The youth gang prevention fund helps fund community groups that work with troubled youth to prevent them from becoming involved in gang violence by targeting specific risk factors associated with youth gang activity and youth at the highest risk of gang involvement.</ParaText>

She equally had the opportunity to answer it, but she unfortunately decided to sidestep the question. I welcome this second opportunity and I hope the government does as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477036">I want to delve into some of the problems that are faced by people in my riding with respect to employment insurance. In fact, they face two devastating effects of the global economic crisis: its effect on the manufacturing sector in Ontario and on the employment insurance program that systematically discriminates against Ontario residents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477037">Very specifically, I questioned the minister about a constituent of mine in Don Valley West who had lost her learning-while-working internship program because the program was cut due to the economic crisis we are in. This young woman had worked 724 hours before losing her position. However, because of the outdated regulations governing EI, this young woman was not eligible to receive benefits. Consequently, she has no way to feed her family, pay her rent or survive. However, if she had lived in many other parts of the country, she would have had the requisite hours. She would have qualified and would have collected benefits. This is simply wrong. It is simply not fair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477038">The current EI system in Canada leaves 60% of unemployed Canadians out in the cold. Think about that. Six out of every 10 Canadians who find themselves unemployed do not qualify for benefits. Something is wrong with this picture. The minister provided and continues to provide unsatisfactory responses when questioned about EI. On her watch, unemployment has continued to rise. All the while, EI has become more and more difficult to collect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477039">On May 8 it was announced that the unemployment rate is now at 8%, the highest level in seven years. Since October 2008, 321,000 additional Canadians have lost their jobs. Yet, the government is unwilling to revisit the EI program, even though its own constituents must be telling it the same thing. The very nature of unemployment and employment in the economy has changed, so the way that EI works has to change as well. EI needs to be responsive to the situation and it needs to be responsive to people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477040">We need an EI system that changes with the realities of the economy and the needs of Canadians. If the government were to do something now, perhaps it would save us all from being in a worse situation. If it were to address the EI problem right now, we might all avoid the huge unemployment numbers that Canadians found themselves in the last time the Conservatives were in power. The Liberals had to come to the rescue in 1993.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477041">I remind the House that when the Conservatives left office in 1993, they left an unemployment rate of 11.2%. After 13 years of sound Liberal management, we left a 6.6% unemployment rate. That is what they inherited and they squandered it. They have squandered many things, but they have squandered people's lives and jobs. EI is the best economic stimulus we have to keep the economy going. It is money that gets spent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477042">Of course, I am supportive of shovel ready infrastructure projects to stimulate the economy. However, my constituents, as individuals, are also shovel ready. They want to work and there is no work for them. They want to keep food on the table and rent paid. EI is money that goes into the economy, helps people keep jobs, and staves off higher unemployment rates. The government should not be afraid of change. It should not be afraid of fairness or equality. It should not be afraid of intelligence or compassion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477043">The government needs to make the EI system responsive to the economy, which has changed.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1477044">Mr. Speaker, I have to say at the outset that I always find it amusing whenever a Liberal gets up and starts talking about all the problems within the EI system because, as we know and I think most Canadians know, we inherited the current EI system from the Liberal government. As a matter of fact, when the Liberals first set up this program in 1996, unemployment rates were higher than they are now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477045">So, what did we do? We took the basic shell, the basic premise of the program, and we made distinct and significant improvements. Prior to this year's budget, we held widespread consultations across Canada, talking to stakeholders, seeing what they would like to have in an EI program. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477046">What did they tell us? First, they said, without question, they would like to see extended benefits at the tail end of the benefit period. We did that. We extended the benefit period by five weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477047">Second, they said they would like to see more money put into skills upgrading and job training for those people who are unfortunate enough to lose their jobs. We did that. We spent billions of dollars, not only for those people who qualify for EI but we spent over $500 million for skills upgrading programs for those people who did not qualify for EI to begin with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477048">Last, we extended the work share program by 14 weeks. The result of that is that close to 100,000 Canadians have kept their jobs because of that initiative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477049">I think the other thing we have to examine here is the significant improvements we made to the EI program. As a once very worthy political mentor of mine said, “Don't compare us against perfection. Compare us against the alternative”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477050">What I would point out is what the Liberal Party is advocating with respect to EI. It is advocating, as is the NDP, that there be a threshold of 360 hours. Three hundred and sixty hours, and then someone would be able to start collecting EI. Some people might find that to be attractive. However, that is an absolute disaster waiting to happen. It is fiscally irresponsible. What that means, if we break it down, is that anyone who works for 45 days, at 8 hours a day, can qualify for EI. The Liberal Party, quite frankly, does not even know how long those benefits might extend to. It could extend for up to a year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477051">I think anyone who suggests for a moment that a worker who works for 45 days and then goes on EI for up to a year, who thinks that is a legitimate and fiscally responsible program for Canadians, does not know what they are talking about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477052">What that means is that employers and employees will have to start paying more money. It is called a payroll tax. Someone has to pay for that. It is just one more tax that the Liberals are advocating.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477053">We know that the leader of the Liberal Party has said he would have to raise taxes to pay for the deficit. He has not told us yet exactly what taxes he would raise and who would pay them. We are starting now to get a glimpse of his plan. This is the first step in the Liberals' raising taxes regime. I expect there will be more to come. However, this is something that no Canadian should stand for. It is, pure and simple, the wrong approach. We do not raise taxes during a recession. That is the Liberal approach and it is the wrong approach.</ParaText>

Anything that they have done to change EI has been done begrudgingly because we have suggested it. Anything that is about caring for people and providing a social safety net is because we have suggested it. They do not understand the basic economics. Because if 420 hours is good for part of the country, it is good for all of the country. Are the Conservatives now going to cut the number of hours that everybody needs?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477060">Canadians voted for a Conservative government in the last election, not in spite of the recession but because of it. They know that a Conservative government is the only government that can deal with these tough economic problems we are facing today.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1477061">Mr. Speaker, I would like to continue on with some questioning. A number of weeks have passed since I asked the question about extending EI benefits to those who were prevented from fishing because of ice conditions. When the question was asked on April 22, the minister said that she understood what was happening with the ice conditions. She said that the employment of fishers was very important. She said, “We are looking after these individuals, and we will be addressing that situation very soon”. It sounded promising.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477062">Under some further questioning, as we got further into it, she said she had been working with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans on this very issue. At committee, just two days ago, the deputy minister of fisheries and oceans was asked if there were discussions between HRDC and Fisheries and Oceans. She said that there had been no discussions. There was not a problem with ice on the northeast coast of Newfoundland and Labrador.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477063">At our fisheries committee today, we had Earle McCurdy, a representative from the FFAW. We asked him about the ice conditions on the northeast coast of Newfoundland. Mr. McCurdy said he had received hundreds of emails and calls. There were harbours on the northeast coast that were blocked in by ice and there was still nothing forthcoming. The only solution that her department was going to have was that we should wait and wait. Eventually, the ice will melt and move off and we will not have to deal with it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477064">Let us ask the parliamentary secretary specific questions. Were there discussions? Why was due process not given to ice compensation? Now, he might go on and talk about extending the five extra weeks on employment insurance, because that is what the government did. I have some questions on that, too. The fact of the matter is that most of the clients were already getting the five extra weeks that the government said it was generously giving. There are 58 regions in the country. Thirty-six of those regions were already getting the five weeks, so we are only talking about less than 20 regions that were going to get the extra five weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477065">When the parliamentary secretary talks about the extra weeks, my second question is this. When this was announced in January, my sources tell me that this was only going to impact the 325,000 people who were on EI, which represents less than 25% of the total client base. Could he confirm these numbers and tell us exactly how many people were going to benefit from this initiative that they were already going to get anyway? There were already 10% unemployment levels in many regions of the country and there was more to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477066">It was going to happen anyway, but the government likes to say that the extra five weeks was a great thing and that it is doing a lot for EI. The fact of the matter is that it was going to happen anyway. Will the parliamentary secretary answer those two specific questions on employment insurance benefits?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1477067">Mr. Speaker, since the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128537" Type="2">Avalon</Affiliation> is relatively new to the House, I may need to repeat myself since he did not seem to hear the answers I gave to his colleague's questions a few moments ago. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477068">I am sorry I need to deal with this the odd time when I deal with members from the Liberal Party but since they are Liberals, I will try to speak slowly and distinctly so I can get the message across.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477069">We inherited the existing EI program from the Liberal Party. Any time I hear the Liberals complaining about the provisions contained in the EI program, it was their program to begin with. If what the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128537" Type="2">Avalon</Affiliation> said is true, why did his own party not address those very fundamental issues when it had 13 years to do it? It made no progress whatsoever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477070">When we took office prior to the 2008 election, we held widespread consultations with Canadians from coast to coast to coast looking for ways to improve on the EI system. We knew at that time that Canada and the rest of the world were facing a global economic crisis, a recession, a slowdown, the likes of which we had never seen before. We recognized that we needed to make some significant changes to the EI program to deal with the problems facing the country. What did we do? We started a consultation process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477071">Again, if we were to contrast that to what the Liberals would do, they would bring in programs without any consultation with stakeholders. That is not the approach the Conservative Party and our government takes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477072">What we heard during those consultations were three very basic elements. The first thing we heard was that we should extend the benefit period from 45 weeks to a longer period. During consultations, some of the opposition members suggested that we extend it by two weeks but we did more than double that. We extended the EI benefit period by 5 weeks, from 45 to 50 weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477073">The second thing we heard during consultations was that we needed to put more money into skills upgrading and job training. For those unfortunate souls who have lost their job and need to retrain, we decided to add $1.5 billion to increase job training and skills upgrading programs already in existence. That means that over $1 billion in new money is available for those people on EI to upgrade their skills and perhaps find a new craft so they can get back into the workplace as quickly as possible. Not only did we put $1 billion into the EI fund for training, we allocated $500 million for those people who did not qualify for EI so they could receive job training and skills upgrading.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477074">Finally, we heard that we needed to do something about our job share program so we did. This program has allowed over 100,000 people to retain their jobs and the employers to keep employing these people. We extended the work share program by 14 weeks to 52 weeks. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477075">Those are just a few of the improvements we made to the existing program, one that we inherited from the Liberals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477076">I would suggest to the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128537" Type="2">Avalon</Affiliation> to please not complain about the program that his party developed and we improved upon.</ParaText>

Therefore, I will take from his response that we were right, that here have been no discussions between the two departments on ice compensation and that nothing will be done for the fishers on the northeast coast of Newfoundland and Labrador. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477078">I would remind my hon. colleague that it was a Liberal government that started the pilot project prior to the Conservatives forming government. They can pat themselves on the back all they want about extending the five weeks, but the Liberal Party started this pilot project long before they got their hands on it.

The idea of advertising an investment as a grant and now saying that the repayment terms are generous is a little hard to swallow for the farmers in this country who are up to their eyeballs in debt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477143">I will ask the minister again, why was it advertised as an investment on the basis of it being a grant? Regardless of the repayment terms now, how can he justify that it is now a loan?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477161">Madam Chair, it is a pleasure to be here. It is always exciting to discuss agriculture in this great place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477162">I know the team around me is very well prepared. They have been serving agriculture and serving the farm gate to the best of their ability. We are blessed to have a great department. I certainly can attest to that. They serve farmers very well, because they and we all agree it is farmers first.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477163">It is always a pleasure and a privilege to bring matters of agriculture before this House, because agriculture, of course, does matter. It matters to the economy, it matters to the job market, and it matters to the health and well-being of all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477164">As we know, these main estimates are normally discussed in committee, not this setting of committee of the whole. However, in the current global economy the world needs a strong, profitable agricultural industry now more than ever. So I welcome this debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477165">The security and stability of our food supply starts with a strong, vibrant farm gate, and we have one. That is why all our programming puts farmers first. That was the focus of a recent G8 agricultural ministers meeting in Italy. I was proud to be there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477166">This government is working with producers to overcome the challenges they face, to build a stronger, more profitable agriculture sector in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477167"> As we have heard tonight, the H1N1 situation is a serious challenge for our pork industry. We have made it very clear to domestic consumers, as well as to our trading partners, that Canadian pork is safe and continues to be safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477168">The international scientific community, including the World Organisation for Animal Health and the World Health Organization, agrees that H1N1 is not a food safety issue. We will continue to reassure Canadian consumers and our international trading partners of that argument. We will keep working with our trading partners to make sure that trade decisions are based on sound science and the fact that our pork is safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477169">We will continue to stand with our pork producers and work with CPC to get our great industry back on track. I was proud to see the great show of support at our pork barbecue on Parliament Hill last week. This government is not afraid to take action at the WTO if the trade decisions made by our trading partners are not firmly rooted in sound science.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477170">We have shown that resolve by launching consultations with the United States over their mandatory idea for country of origin labelling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477171"> Our actions for the Canadian swine industry speak louder than words. We extended the time period covered by the cull breeding swine program, a program developed in conjunction with the industry. We have invested up to $76 million to help hog producers control disease. As part of this investment, in March we announced another $40 million to help producers develop and implement biosecurity best management practices, research projects and long-term disease risk management solutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477172">Our next generation of farm support programs are delivering more than $1 billion, some $1.3 billion, to livestock producers, including pork producers, for 2007-08. We are getting this money out quickly and effectively, thanks to AgriStability interim payments and targeted advance payments that we have reworked to be as farm friendly as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477173">We have extended emergency cash advances of up to $400,000, with the first $100,000 interest-free, a significant increase since we took office. That has delivered another $500 million in cashflow directly to the farm gate. At the request of livestock producers, I announced a stay of default for up to a year and a half on these loans. This stay covers almost $500 million in advances to the livestock sector. This government will continue to pay the interest on the first $100,000 through that period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477174">We are expanding slaughterhouse capacity with funding in the neighbourhood of $50 million. The government knows farmers want to make their money in the marketplace, not the mailbox. That is why we are getting out on the world stage to help them sell their great Canadian agricultural products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477175">We are working with the value chains. We have launched the market access secretariat to aggressively and proactively address market access challenges. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477176">A key component of our trade and market development program is the $88 million AgriMarketing program, which will help promote more of Canada's safe, high-quality, world-class products to a hungry world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477177">We continue helping producers weather the current economic storm. We are also looking to the future when those clouds clear. According to a recent analysis by the department, average net operating income of Canadian farmers rose by 27% between 1990 and 2006. Moreover, aggregate farm cash income is expected to increase again in the years 2007 to 2009.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477178">Over the past 10 years, the average total farm assets increased 38%, average net worth increased 41%, and the debt-to-asset ratio, as I have already said, has now risen by only three-quarters of 1%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477179">Producers do not want to stay in the same old rut. We cannot use yesterday's solutions to solve these new and emerging challenges. Farmers want to take advantage of the opportunities that are out there.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="25">(1925)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1477180">Our economic action plan for Canada will make sure businesses, including agriculture, come out of the current global situation stronger than ever. The economic action plan is building on a campaign promise by delivering $500 million through the agricultural flexibility plan. This new program will help farmers by promoting innovation, ensuring environmental sustainability and responding to the market challenges and opportunities. We are getting the job done for Canadian farm families, building stable, bankable, predictable programs, tapping new market opportunities at home and around the world and strengthening Canada's food safety system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477181">This government is delivering more resources and stronger regulations for that food safety system. We are investing in food safety after years of neglect and cuts. This government has invested another $113 million to enhance the safety and reliability of our systems. We have hired new food safety inspection personnel, an increase of some 14%, and we will hire more as needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477182">Budget 2009 allocated $250 million to address maintenance at federal labs, key links in Canada's health and food safety systems. We have initiated an independent investigation into last summer's recalls to find new ways to strengthen the system. We welcome the appointment of Sheila Weatherill, a very qualified lead investigator. We look forward to her recommendations as we continue to strengthen our food safety system. We also welcome the lessons learned introspective by all the other departments involved. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477183">This government continues to take a proactive approach to agricultural programs. We listen to farmers and we develop these programs. We now have a suite of stable, bankable programs to make sure farmers can weather economic storms and continue to help drive this economy. We continue to assess and analyze the impact of these programs and we have shown we will make adjustments when and where required.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477184">We are also looking to the future with industry. This government took action. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> announced this government's new legislation to guarantee an estimated $1 billion in new loans over the next five years for Canadian farm families and cooperatives. It will help beginning farmers take over the family farm, a very important point as we see the average age of farmers rise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477185">As the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said, “Farmers remain the backbone of the local economy for hundreds of communities throughout Canada. These farmers deserve to know that they can count on the credit they need to build and grow their operations”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477186">This government is making sure Canadian farmers have a firm foundation. We are creating the opportunities they need to succeed over the long term. Over the next five years, government is investing over $1 billion in the growing forward programs that are cost shared with the provinces and territories. Growing forward recognizes that every farm in every region is unique. The one size fits all programming is a thing of the past. The new suite of programs allows us to tailor programming to address regional needs. Flexibility is a key element of growing forward because that is the best way to make sure that every investment we make hits the target at the farm gate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477187">On top of my priorities this year to get a foot in the door with our key customers and build new markets around the world, as well as re-energize some relationships with our long-standing trade partners, I have said before that farmers do not want to farm the mailbox, they want to make their money in the marketplace that is where it is best. Farmers are not standing still and neither are we as a government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477188">This government is opening and expanding markets so that our farmers can sell more products to more customers around the world. Over the past few months, we have successfully reopened beef access in Hong Kong, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. We have worked to expand pulse markets in India. We are keeping up the pressure with trade missions to Morocco last month and other key markets in the coming weeks and months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477189">We have signed free trade agreements with the European Free Trade Association, Peru and Colombia. Of course, we continue to build a respectful relationship with our biggest trading partner to the south, the United States, as well as with Mexico and Japan. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477190">Every time we resolve a trade irritant or expand the market, we are adding to the strong bottom line for Canadian farm families. We are making sure our producers can continue to drive the Canadian economy as we all face the current global economic uncertainty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477191">To close, I want to thank all the portfolio team in agriculture for doing a great job of advancing the sector. On a whole range of issues we are working together to help producers and the whole value chain to proactively capture those new opportunities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477192">Madam Chair, I listened with great interest to the minister as he outlined some of the programs and projects that our government is implementing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477193">I come from a riding that has a strong agricultural base. It is quite diverse; there is everything from cow-calf operations to canola, wheat, and coarse grain operations. There is a wide variety of different farming endeavours.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477194">I was invited by a number of farmers to a meeting a short time ago. I went there with some concern as to what I might hear. I was pleasantly surprised by their remarks about some of the changes that have been made in the last three years to some of the farm programs. In fact, I will not forget one of the comments that was made, which is that the programs have never been this good since the days of John Diefenbaker. I would like to pass that on to the minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477195">There is a question that farmers want me to ask the minister. He touched on it in the last part of his remarks, but I would like him to elaborate on it. They are concerned about the protectionist tendencies in the United States. They really do not want to depend on farm programs, even though they have been improved. They would like to know what other endeavours the minister is engaged in and what these mean to the farmers' bottom line.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477196">My question is really twofold. What is being done to continue to ensure we have access to markets in the United States? What is the minister doing other than that to ensure that our farmers can get more returns from the marketplace?</ParaText>

I have had the opportunity to attend some of the round tables he has held in Yorkton over the years and they are always great fountains of information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477198">Certainly there is concern. He said that the last time farmers had access to good programming was under John Diefenbaker. That speaks to the age of farmers out there. It underscores that line.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477199">We are certainly working hard to reinvigorate markets. The United States is our major trading partner. It is the closest one to us and there has been a free flow of information and goods back and forth, which has been especially underscored since NAFTA. That certainly expedited a great deal of income for farmers with that new free trade agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477200">We have to be vigilant. We have to make sure that the free trade is also fair trade, that the rules are embraced and followed. We continue to work with our American counterparts regardless of what political side they are on. I have developed a good relationship with my colleague, Tom Vilsack, the new secretary of agriculture. I know my colleague, the <Affiliation DbId="128690" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation>, has that same good camaraderie and working relationship with Ron Kirk, the secretary of trade.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477201">We continue to work with them on how to get past this country of origin labelling situation in which they have found themselves. We continue to work with them on ways forward. We put one challenge in place that gave us the rule that we needed changed. The final rule came out in the script that we wanted it. Then the new administration added a little more voluntary and a little more mandatory, which is creating a lot of frustration. We have initiated the second challenge on that one and we will work with our American allies on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477202">At the same time that we are working to reinvigorate that trade, we are opening new trade corridors around the world. Of course, we all look with envy at the Pacific Rim and the great job that is done by some countries, like Australia and so on. We have been out of that picture for a number of years. For the last year and a half to two years we have begun to reinvigorate those channels, pulse crops in India, pulse crops in Morocco. There is a lot more grain going into Saudi Arabia than ever we have seen before as it steps back from self-sufficiency and buys the good quality durum wheat from Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477203">We are also beginning discussions with the EU. Of course, with 300 million people over there, it is a tremendous opportunity for Canadian producers. I know they look to us to lead the challenge on that, to level the playing field so they can go industry to industry and make the good deals to further the farm gate.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477207">Madam Chair, that is such a great question because as we do build the volumes going out, we have to address what customers are asking for. The Pacific Rim countries are saying that they are looking for age verification so they can sell that great product in their countries of record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477208">Having said that, we are a national government. We want to make sure we have national standards. We do not want to see one province moving ahead of others. I certainly welcome the time that Alberta has put into this because it does have some 45% of the beef herd, and so I welcome that intervention.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1477209">Madam Chair, I must say that there is one thing I am delighted with tonight. However, I will immediately reassure my colleagues, it is not the contents of the minister's speech. I am delighted because, for once, the minister will have to give me an answer. For quite some time, actually several months, I have been asking him questions in the House about Quebec agriculture and the <Affiliation DbId="128684" Type="4">Minister of State (Agriculture)</Affiliation> has been answering for him. I would say to the minister that, in all honesty, Quebec farmers feel that they have been abandoned by the real Minister of Agriculture. This evening, he will have no choice but to give me an answer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477210">When I stated that I was not delighted with his speech, it is because once again he made an optimistic speech in which he attempted to sell us his policies and vision for agriculture. This is the government approach to most issues: it packages them and attempts to sell them with some marketing. We know that they use negative advertising to attack their opponents. We know that they also use marketing to try to sell their policies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477211">That is exactly what happened before the budget. The minister will no doubt recall that he made a public announcement before the budget. I did not think that was allowed, but many ministers made announcements concerning their respective portfolios before the budget, completely divulging the contents of the budget and its various aspects. This minster also did the same thing with the program they had the nerve to call AgriFlex.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477212">For some time now, the provinces have been asking for greater flexibility in the programs. Quebec did, as did the Union des producteurs agricoles, of course, and so did all of Canada. The Canadian Federation of Agriculture, and particularly the grain producers of Quebec and Ontario, were asking for this kind of program. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477213">The minister managed to make the front page of certain agricultural newspapers, announcing that there would be a new program, the AgriFlex program. However, as I always say—and as I told journalists after we all saw the budget and of course noticed the major shortfalls in that announcement—the devil is in the details. There were no income security support measures. It was not at all what all the farmers were expecting. What they wanted was a real, flexible program to meet the needs of the provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477214">First of all, can the minister explain to me why his program has been reduced from $500 million over four years, as promised, to $500 million over five years? How is that only $190 million in new money was injected into the program? So the rest will come from the department. Is the minister going to make cuts somewhere? I would like to know, and our farmers would also like to know. Where will he cut in order to find the money needed, that is, the $310 million that is lacking? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477215">Can the minister also tell me why he did not include farm income support? How could he have possibly believed that that would be accepted? Once the marketing is done and something is passed off as “new and improved”, once people buy the product, see what it really is and taste it, in my opinion, whoever produced it could face some problems, because the consumer is not going to be happy. That is exactly what happened with this. Those are my questions for the minister at this time. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477216">Madam Chair, there were a number of issues. I certainly act with respect toward the member opposite. When my colleague the <Affiliation DbId="128684" Type="4">Minister of State for Agriculture</Affiliation>, also the <Affiliation DbId="128683" Type="4">Minister of National Revenue</Affiliation>, which is a great combination, answers questions in question period, he respects the francophone language and so forth. He does a tremendous job representing agriculture producers in Quebec and the rest of Canada in his role, as I feel I do in my federal role as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477217">We meet constantly with farm groups from Quebec. I had a meeting a short time ago with Christian Lacasse, the leader of the UPA in Quebec. I met a few days ago with Laurent Pellerin, who is with the Canadian Federation of Agriculture. I meet all the time with the province's minister, Laurent Lessard, who was reinstated in his position after the election in Quebec. It was a tremendous opportunity to work with him again. He is a solid man and very much onside with Quebec agriculture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477218">I am not sure what the member opposite is talking about. Various members of our government have hosted a number of round tables in Quebec. We are fortunate to have tremendously strong representation from rural Canada. We have the numbers and we have the background. We have producers in this place who make the necessary changes to ensure the farm gate is secure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477219">We do not see provincial lines maybe the same as the Bloc does. We try to develop programs that are fair and reasonable and work well across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477220">The member specifically talked about agricultural flexibility and the budget. It should have come as no surprise to him or anyone else because that was a campaign pledge. This government is nothing if not solid and secure in following through on what we say we are going to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477221">We said we were going to discount the GST, and we have done that. I had a schedule. It is down two points. When we talk about tax cuts, that is great news for farmers because they pay taxes too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477222">It should come as no surprise for the member opposite that we followed through on agricultural flexibility. We had some discussions with industry groups. There are certain ones that want to see that dumped in on top of the business risk suite, but there is no need to do that. We have a tremendous suite of programs, under business risk, that will trigger in when farmers need it the most. We have seen that happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477223">We needed a proactive pillar, and that is what agricultural flexibility is. It will commercialize good ideas, find new ways to push innovation and cut input costs, all those great things that farmers have asked us to do but were never able to fund under the old suite of programs, which were so narrowly focused under the APF.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477224">Under growing forward, we have the reactive programming. Under agricultural flexibility, we will have the proactive programming to help farmers move forward.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477225">Madam Chair, I am stunned to hear the minister say that he does not know what I am talking about. What I am saying is very clear. I am simply saying that his government did not keep its promises.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477226">I do not know where he was during the election campaign. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s office had likely asked him not to show his face too much because of the listeriosis crisis. But his party, the Conservative Party, had promised to introduced a real, flexible program for Quebec and the provinces, which the Canadian Federation of Agriculture and the UPA had called for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477227">He can meet with Christian Lacasse. I meet with him as well, and I am certain that my colleagues in the other parties meet with him too, just as we meet with representatives of farm producers everywhere, in all sectors. What did Christian Lacasse say after the budget was passed? What did he say when the government failed to keep its promise to introduce a flexible program, which the minister dared call AgriFlex in his budget? He said:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477229">Christian Lacasse said that not long ago, on January 27, 2009. The minister can meet with him. Even though I will not be at the meeting, I am sure that Mr. Lacasse will remind him that he did not keep his promise. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477230">My question is as follows. I will repeat it, because he says he does not know what I am talking about. When will there be a real, flexible program that includes risk management? It should not be excluded, which is what the minister did. Why did he exclude it? He did not tell me that either. When will the Conservatives keep the promise they made during the election campaign, just before they brought down the budget? When the budget was brought down, it no longer included the necessary measures.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477231">Madam Chair, the member opposite made a comment about me disappearing during the election, but I remember being part of a debate. The Canadian Federation of Agriculture put on a tremendous debate every election. We had that down the street at the Chateau. I was on the panel for some two, two and a half, hours, but I do not remember the Bloc having a representative there at all. The member should be careful to whom he points his finger. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477232">Talking about the future of agriculture, as the member opposite did, there are two different ways to approach it. The one way is to keep farmers reliant on the mailbox. That is not what they want. What they want is a full blown, market access type of situation. They want to access that and they want to do it in a proactive way, with the new innovative ways with which farmers come up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477233">Farmers are nothing, if not good stewards of the land. They produce the safest, most secure food supply in the world, bar none. We will all agree on that. I think all of us support agriculture in our own way. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477234">That is the great thing about democracy. There is always divergence of opinions, but there is a convergence of what needs to be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477235"> I take what the member opposite said, but I know when he talks directly to farmers in Quebec, as do many of my colleagues who represent farmers in Quebec, he will also hear the other side of the coin. They are happy to see a government get past the old ideas of sending them a cheque to keep them in mediocrity, allowing them, in our programming, to break the mould and get out in the world with some new innovative ideas. We are constantly doing that. We are helping farmers get their feet under themselves, not forcing them to take that cheque from the mailbox and holding them back.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477239">Madam Chair, I would remind the minister that, in many cases, the Bloc Québécois does support government measures or ones from the other opposition parties. Very recently, we passed Bill <Document DbId="3850776" Type="3">C-29</Document>, which is so dear to the heart of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> that once again he made an announcement before it was passed by the House. That is funny, because in committee today the Conservative members sabotaged the clause by clause study; it did not even take place. The minister will have to explain that to the farmers. The Prime Minister himself was singing the praises of this bill to them and I would point out again that the Bloc Québécois was absolutely in favour of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477240">The same thing happened when it came time to help the swine producers and livestock producers in general. A week after the minister introduced Bill <Document DbId="3293100" Type="3">C-44</Document>, not only did the Bloc Québécois vote in favour of it, but we initiated an emergency debate in the House to help those people out. A week after that, the minister came along with Bill C-44. I even had the opportunity to speak with him about it and we were in agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477241">It is wrong to say that the Bloc is always opposed to everything and that it blocks every bill. The Conservatives can do what they did in the last election campaign, travel around in a bus and badmouth the Bloc, but we saw the election results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477242">I have one more question, and it concerns Levinoff-Colbex. Will the minister make sure that this company receives its fair share of the $50 million they announced for the slaughter industry?</ParaText>

I can assure members that we are very serious about getting this through, ensuring that $1 billion in new credit, especially for new, beginning farmers, gets out there. We have been told that some new farmers in Quebec want to take advantage of this.</ParaText>

However, the point I made about the Bloc is that those members run hot and cold on certain issues, but at the end of the day, they have not supported the budget which would flow the money and make it accessible to Levinoff-Colbex and everybody else across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477245">Certainly we are aware of the situation at Levinoff-Colbex and we are working with it. It would have been a lot easier to get that job done earlier if members of the Bloc would have supported the budget, got it to committee, got the job done, instead of always being an anchor.

When he announced the $50 million for the slaughter industry, it was definitely not a question of loans. Now farmers in Quebec, who just put $30 million into their slaughterhouses, are being told that, actually, it will be a loan and not a subsidy. Many slaughterhouses across Canada managed to get subsidies, but Levinoff-Colbex never received a single red cent.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477249">Madam Chair, the member opposite is certainly mixing a lot of different issues. Personally I am not aware of any slaughter house that received a subsidy. Under the former Liberal government program, it would have to go broke in order to trigger some money. That is what the Liberals put forward during the BSE crisis, which was not helpful to anyone. It did back stop the banks, which maybe was the intention of the Liberals all along. I do not know.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477252">Madam Chair, could the minister talk a little about the cattle industry? We have had some questions on that and I will continue. Hopefully I will be quick and precise and we can get some precise answers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477253">Many people have tried to analyze why there is a crisis in the cattle industry. We have many reports and many people meeting at committee. A report by the National Farmer Union contained a number of recommendations, and I personally handed it to the minister .</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477254">One of the recommendations is we should probably look at doing away with it captive supply, which is apparently happening in the United States. Is there consideration for this? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477255">According to the report, although exports have tripled in the last 20 years, the money that cattle producers are making is less than half of what they made 20 years ago, yet we are exporting more and we are opening up more markets. I will give the minister and the department credit for that. We need to open up more markets, but there is obviously something else happening as to why producers are not making money. Is the minister looking at other alternatives?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477256">My next question is this. We keep talking about the COOL and the regulations the Americans are enforcing. We are doing our best to try to resolve that situation. I often ask, what if? Do we have a plan B if ultimately at the end of the day the Americans do not budge on their COOL regulations? We need to have some kind of other plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477257">Tied in with this are the slaughter houses, the money available and the programs that happen in provinces. In my province of British Columbia a lot of small producers have been hit hard because of the standardization and the pressure they perceive comes from CFIA and the federal government. Is there any thought at looking at some flexibility for small producers, which we can pass on to the provinces?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477258">Madam Chair, what the member means by captive supply is that cattle are owned by the facility that ultimately is going to slaughter and sell them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477259"> They do have a situation in the U.S. that they are addressing at this time. We do not have that situation in Canada. With the dissolution of Tyson at Brooks, Alberta, which had a 75,000-head feedlot that it filled or did not fill depending upon volumes and accessibility, this was very much checked, audited , looking at where the money went and so forth, after BSE, and it was found that it did not use that in a captive supply way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477260">Having said that, I know Cargill does offer a bonus. It contracts with farmers to get certain marbling, size and so forth, and that gives those farmers a premium. That is the good thing that happens when a processor works with producers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477261">In Alberta and some of the industry in western Canada, they are working to have better records from the slaughter facility that will redirect producers to grow better beef. I think that is a holistic approach to what is required.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477262">I did read the NFU report, and I had the same feeling about that report as the Canadian Cattlemen's Association. The end result might have been workable, but how they got there is not. It requires a rationalization of the industry that would take out every small town that has a beef operation anywhere near it. It would take out all the farm machinery dealerships. There would be collateral damage that was not in the report. We will not go there. This is a market-driven industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477263">The member is right to point out the problems, the trials and tribulations that country of origin labelling is giving, especially in our livestock sector. This is not for the processed beef; this is directed at the live beef that goes south. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477264"> It is a huge problem for the American industry as well, because they rely on a good percentage of solid Canadian product going there to give them a solid bottom line. They are as upset as we are. We are working on the American administration, from both sides, to make positive change.</ParaText>

The international scientific community, including the OIE and the WHO, agrees that influenza A(H1N1) has nothing to do with food safety. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477315">We will continue reassuring Canadian consumers and our international trade partners that Canadian pork is safe.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477316"> The government is determined to ensure the success of Canadian agriculture. The government does everything it can to make sure Canadian farmers succeed and to ensure a prosperous future for the whole sector. It puts farmers first in every decision it makes in agriculture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477317">Our formula is simple and it works. We listen to farmers, we work with farmers, and then we deliver the bankable, practical results that farmers need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477318">The minister has been on the road a lot these past months, and his efforts to build trade relations are indeed paying off. We signed a deal in India to safeguard market access for our pulse producers. We landed a breakthrough deal in Hong Kong, which can create export opportunities worth some $26 million for Canadian beef producers. We have gone to the Middle East to reopen markets such as Saudi Arabia and Jordan to Canadian beef, for the first time in five years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477319">Step by step, the Conservative government and the minister are reopening markets to Canadian producers, which previous Liberal governments and the former parliamentary secretary, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128358" Type="2">Malpeque</Affiliation>, ignored and neglected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477320">The strategy is already building momentum, and it is sending a strong message to the rest of the global community that it is time their consumers once again enjoy our top quality Canadian products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477321">We want Canadian farmers and processors to get the credit they deserve for the high-quality products they bring to market. Our agricultural exporters are innovative and competitive, and we are working with them to expand their markets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477322"> On April 7, we launched a new trade and market development program, part of the new growing forward agricultural framework. This program is part of growing forward, the policy framework for agriculture. The goal is to make sure exporters have the information and support they need to sell more products in more markets. By focusing attention on how we market our products, we are helping to build demand for Canadian goods and enhancing our competitive position.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477323">In January, we announced the establishment of a market access secretariat. This measure came directly out of the recommendations made by the beef-cattle and pork value chain roundtables.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477324">The secretariat will better coordinate government initiatives with producers and the industry and will help keep pace with international competitors. The creation of the secretariat has been very well received by producers. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1477325">Agricultural trade is critical to Canada's economy and prosperity. In 2008 our agriculture and agri-food exports were over $38 billion. Importantly, Canada's trade in agriculture and agri-food products contributed $11.1 billion to our trade surplus. Each of those dollars means jobs and livelihoods for Canadians right here at home. That is why when we as a government take measures to support agricultural trade, we are not just helping farmers. We are helping all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477326">This government is working through the World Trade Organization. We are working one-on-one with our trading partners to build bilateral and regional agreements, and we are working with industry, all with the common goal of building our agricultural trade and opening up new opportunities for our farmers and processors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477327">At the WTO, we remain committed to pursuing an ambitious outcome for the benefit of Canadian farmers and their families. We want an outcome that establishes a more level international playing field and provides new opportunities for our producers, processors and exporters. Our objectives at the WTO remain the elimination of all forms of export subsidies and the substantial reduction of and strengthened disciplines on trade-distorting domestic support, and real and significant improvements to market access.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477328">Complimenting our efforts at the WTO, this Conservative government is also pursuing an active regional and bilateral trade negotiation agenda. In recent months, Canada has signed free trade agreements with the countries of the European Free Trade Association as well as Peru and Colombia. The agreements with Peru and Colombia will benefit a wide range of agriculture and agri-food stakeholders such as the grains, oilseeds, pulses, pork and beef exporters.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477330">In addition, the recent launch of official negotiations with the European Union bodes well for Canadian agriculture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477331">The European Union is Canada's second-largest trade and investment partner, as the $6.3 billion in bilateral trade in agri-food in 2008 attests. We want to strengthen that relationship and make it more profitable for our farmers.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1477332">Through these negotiations, Canada looks forward to exploring new and expanded opportunities for Canadian agricultural exporters and farmers. As we move forward, we will continue to consult closely with the entire agriculture industry regarding how best to advance Canada's interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477333">The links between Canada and our largest trading partner, the United States, are deep, diverse and complex. We share a common border that stretches across nearly 9,000 kilometres of land and three oceans. We share the world's largest trading relationship. It has been said that every minute, $1 million in trade happens somewhere along the Canada-U.S. border. The free flow of goods is critical to our agricultural sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477334">Canada's farmers depend on free and unfettered trade for their livelihoods. Our trade relationship reaps many rewards for Canada's agricultural sector. Unlike previous Liberal governments, this Conservative government is working to improve our historic relationship with the U.S. through a respectful dialogue instead of the childish attacks and insults. In doing so, Canada's Conservative government is working to improve and expand U.S. markets for cattle, hog and other agricultural products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477335">We are pulling out all the stops to fight mandatory country of origin labelling, or COOL, in the United States. Mandatory COOL will stifle trade with the <?bk?>U.S.,<?ek?> especially for Canada's cattle and hog industries. We have consistently made it clear that current mandatory COOL regulations unfairly disadvantage Canadian producers. We are now requesting a further round of WTO consultations with the U.S. regarding mandatory country of original labelling.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477342">A number of great statements have been made about our tackling of market access, the development of the new market access secretariat, which is a combination of trade relations and sound science that is administered by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. It is well recognized around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477343">When I go country by country re-opening markets I am constantly asked, “Where has Canada been?” Australia has been aggressive. The Americans have been aggressive. Even the EU has been aggressive marketers of its products. Where has Canada been?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477344">It is tough to explain that we had 10 or 13 years where it did not matter what agriculture did. Programs drove trade down. It shrank. We relied more on the American market. We have to get past that. We have to work harder on these other markets, and we are doing that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477345">Other countries and organizations welcome our top quality Canadian products. The consistency and quality of the supply is second to none. We are not just bragging about our own products. Other countries are talking about top quality Canadian products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477346">In the course of hard red western wheat, of course countries use it around the world to blend to make the other stuff that they buy cheaply palatable, and they will continue to do that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477347">I had the opportunity to visit some pasta and flour mills in Morocco that use an inordinate amount of Canadian product. They like it. They are happy with the consistency of the Canadian product. I was dismayed at what they called a number one in the sample bag from our Canadian Wheat Board, but I will take that up with Wheat Board officials in the coming weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477348">Every industry is buoyed by the fact that we are reopening those markets. We are becoming less reliant. We are putting less eggs in that American basket, if the House will excuse the pun. However, we continue to work with our American neighbours to make sure that the free flow of goods is fair and that their restrictions are not affecting our producers in a negative way. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477349">We have also begun to work a lot more closely with the Koreans to access their market. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477350">We are not scared to go to the WTO. Rules-based trade is where everyone should be. Canada was a great contender at the table in Geneva, making our argument, and making sure that we had access to those new markets while we safeguarded our domestic systems here at home. It is a great responsibility, but one that I share with my colleague the <Affiliation DbId="128690" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation>.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1477353">Certainly the easiest way to explain that, Madam Chair, is the more people we have bidding on our product, the better the price will be. There is a demand out there and we are seeing that on the global stage. We are also seeing it domestically.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477354">One thing that producers need access to is to lift themselves a little further up that food chain rung and start to value add. We have certain sectors of our society that are not allowed to do that in a way that is cost effective. We have others that are. We look at those with envy from western Canada of course. I am sure we will have a little more debate on that particular enterprise later tonight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477355">Having said that, I am always buoyed by farmers wanting to take on the challenge to broaden their scope, to actually do more with their product, to diversify.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477356">I know the members opposite make a big thing out of farm debt, but a good portion of that farm debt is because farmers are diversifying. They are changing to the new ways of doing things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477357">The young guys who are farming my land, and they cover now some 32,000 acres, use 65 foot air seeders. That scope of equipment was unheard of even a decade ago and GPS controlled steering up and down fields. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477358">I had a great opportunity last fall, as I helped open a new ethanol facility in western Canada, to go for a ride on one of the new John Deere combines. This thing had a 36 foot header on it. We were running up and down a field with 55 to 60 bushel utility wheat at nine miles an hour and just floating along. The header is moving independently and the GPS is steering the combine. The innovation and the intensity of agriculture in this country now is phenomenal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477359">We still have smaller farmers who are doing very well. They tend to be more diversified and they offer us a good cross-section of top quality product. I commend them for the job they are doing too.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477361">I might just say to begin with, on the issue related to market access and market development, that the important effort on behalf of Canada in this regard did not just begin in the last year or two or three. The minister might want to look at the important history of his department and the work of veteran public servants, such as Michelle Comeau and Michael Gifford and a range of others, who have given Canada a great foundation upon which to build in terms of access to markets around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477362">Tonight I want to especially ask the minister about the PFRA, the Prairie Farmer Rehabilitation Administration. Established in 1935 and headquartered in Regina, PFRA became and remains the single most successful and most respected agency of the Government of Canada in the west. Its expertise was second to none in soil conservation, water supply systems, irrigation, flood protection, pasture management, shelter belts, ground cover, community development and much more. It was hands on and it was trusted.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477366">We folded everything together into the Agri-Environment Services Branch. PFRA is the lead role in that. It is doing a tremendous job. We use it internationally now, when it talks about water conservancy and grassland management around the world. That is the great role that it is playing. We have broadened that scope. We are happy to do that. We are proud to do that. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477369">I would advise the minister that the PFRA has been international and functioning internationally for years. It has been a lead agency for CIDA in implementing foreign aid projects, especially in Africa. It was also the agency called in by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers back when the Mississippi had the great flood back in the 1990s. So PFRA has been international for a long time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477370">As the attrition of PFRA continues, decision-making authority has essentially been removed from the headquarters operation in Regina and centralized in Ottawa. When PFRA people in Regina retire, their positions go vacant and they are not replaced. Attrition is indeed well underway. This is clearly the plan, to let it wither on the vine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477371">Will the minister specifically reverse this and run the department's environmental programs from Regina? Why not? There is no impediment to that. Why does the PFRA centre of excellence and expertise have to be the victim here?</ParaText>

I want to acknowledge the minister's willingness to be here tonight and his patience with the questions he has been asked. The knowledge that he shows on his files and portfolio has been outstanding and very impressive. I would also like to acknowledge the team that works with him on the ag committee. It is a team of very knowledgeable people. One of the things I notice about the caucus on this side of the House as opposed to the other side is that we have farmers over here. We have producers. We have people who work on the ground, who work the land. It seems to be very difficult to find any of those on the other side.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477420">The challenge we face is how we allow our farmers to be competitive.

Under the strong leadership of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="111560" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food</Affiliation>, the Government of Canada will continue to fight for farmers' freedom. The government will keep working with western Canadian grain farmers to ensure that they get the freedom they want.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477421">We are going to continue to work to ensure transparency for producers and taxpayers as well. I am going to talk about that later. The CWB had significant losses in the financial markets in the 2007-08 marketing year. There has been no public performance review of the programs that caused those losses. I would like to look at CWB's ability to market grain. There is a lot of emotion attached to this issue. The best thing we could do is look at the results that have been studied that show what the Canadian Wheat Board is actually doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477422">The Data Transmission Network, or DTN, has been an innovator in production and delivery of news and information since 1984. It is a trusted source that gathers agricultural information and publishes it. The DTN tells us that the average of U.S. elevator bid prices shows that for the last three years, the Canadian Wheat Board has earned less than farmers south of the border. This is one of the reasons western Canadian farmers are very unhappy with their marketing situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477423">In 2007-08, the Wheat Board's final price on red spring with 13.5% protein was $1.70 a bushel below the U.S. average market price for similar wheat. The year before, the Wheat Board final was $1.17 per bushel below. The year before that, the Wheat Board again fell short of the U.S. average price by about 70¢ a bushel. I want to point out that it went from 70¢ to $1.17. Last year when the Wheat Board was touting itself as a huge success story, its final wheat price was actually $1.70 a bushel below the average posted in the United States.</ParaText>

If we cannot compare numbers, maybe we could look at one of the studies that has been done about the Wheat Board and mention a few of the facts here so that the member for <Affiliation DbId="128358" Type="2">Malpeque</Affiliation> after all these years may finally come to understand the pain and suffering that western Canadian farmers really endure because of that organization.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477426">The Informa study, which was put out in June 2008, has been recognized and well accepted. It showed that the Wheat Board earned no premium for farmers. U.S. farmers actually received higher prices for spring wheat in five of the last six years. Our farmers are at a competitive disadvantage to U.S. farmers in five out of six years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477427"> Canadian Wheat Board spring wheat pool returns have been on the average of about $16 per tonne below North Dakota's prices. That is about 50¢ a bushel on average. That is a big difference for farmers. It adds up to a lot of money on their farms. Durum returns have been $12 a tonne below North American prices. U.S. farmers received higher malt barley prices. That is really frustrating because there is no one in this country who understands the malt barley marketing system in western Canada who believes that the Wheat Board is doing a good job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477428">If the people at the Wheat Board could find a way out of it, I think even they themselves would like to get out of that because they know they are not doing a good job for farmers. By contrast, in the last eight years on the free market, canola prices received by Canadian farmers have been higher than canola prices received by U.S. farmers. That shows that when our farmers are put in a situation where they can compete, they actually do well. They were actually stronger than the U.S. farmers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477429">I would like to talk about last year in particular, because farmers paid a huge price for this marketing system. Last year the Canadian Wheat Board lost over $300 million in its trading activities. It was farmers who were forced to take these losses because the Wheat Board does not pay for its mistakes. It does not have to, because it has someone to do that for it and that is the western Canadian farmers. The Wheat Board managed to lose $90 million from its producer payment options. It is called a contingency fund. It has been set up to handle these producer payment option programs. It lost $90 million in its trading in that fund. Even worse than that, in its regular discretionary trading, it lost another $226 million. I guess the conclusion most western Canadian farmers have reached is that the Canadian Wheat Board is just too expensive for them. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477430">We believe that producers deserve to see a public arm's length review of the Canadian Wheat Board. That would be reasonable. It lost $300 million in its trading activity. It would be reasonable to ask that there be some sort of review.

              <ParaText id="1477443">As the <Affiliation DbId="111560" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food</Affiliation> has said often, entrepreneurs need as many options as possible to market and sell their goods. This has never been more true than in today's economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477444">We want farmers to have the freedom to choose whether to sell grain on the open market or through the Canadian Wheat Board. We believe that farmers deserve to have the ability to add value to their crops and capture more profits beyond the farm gate. </ParaText>

They take all the risks, make all the investments and they should be able to have complete control of the marketing of their own products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477446">A Canadian Wheat Board monopoly on wheat was imposed by Parliament because of a variety of dynamics and reasons over 70 years ago. The barley monopoly is over 60 years old and today's market realities are vastly different. Today there are numerous new and growing exporters and export markets around the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477447">We have moved away from the commodity procurement of the past where we just had bulk amounts of grain grown, bulk amounts sold and bulk amounts delivered to a situation in which a large number of mainly private buyers want to be able to select a range of quality attributes for particular market segments. This niche development is taking place everywhere. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477448">In fact, the other day in the agriculture committee Dr. Brian Fowler talked about how many of the varieties that are being developed in Saskatoon and elsewhere in Saskatchewan cannot be used in Canada because of the Canadian Wheat Board marketing system. Our good friends in Montana and other American states get to benefit from the research that is done in our country because of our marketing system.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477453">Madam Chair, there are a number of situations that underscore it, including the gun registry. One could lump all three of the parties in with that failed system, too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477454">The problem one sees with programs that are out of date and are 60 or 70 years old on marketing barley, is that one cannot address today's challenges with yesterday's programs. One just cannot do that, and farmers are the first to say so. The problem we have is that the Wheat Board then maybe filled a role that government saw, but it never filled a role that farmers saw. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477455">The Wheat Board has become a monopoly buyer, not a monopoly seller. Over half of the product it now buys on paper is exported or used domestically by the line companies, even by the independent terminals. It is a monopoly buyer, not a monopoly seller. When the member pointed out the numbers, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128358" Type="2">Malpeque</Affiliation> took exception to them, but those are quantifiable numbers. They are there. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477456">Farmers are on the Internet. Years ago when the government first talked about high-speed Internet access, farmers were the first ones to leap on that, whether through satellite, dial-up, whatever, so they could check what their American cousins were doing. We have a number of farmers who farm on both sides of the border, so we know those comparisons are accurate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477457">In western Canada we are missing the ability to value add in an efficient way. Right now we have an arcane system where one has to phone the board and say, “I have 5,000 bushels of barley I want to take to Biggar”, which is 40 miles from where I live. I trucked it myself. I paid freight and elevation to tide water. I had to do a buy-back from the board and I had not even loaded it onto my truck yet. That is the ridiculous situation we find. If we had a little thing called property rights in this country, it would take care of a lot of that, too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477458"> We are not allowed to value add. There is a 500,000 tonne shortfall of malt barley globally. We grow the best malt barley anywhere in the world in western Canada, and we are not allowed to make it into malt because we cannot get by that little hurdle called the Canadian Wheat Board.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477459">We have tried. We did a plebiscite; we did a referendum, if one wants to call it that, which is required by the act. Sixty-two per cent of farmers responded by saying that the status quo is not good enough, that we have to move beyond. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477460">The Wheat Board asks very similar questions all the time. The same responses came back with very similar numbers. It said it would address this by coming up with a new program called cash plus. It tried to develop a program where it would give farmers most of their money upfront. It did that, and farmers would not buy into it because it is too restrictive, too narrow in focus like the old farm programs were.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477461">The Wheat Board, to save itself and win the public relations war, tried to develop new programs. The member alluded to the losses in the contingency fund, which is what backstops those new programs. It was $40 million a couple of years ago. The board had an introspective look done on it called the Gibson report, and the board felt it had everything fixed. What happened last year? It lost two-and-a-half times as much after it said it had everything fixed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477462">The Wheat Board just cannot understand this free market idea. Its analysis is somehow flawed. That leads to the reality in western Canada that the Wheat Board is becoming less than viable. We talk about its not being cost effective and not being cost efficient, and it is losing market share. Any one of us who lives there can say this, and the numbers will bear this out, that it does not have the acres signed over to wheat, durum and barley that it used to have, simply because farmers are making the move into other crops, such as pulse crops and canola, which have become world class, developed right out of the western provinces, for that matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477463">Farmers are not scared about marketing those products themselves. They have done well. As I said, they built world-class products to do that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477464">At committee today I heard the Wheat Board itself allude to the fact that there are some real problems with its voters list. We saw that in the last election. There are a tremendous number of voters who produce absolutely nothing and still have access to a ballot. There are another 42%, some 84,000 voters who are on that list, who produce less than what would come off of one field, less than a B train of product. Twenty per cent of the farmers control 80% of the votes, and that is an untenable situation. We will seek to rectify that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477465">Mr. Chair, a rather unusual situation has arisen in my riding. A weather station in Stanstead is managed by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada as well as by the organization responsible for agricultural insurance in Canada. However, it is included in Environment Canada's budget. This station is used to take hydrometry readings for hay fields.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477466">Two years ago, we had a great deal of rain and many farmers lost their hay crops. When farmers applied for compensation to the appropriate organization in Canada, only one person was refused. The problem was that she lived next door to a neighbour who had a fence and the weather station covers a certain area. When the Financière agricole du Québec went to check out this situation, it found that the weather station was in a stand of maples. The hydrometer could not measure the amount of rain because the station was tucked away among the maples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477467">Everyone, except for that lady, was reimbursed or compensated. Since the equipment is not in the right place and is hidden in a building, will the minister move this weather station and then be able to provide fair compensation for hay producers?</ParaText>

When I was on the committee, even though I am not a farmer, I asked the chair whether sugar cane is grown in Canada. She answered that all sugar is imported from Cuba. The minister tells me that there is sugar in Alberta. I hope it is not oil sands sugar. She told me that sugar cane is not grown in Canada. That is why the 98% rule is not acceptable. I remember that in committee even the Conservatives voted for the 85% rule.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477478">The option of 85% certainly was considered, but what consumers were asking for was more than that. Processors will always say that it is too much, but it is the consumers we were addressing with this particular one. Consumers, on the other end of the scale, are saying that is where they want to go; that is the number that should be there. The 98% allows for spices, sugar, salt and all those other things. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477479">We even produce salt in this country. Anybody who says they have to import salt is wrong, as well. The only mine I have in my area is a salt mine.

In my riding, the loveliest in the world, there is a rabbit producer who has to drive 12 hours in his truck to have his rabbits slaughtered. When they get there, they are stressed out and their fur is standing on end. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477493">Does the minister think it makes sense to have to drive that many kilometres to slaughter rabbits when $50 million has been promised to renovate, refurbish and build new Colbexes?

              <ParaText id="1477496">I am not sure of the issue the member is talking about with respect to rabbits having to travel 12 hours. Is this to get to a federally inspected plant as opposed to a provincial plant, so that they can be exported? Certainly that is a factor. The market will drive that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477497">If there is a demand for rabbit, the program that we have will allow the provincially inspected plant to upgrade to a federal plant. It can make an application under the slaughter-capacity program that we are just bringing out.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477524">Mr. Chair, it is a pleasure to be here tonight and to speak about agriculture and the main estimates. Being a farmer myself, it gives me I think maybe a different meaning than for some. Not all of us can be in agriculture but I am very proud of my background. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477525">I will concentrate my comments tonight mainly on the subject of country of origin labelling. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477526">Farming is the backbone of the Canadian economy and it is by far the most important industry in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="128636" Type="2">Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound</Affiliation>. Knowing this, I am very pleased that the government, our <Affiliation DbId="111568" Type="96">Minister of Agriculture</Affiliation> and all us have worked hard to try to put farmers first when developing agriculture policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477527">Agriculture is a very progressive, innovative and, in most recent years, a very competitive industry. This industry has billions of dollars in sales. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477528">As hon. members know, country of origin labelling, or COOL as it is commonly known, is impacting a number of sectors across the agriculture industry. We have already seen that it caused a plummet in weanling prices for our hog producers last year due to the uncertainty and fear among U.S. buyers. The impact is particularly hard on the livestock industry as it adds new costs into the system in segregation, handling and other requirements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477529">I know from talking to the cattle, hog and lamb producers in my riding, and some from across the country as well, that they have gone through a great deal of hardship in the past seven years. Producers are still feeling the effects of BSE, global red meat prices have slumped continually and they have experienced droughts and flooding in many regions of the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477530">On top of what producers have called the perfect storm for the beef industry, the advent of COOL has been like the U.S. throwing salt in the already open wounds in our red meat sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477531">In a number of sectors, including red meat, we are witnessing what has been called a thickening of the Canada-U.S. border. We have been working very hard with the industry to try to reduce the impact of this and we have had some good progress on a number of fronts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477532">In November 2007 the U.S. border opened to our older cattle and beef from older animals, with the introduction of the BSE second rule. This has given our producers a bigger share of the market. Since then, we have taken action to ensure that the border remains open by participating in U.S. litigation to support the rule. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477533">We have also worked with the Mexican secretary of agriculture to get the Mexican border reopened to Canadian cattle, plus access for breeding animals and dairy replacement heifers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477534">We worked with the CFIA and industry to head off the enhanced testing that was put in place south of the border following the U.S. E. coli recalls.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477535">On COOL more specifically, the United States implementation of country of origin labelling has been a huge concern to this government and our producers since it was first proposed. That is why we did not hesitate to let our southern neighbours know that we would vigorously oppose these measures. We will continue to assess the impact of COOL as it moves along. We hold it in abeyance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477536">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> raised the issue with President George Bush and Canadian ministers have raised it with their U.S. counterparts. We have now raised it with the current President Obama and Secretary Vilsack. We have advanced the pace of the WTO challenge. We have been very clear with the Americans that we will have to undertake this if they proceed down this road.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477537">We have let the Americans know that we will use all the trade dispute mechanisms at our disposal to ensure Canada is treated fairly and retains access without unreasonable regulatory barriers for our producers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477538">Our <Affiliation DbId="128690" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation> also made it clear when he said in a statement that “We believe that the country of origin legislation is creating undue trade restrictions to the detriment of Canadian exporters”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477539">As I said earlier, the livestock sector is a highly integrated industry in North America. Last year almost $4 billion in livestock, beef and pork crossed our borders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477540">Producers and processors on both sides depend on the free flow of goods. That is why last December this government initiated formal consultations with the U.S., under the WTO dispute settlement process, regarding mandatory COOL.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477541"> Canada expects the U.S. to live up to its international trade obligations. COOL threatens to disrupt that flow by adding needless costs and red tape into the system on both sides of the border. COOL will hurt the competitiveness of the integrated North American packing industries. It will drive down prices for Canadian livestock producers, which will eventually hurt the prices American ranchers receive as well.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="10">(2110)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1477542">There really is not a Canadian, or American or Mexican market. It is a completely integrated North American market. In this integrated cattle herd, individual animals sometimes cross borders numerous times for feeding before going to slaughter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477543">Breeding bulls and heifers have been sold between the two countries for over a century. There is no legitimate rationale for COOL to be applied to live cattle slaughtered in the United States. Whether the cattle are born and raised in the U.S. or Canada, they have been subjected to similar regulatory regimes, farming practices and they share the same lineage. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477544">It is clear that COOL is only about discriminatory trade protection for a select few producers in the U.S. COOL is damaging to U.S. feedlots, backgrounders and packing plants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477545">Free and fair trade is essential to the economic health of livestock industries on both sides of the borders. We have been standing up for Canadian producers since the spectre of COOL first surfaced. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477546">The hon. <Affiliation DbId="111560" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food</Affiliation> has been very engaged in this issue, both before and after the new U.S. administration took office. The <Affiliation DbId="128690" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation>, as I mentioned earlier, has constantly raised this issue in his conversations with his American counterparts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477547">Throughout this situation, we have maintained a respectful relationship with our American neighbours, but make no mistake, we mean what we say.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477548">We have consistently made it clear that current COOL regulations unfairly disadvantage Canadian producers. Until we receive the result that is fair for Canada, we will continue, and we must continue, to stand up for Canadian producers against COOL.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477549">The current COOL regulations add huge costs and red tape for Canadian cattle and hog exports heading south. We must continue to restate that point strongly and respectfully, as we work with our American counterparts dealing with the COOL issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477550">I want to talk a little about R-CALF. As I said, we have been trying to stand up for producers, we are standing up producers and defending our sector against the court challenges from R-CALF. In July 2005 my good friend and my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128677" Type="2">Selkirk—Interlake</Affiliation>, as opposition members at the time, and we were opposition members, were the only elected members of this Canadian Parliament to attend the U.S. 9th circuit court of appeals in Seattle, Washington to show our support for the fight against R-CALF, something of which the member for <Affiliation DbId="128677" Type="2">Selkirk—Interlake</Affiliation> and myself are very proud.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477551">The government must continue its work to restore access to markets and opening new ones. Over the past few months, we have re-opened beef access in Hong Kong, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. We are keeping up the pressure with trade missions to Morocco and other countries. These are all good signs of progress, but there is still a lot of work to be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477552">The government plans to pursue commercially significant access to beef markets as a first step in achieving full access, mandating by the World Organization for Animal Health. We are also working hard to diversify our global business through an ambitious agenda for the negotiation of bilateral free trade agreements, and I will use Peru and Colombia as examples there. EFTA is one that has recently come through the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477553">We are working hard to resume trade access in cattle and beef with China. Competitiveness is about trade and it is about innovation at home as well. That is why we support the efforts of the beef and pork value chain round tables. That is why we are working with industry to help it build a strong, positive Canada brand. Let buyers know that no matter what product they choose, if it is Canadian, it comes backed by a commitment to quality and a world-class regulatory system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477554">That is why we are investing in research into beef and pork quality at a research station in Lacombe. That is why we invested $130 million in federal-provincial dollars to help the sector adjust to the enhanced feed ban. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477555">There are still challenges and we are trying to work through them. There is a great opportunity for this sector. The global demand for protein is growing. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477566">Mr. Chair, these are political issues and they have to be. A lot of people are concerned with the future of agriculture. There is no doubt that it is in good hands with this government in play.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477567">The member talked a lot about free trade, but it also has to be fair trade. We are here to ensure that country of origin labelling is fair and does not negatively affect our producers, which we are scared it will.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477568">The problem is the frustration of the unknown. We were able to work with the former administration to get the rules changed to combine two labels and make that much more palatable for the Canadian industry. Since that time, the new administration has decided to go a bit further voluntarily, but said that after six months if we did not measure up to this, it would make it mandatory.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477569">That is where the concern is. That is why we have launched the second challenge, just to address that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477570">The member mentioned our colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128677" Type="2">Selkirk—Interlake</Affiliation>, who is a tireless crusader for the livestock sector. He was a cow-calf operator and so on. He has had some tough times lately. His wife was back in for another operation. Fortunately the tumour was benign, and she is at home recovering. I want to wish them all the best as they move forward. I know everybody agrees with that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477571">There is a tremendous demand around the country for Canadian product. The member opposite also talked about some of the trials and tribulations we faced due to the system in the U.S. with our calf. As opposition, we sought intervener status in that situation. We were granted status, and we were down there to make the points we needed to make.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477572">We are making changes, too, as we move forward to financing for young farmers. There has not been any substantive programming out there. Farm Credit Canada, a division of Agriculture Canada and an arm's-length crown corporation, has a package that is quite good and works well, but it does do not have the depth that is needed. It is looking at doing more and more. I have had those discussions with Greg Stewart.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477573">We are in the process of making changes to the old Farm Improvement and Marketing Cooperatives Loans Act . The name is new and the programming is new. About $1 billion over the next few years will be available to new and beginning farmers. It has never been there before.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477574">We have cut the down payment to 10% from 20%. We have expanded the loan values from $250,000 cap to $500,000, which will help with succession planning. The member also rightly points out that we have changed the capital gains allowance so that dad can take a larger capital gains exemption, sell out to the son, or daughter, or son-in-law or daughter-in-law and he or she can make use of the new money that is available under FIMCLA .</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477575">It is a good all around program. It is the type of thing we see to backstop the future of farming. Agriculture, like any business, is a cash flow business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477576">Mr. Chair, you know that. You have had boots on the ground and farms in your area as do we. Farmers will tell us that they need is access to credit. They are quite happy to take on debt. It has to be good debt. We have done that with them with cash advances, where the first $100,000 is interest free.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477577">Farming is in great shape in our great country. Under our guidance and working with them, we will continue to build a stronger agricultural sector.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477652">Regardless of where we are in this House, a tragedy happened and, in all fairness, our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and friends of those who have been affected by that outbreak.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477653">In terms of the listeria, it is important to understand that the Canadian food safety system is a multi-faceted system, extending over several government departments and agencies and through provincial and municipal governments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477654">No single arm of government acts alone in situations like the listeriosis outbreak we experienced last summer. An effective response requires first-class systems, flawless collaboration and communication between various agencies and across jurisdictions. Certainly the listeriosis outbreak of 2008 informed the government that it needed to strengthen its policies and its activities around the issues of listeria in food and the health risks it poses to Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477655">There were also lessons to be learned about providing a tightly integrated response when several organizations at different levels of government need to coordinate with each other.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477656">I will give a brief timeline of the events of last summer related to this outbreak. I will follow that by letting members know what the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, which I will refer to as CFIA, and its government partners have done since to strengthen our food safety system with regard to listeria.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477657">When the outbreak was identified by the Public Health Agency of Canada last summer, CFIA worked closely with the agency, Health Canada, provincial authorities, local units of public health and the private sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477658">CFIA was first apprised of the situation on August 6, 2008. It was only then that the Toronto Public Health Unit informed the CFIA of two listeriosis illness cases at a Toronto nursing home. It also had preliminary lab results indicating listeria present in the food that had been served at that same location.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477659">From that point onward, CFIA's Office of Food Safety and Recall led around-the-clock food safety investigations to see if there was a link between the listeriosis illness in Toronto and any commercially distributed food.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477660">During the food safety investigation, CFIA worked with its partners at the federal, provincial and public health unit levels, collecting evidence that allowed them to make the link between the contaminated food and the listeriosis illness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477661">Early on August 17, 2008, based on information and guidance provided by CFIA, Maple Leaf Foods started to a recall on ready-to-eat meat products produced at that plant. Additional food safety investigations resulted in an expanded voluntary recall of other products from the very same plant. The recall for this outbreak represents one of the largest in recent Canadian history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477662">In addition to its magnitude, the recall was complex, requiring an extensive effort with respect to product traceability and coordination with government partners and industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477663">The process involved included: a sampling blitz, with some 348 sample units being tests; 192 Maple Leaf products recalled; and approximately 30,000 recall effectiveness checks completed nationwide. I think that in itself indicates the complexity of what a recall involves. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="40">(2140)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1477664">CFIA conducted operational reviews after the listeriosis outbreak of 2008. Many aspects of the agency's response were reviewed, including how it communicated and coordinated internally. It also analyzed its collaboration with federal partners, other levels of government and industry. It reviewed how it engaged with the Canadian public and the industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477665">Beyond communication and coordination, the agency also reviewed its activities at the Maple Leaf plant at Bartor Road. It reviewed inspection records and actions prior to the outbreak and its subsequent investigative activities there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477666">As the House may be aware, both CFIA and Maple Leaf investigations pinpointed biological material deep inside the slicers at plant 97B as breeding grounds for listeria as the root cause for the outbreak. As soon as this was confirmed, CFIA immediately gave directives to industry for new deep sanitizing procedures for slicers and has subsequently introduced mandatory environmental testing for listeria.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477667">What many Canadians might not know is that Canada used to have a mandatory environmental testing regime prior to 2005. In that year, when the member for <Affiliation DbId="128358" Type="2">Malpeque</Affiliation> was parliamentary secretary to the minister of agriculture and the member for <Affiliation DbId="128311" Type="2">St. Paul's</Affiliation> was the minister of state for the Public Health Agency of Canada in the last government, environmental testing was cut. It was simply put to an end. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477668">We learned from Michael McCain last month at the subcommittee that despite the Liberal government's cancellation of mandatory environmental testing for listeria, Maple Leaf was taking voluntary tests. Mr. McCain testified that Maple Leaf had some positive listeria tests results beginning in May 2008, leading up to the outbreak in August of 2008.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477669">Under the law then there was no legal obligation to report these results to CFIA. It simply filed the results away in a binder. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477670">I want to read what Dr. Brian Evans, Canada's chief veterinary officer, told our subcommittee on listeria what this resulted in. In his opening remarks about environmental testing, he said:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477679">We agree with the member in his presentation that when this began we were looking for a needle in a haystack. My congratulations go out to the CFIA teams and the public health teams, both federally and provincially, that did yeoman service throughout that stressful time and continue to seek a better way to do this. We have analyzed and found the root cause but no one can guarantee that this will never happen again. We are hopeful that we can limit it, that we can get on top of it quicker and that there will never be this severe an impact. We are pledged to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477680">This really tested the mettle of the complete Canadian system. What this brought to the forefront and what we learned, which has already been applied with H1N1, is far better communication and coordination among everyone involved. I think we have seen that borne out as we came to grips with H1N1. It continues to unfold and that compatibility of programming and so on is being redesigned and redeveloped.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477681">To that end, we as a federal government have reinvigorated our efforts under both product and health, in both Health Canada and the CFIA, to reinvigorate the number of inspectors and the volumes of money that will be allocated in budgets. We look forward to a compilation of the lessons learned reports that we have already seen, plus the independent investigation led by Sheila Weatherall. It will give us a better indication of gaps that we may have missed to this point that we can again address by human and budgetary resources. We certainly pledge to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477682">We are quite excited by the tremendous work done by Sheila Weatherall. She has the capacity, knowledge and tools at her disposal to come forward with a great report.

There has been some discussion over her selection, particularly by members of the opposition party who tried to discredit her credibility and the work she is doing.

              <ParaText id="1477687">Mr. Chair, I noticed the minister's comments earlier about Alberta sugar perhaps going somewhere to help with the peaches. I would ask him two questions around labelling and peaches. Sugar is needed in canning clingstone peaches. The problem of course with the clingstone peaches is we do not have a canner because the last canner east of the Rocky Mountains closed a little over a year ago. Consequently those peach growers in the Niagara region do not need sugar because they do not have a canner. So it really does not matter whether sugar was going to take the labelling beyond the 95% to 98% when it would not be called a product of Canada. We just do not can peaches in this country because there is nowhere to can them. If they get canned it will be in the United States and clearly that will not be a product of Canada as it comes back through. That becomes problematic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477688">Do we see any programs coming down to restore the cannery and restore canneries east of the Rocky Mountains again, so indeed tender fruit croppers can eventually stay in business? They are going to go out of business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477689">The other part to that question is about labelling. In the wine industry we have two products in the Niagara Peninsula. One is called cellared in Canada and one is called VQA. The VQA is the vintner's quality alliance, while cellared in Canada for most consumers assumes that it is made here, but that is the furthest thing from the truth. We have products that cannot say product of Canada, when indeed they have only a marginal amount of foreign content, and we have a product cellared in Canada that basically is wholly produced elsewhere. The juice that comes in from Chile, Argentina and Australia is put in a bottle and it is labelled as cellared in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477690">Could the minister address those two issues?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477691">Mr. Chair, certainly we are concerned when a processor moves out of the country too because it takes away from a top quality Canadian product. We have programs that are available to re-stimulate that should producers decide they want to do that. With the changes that we have made under, and I will still call it FIMCLA because that is what it is, we do not have that bill passed yet, under that program and the new version of that under the cooperative side, producers can go together. They can borrow up to $3 million backed by the federal government with 51% producer control. They have to be in the driver's chair. Forty-nine per cent could then be added to by outside investors and so on, the community and whatever, to reignite that peach factory. That is a great opportunity to do that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477692">Having said that, we are also looking at agri-flex. There are positions in that when we talk about innovation, value added processing that we can work with producers to re-stimulate that type of a market. I am quite excited by that. The member opposite is right to point out that we need to retain those types of situations in Canada and get them back working here with Canadian jobs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477693">When it comes to the wine, that is a situation we are working on with the Canadian Vintners Association. Norm Beal is the president. We have had a couple of meetings so far. We are talking about that. We are working along those lines. I agree that consumers have the right and the need to know where that product comes from.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477694">Mr. Chair, we would like to see the cannery. The building still exists and perhaps we can see that fired up again for the Niagara producers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477695">Let us move on to something else. Last year Mr. Paul Mayers, the acting VP for programs at CFIA told reporters on August 28 that 175 new meat inspectors were hired from March 2006 to March 2008. The day before at a press conference to discuss the listeriosis outbreak, the minister himself said, “there have been some 200 inspectors added to the lines of CFIA over the past two years of this government and we have another 58 that we brought on board before the end of this fiscal year”. That was on August 27, 2008. A few months later the minister said, “Between March 2006 and March 2008 we hired 200 food safety inspection personnel and an additional 87 food safety personnel have been added in the past year”. That statement was made on February 28, 2009 to the subcommittee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477696">What I have a problem with is the numbers. They do not add up. Initially the CFIA vice president said 175, the minister said 200 and then said there were another 58, then later on he went on to say there were 200 and then there were 87. The problem is in the subcommittee when I asked the vice-president, Mr. Cameron, could he give me the number, he could not. When I asked if he would send me the number, he said he would and of course we still have not received the number.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477697">It seems to me the numbers have bounced all over the place and somebody really has a tough time with arithmetic because no one can actually add them up and make them come out to what they truly are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477698">I wonder if the minister can actually clarify all of these numbers and tell me how many meat inspectors, not inspectors, but meat inspectors were actually hired and put on the front line from 2006 to the present day?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477700">I can assure the member that the global number of CFIA employees and front-line inspectors has gone up by some 14% under our tutelage, and we continue to add to that number. The budgets are there to do that. Of course we want qualified people. This is not something that people are hired off the street to do. We continually head hunt for those people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477701">We are in the neighbourhood of 3,228 inspectors. I have seen numbers that roughly half of those are involved in meat, but of course that number expands and contracts as plants change. We have the unfortunate situation where a plant in Saskatchewan right now has closed its doors for a short time, XL meat processors in Saskatchewan. Right now a number of inspectors have been transferred to other facilities. That number is in flux at all times.</ParaText>

In most industries I have ever been involved with there is always an ability to head count. The problem the CFIA has when it comes to its meat inspection system is that the CFIA cannot quantify it. Yet we are supposed to trust it with the safety of our food products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477703">The other evening the Canadian Meat Council suggested that “CFIA inspectors need to have regular consistent training”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477704">The Canadian Meat Council said, “It was evident to us after the new listeriosis control policy was implemented on April 1, 2009 that many inspectors didn't know enough about proper aseptic sampling techniques”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477705">We heard about that in the paper, and I believe the CFIA discontinued doing it for a period of time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477706">Will we provide the resources to enable the CFIA to make sure that the testing procedures that it needs to complete get done? If it indeed involves overtime, are we willing to pay it to get it done? Has it been completed as of now?</ParaText>

As we know, in less than 40 days the Competition Bureau actually approved the sale of the Tyson beef packing plant to XL. Now that XL has closed, the only major beef packing plant between Toronto and central Alberta reminds me of the cannery in St. Davids that closed, the last one east of the Rockies.

CCA's CanFax also said of the closure, “We're reducing capacity and the plants don't have to go out there and be quite as aggressive on their bids to procure cattle”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477715">The question really is, did we know this? Did we know that the Tyson-XL sale would lead to less aggressive bidding and lower cattle prices?

              <ParaText id="1477782">I have a number of other questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477783">We have determined thus far that the minister seems willing to leave hog producers to the ravages of an unbalanced marketplace; in other words, let them go broke. He has basically said here tonight that he is not going to consider ad hoc funding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477784">In answering the question with respect to the <Affiliation DbId="128634" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s commitment of $100 million per year for cost of production, the minister confirmed that there has been no money paid out under that program. Therefore, the <Affiliation DbId="128634" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation> obviously broke his word.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477785">He has confirmed that the government broke its election promise on AgriFlexibility, which was $500 million over five years. It has now promised $400 million over five years, but it is really only $190 million in new money, and it is not allowing it to be used flexibly for the risk management program in Ontario, or ASRA in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477786">He confirmed that the $12.4 million announced for the P.E.I. crop loss damage was only partially paid out and that the $6 million committed to the Atlantic beef plant was not delivered. That is another broken promise. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477787">With regard to the hogs and beef market, the minister is looking at new markets, and I have congratulated him for that. However, the most important market is the market we have. Do not lose it. What is the minister doing to try to keep the market we have in the United States? That is our most important market. When we lose it, it is gone. All the others will not make up for it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477789">Certainly in our new suite of programs we are working to address cost of production, which made the straight cost of production program redundant. We even had the program in place last year, yet nobody could trigger it. It was not triggerable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477790">The last statistics I saw showed that Ontario only triggered $2 million last year. If we did not want to send any money to farmers and we did not want to make farmers profitable, that is where I would park the money. We will not do that. We will make sure they get programs that will trigger and build a stronger market for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477791">I can assure the hon. member that AgriInsurance has already paid out $15 million to potato producers on P.E.I. AgriRecovery is paying out another $1.4 million. We also have another program with the province that will trigger when potatoes are left in the field, which we asked them to do. It will pay out on potatoes that were put in storage and for the cleaning of those storage facilities. We are working on how we flow the full amount of money to the province. We fully intend to do that. We do not make false promises. We follow through.</ParaText>

The fact of the matter is that AgriRecovery money, which was supposed to be a disaster program, only covers the costs of getting rid of the product, whether they disc it down or get it out of the warehouse. That does not deal with the crop loss damage cost, which is loss of income to the tune of $2,800 per acre. Those are the facts.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477797">Mr. Chair, despite some of the partisan bluster that goes on in the House from time to time, I would like to start my speech tonight by reiterating the minister's comments about our former agriculture chair, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128677" Type="2">Selkirk—Interlake</Affiliation>, who is at home with his wife after surgery.

              <ParaText id="1477799"> It has been real honour to serve on the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food for the last couple of years. Some of the finest people are on this committee, from the chairman and the parliamentary secretary to the committee members who showed their devotion to show up for countless hours of subcommittee and main committee, all trying to work for a better future for our farmers, both young and old.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477800">That leads me to the discussion I would like to have tonight on an important issue that has become increasingly crucial to my constituents regarding honesty in product labelling and the criteria that must be met for an item to be given the product of Canada designation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477801">Product labelling affects the ability to market and sell most goods produced by farmers in all regions of Canada. I was proud to take the time to listen to hours of testimony and participate in debate last spring and fall listening to Canadians who were calling for immediate changes to the product of Canada labelling regulations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477802">Thankfully, on May 21, 2008, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister </Affiliation> unveiled the new food labelling initiative together with the <Affiliation DbId="111560" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.</Affiliation> In conjunction, they also launched the Canadian food and consumers safety action plan, which was committed to reviewing the policy on the use of product of Canada and made in Canada labelling claims on food labels and in advertising.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477803">These substantial changes to labelling will have a direct effect on the industry and, consequently, they sat down with many stakeholders and community groups who were affected by the proposed changes, to learn how they feel that will personally affect them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477804">Consumer groups, food processors and retailers, as well as farmers, have been consulted. Over 1,500 people completed an online survey about labelling legislation and many more called or wrote in to make sure their views were heard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477805">Overwhelmingly, the response was the same. Canadian stakeholders wanted and needed new labelling so that they know consumers can clearly and confidently identify their product as made in Canada or product of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477806">In order to understand how important these changes are, one must take a look at the regulations before they were changed by the minister. They had nothing to do with food content and everything to do with the pricing formula, ensuring merely that 51% of the total content was produced or packaged in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477807">During our consultations as a committee, however, time and time again industry and, in particular, Canadians consumers called this not only misleading, but borderline fraudulent. Consumer confidence is increased when they know they can count on the product to be Canadian made, locally grown and processed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477808">Many stakeholder groups that were consulted believed this would promote uniquely Canadian foods and build on the consumer desire to buy locally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477809">The policy on voluntary product of Canada claims on food products and advertising came into effect December 31, 2008. These specified that manufacturers would only be allowed to use product of Canada labels if all or virtually all of the contents were Canadian. The made in Canada label may be used if a food product is manufactured or processed in Canada, regardless of where the contents are from.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477810">There are several different approaches to labelling product to help farmers and producers get their made in Canada message across without using those two terms but that still communicates to consumers their local Canadian base. A food product may claim the product of Canada term when all or virtually all major ingredients, processing and labour used to make the food product are from Canada. This means that all significant ingredients must be Canadian and non-Canadian material must be negligible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477811">This is what consumers and our producers were asking for. Ingredients that are present in a food at very low levels that are not generally produced in Canada, including spices, food additives and vitamins, may be used without disqualifying the food from making a product of Canada claim. Generally, the percentage referred to is very little or minor and is considered to be 2% or less.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="25">(2225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1477812">The former food labelling guidelines had not been changed since the 1980s and we owe Canadians the best regulations possible. As the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister Harper</Affiliation> said, “Our new guidelines are designed to redefine Canadian food content labels to better reflect the true origins of products in today's global marketplace”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477813">Our government is tightening the definitions of these familiar labels so Canadians know exactly what they are getting and get exactly what they want.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477814">The consumer support for this initiative has been overwhelming. </ParaText>

I had the great opportunity to do that for a number of years and ended up chairing it over a couple of seasons. We worked very well and the member for <Affiliation DbId="128358" Type="2">Malpeque</Affiliation> is giving me a compliment. I want that circled on the agenda because it just does not happen often.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477818">When it comes to product of Canada, we were after a situation where the consumers were served in their best interests and also it helped Canadian producers to showcase their top quality products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477819">We started with a consultation phase over some months that saw some 1,500 interventions. Over 90% of them recommended the 98%. We built a very fulsome program that has been embraced by the vast majority of Canadian consumers and by the vast majority of Canadian processors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477820">They are struggling to come to that standard in a number of different ways. As I said earlier to some of the other interventions, we are seeing some great work done with 100% Canadian potatoes and then listing the other ingredients as well, but it lets people know that the base is 100% Canadian. I think that is an excellent opportunity to showcase all those different situations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477821">A 98% product of Canada is the ultimate marketing tool. It tells consumers that there is no concern. Everything is Canadian and it lives up to those very high standards that we enforce.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477822">If we were to drop to lower standards, it would allow for the perversions that we used to see under the old rules where it was based on cost and not content.

I am not sure they understand the program itself. This is an issue with the OUI program that I have been working on for a couple of years trying to ensure that six million litres of product that is used through the own use import program by Saskatchewan and Alberta farmers, giving them a direct savings to their input costs, has been able to be continued.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477825">I know that the minister was personally responsible for helping to keep that program alive until we got the GROU program up and running and a little bit more productive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477826">I would like an update from the minister on the grow program and I have a couple of questions for him. I would like to know how many pesticides are now eligible. When we first started this program there were many problems and could only get one or two pesticides through. How many pesticides can our producers now use?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477827">I would also like to know what the minister is doing to decrease the time it takes to register a pesticide, as well as adding new pesticides. Is he still continuing to move toward adding new pesticides to the program for our producers?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477828"> Mr. Chair, as our producers struggle with rising input costs, it is very beneficial to them to have access to other lines of product. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477829">We saw the great work done to get generic glyphosate. As he said, several millions of litres that go through predominantly Saskatchewan and Alberta for the crops that we grow there have been a boon to those farmers. We have a few more of those registered now. Glyphosate was the only one registered under the OUI. Under the new growing forward there have been some 186 regulatory submissions. The list is getting shorter. We have 151 projects under way. We are now working in conjunction with some of our trading partners taking their science and adding to ours rather than starting at zero all the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477830">We also, through the growing forward network of programming last year, funded some 30 different chemicals and pesticides and did a double flow with PMRA to speed up that regulatory registration process so that producers could have access to those new cost effective tools and better environmentally impacted tools that we can give them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477831">Under the new grow program, as the member said, it is grower requested. Therefore, we work through the system what producers want. That helps in keeping the queue down that we are working on the priorities for producers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477833">We have had a history of this in our agriculture committee over the last couple of years. When it came to product of Canada labelling, on May 21 the member for <Affiliation DbId="128358" Type="2">Malpeque</Affiliation> was putting his own press releases out and taking credit for it. Now he is in committee attacking it. It is tough to get where he is at on these issues. However, I understood that the official opposition was in favour of Bill <Document DbId="3850776" Type="3">C-29</Document>, the farm improvement and marketing cooperatives loans act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477834">This is a very important piece of legislation to my farmers. It would give them access to the credit they need to be able to grow, to expand and sometimes just survive these troubling times. Even during the week, I thought we had unanimous consent to move this legislation forward quickly. Today in committee, when the government side requested to put forward a report that the Canadian Wheat Board admits it has and supposedly has no problem tabling with the public, the official opposition, led by the member for <Affiliation DbId="128358" Type="2">Malpeque</Affiliation>, stalled, stammered and at the end of the day just walked out of the room on us, not allowing us to move forward with the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477835">In fact, at one point he even threatened to delay our legislation until late next spring simply because his ego was bruised that we might ask for a report tabled to be made public on the Canadian Wheat Board's loss of over $300 million of western Canadian money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477836">Could the minister tell the House what the Liberals have to hide when it comes to the Canadian Wheat Board?

              <ParaText id="1477838">However, I am sure cooler heads will prevail. As I said in my opening statements, everyone here has the best interests of farmers at heart. We may disagree on how we deliver those programs but at the end of the day we all know it needs to be done. The changes to the FIMCLA and bringing it up to date are very important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477839">Agriculture is a capital-intensive business. We all recognize the fact that most farmers out there are approaching retirement age and are looking to move their enterprise on to a son, daughter, daughter-in-law, son-in-law or a neighbour for that matter but they need access to credit to do that. The new proposal is all about modernizing that particular act to trigger roughly another billion dollars over the next few years so that beginning farmers can actually have a chance to take over dad's farm like I was able to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477840">My son will not have that opportunity because of the changes that I have made in my life. He has gone on to work in the oil patch. This is such a capital-intensive business that he will not get his opportunity. We are saddened by that because he would have been the fifth generation farming and that would have been fantastic to see. However, we have gotten beyond that but we are here to help other people to have those opportunities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477841">I am quite excited by the changes that we have made. Beginning farmers will have access to some $500,000, which is double what they used to have, with a 10% down payment rather than 20%. That loan, being backstopped by the federal government, will be at a preferred rate. We will ensure that the banks, credit unions and so on acknowledge that and work fairly with farmers when it comes to those loans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477842">I am quite excited by it and I think the members opposite will come to grips with that too. We did have an example earlier about moneys going into a cooperative type of situation. I think it is time to reinvent that so we can get on top of some of these input costs and so on.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477843">Mr. Chair, my thanks to all our colleagues for coming together this evening to take part in the debate in committee of the whole with the <Affiliation DbId="111560" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food</Affiliation>. I thank him also for his presence, and for taking part in this extremely important exercise. I hope that when I have finished all my questions I will still be in a good mood. I also hope that the answers he will give me will be satisfactory to the potato growers in my region, who have been waiting a long time for answers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477844">When the Canadian Food Inspection Agency came to their farms during the summer and fall of 2006, they were told to be cooperative and to work with the agency. They were told not to be apprehensive, because the agency was there to help them. They had hopes of a solution, despite the fact that on October 12, 2006, the area surrounding Saint-Amable was declared a regulated zone. They knew this had to be done and they accepted it gracefully, because they were well aware that the border needed to be reopened. They were wholehearted in their solidarity with all the other growers so that trade could continue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477845">Nevertheless, they suffered some setbacks, since things were not resolved right away. However, on November 22, 2006, the parliamentary secretary to the previous minister said that the problem facing the producers in Saint-Amable would be resolved. A year later, I had to raise the issue again. Once again, I had to ask questions. That time, the Secretary of State (Agriculture), who is now the <Affiliation DbId="125159" Type="4">Minister of Public Works and Government Services</Affiliation>, told us, “Things are going well with the producers. We are talking and a plan is being implemented as we speak.” That was October 26, 2007. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477846">The situation is still unresolved today. Potato producers in Saint-Amable are still wondering if anyone on the other side of the House is listening to them and if the government is going to do something. Since they are watching us on television at this time, I hope they will be able to hear the minister's answers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477847">The situation was not resolved and an election was called. The hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128163" Type="2">Mégantic—L'Érable</Affiliation> said that it would be discussed among the ministers and that a resolution was not far off. We were told not to worry, that it would come. Once again, nothing happened. At the end of April, that is, a few days ago, when the minister announced his new agricultural policy in Sainte-Croix de Lotbinière, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128366" Type="2">Jonquière—Alma</Affiliation>, who is also the <Affiliation DbId="128684" Type="4">Minister of State (Agriculture)</Affiliation>, said that something would now be done. He said that by the end of May an agreement would be presented that would meet the producers' expectations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477848">I have a question for the minister. Will the producers really see a satisfactory agreement by the end of May?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477849">There is a little background on that situation, Mr. Chair. There are 21 affected farmers in the member's riding. To date, they have received some $8 million of government program spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477850">As he has alluded to, another package is being worked on right now. I know the date that was agreed on by the provincial minister, my counterpart, and the industry is the end of May. I certainly intend to honour that date. We will work with the producers that are affected. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477851">We are also looking at the opportunity or the possibility to use the new agricultural flexibility program to develop a pilot, as the farms are small by western standards, 60 acres roughly on average, to build economies of scale to move into some product base that will actually work for them. Corn is not going to do it. We understand that. Soy is not going to give them the return they need off of those small acres. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477852">Is there something we can do to bring them together in a co-operative way, such as forming a pilot project? Is there something we can do that will take it through to a finished product that will bring them back into the farm sector on that ground? We are happy to work with them and continue those discussions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477853">Mr. Chair, this answer is a step in the right direction. However, I will ask the minister a more specific question. His first offer to farmers was rather modest. There was $5 million for the long-term recovery plan over a three-year period. As the minister himself mentioned, the acreage is small and not suitable for extensive corn production. The soil will also remain contaminated for a number of years because the golden nematode does not just disappear but remains dormant in the soil for several decades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477854">We will have to review the issue of markets. New crops cannot be planted until good market studies have been conducted and without a certain amount of market preparation or without knowing all the other players and creating a niche. It becomes rather complicated. There is also the matter of reputation. The minister is certainly aware that, since the arrival of the golden nematode, the municipality of Saint-Amable, the farmers, nursery workers and horticulturalists of that area have been subject to prejudice. The situation requires a complete repositioning. The warehouses and machinery were suited to the production of potatoes. If they have to change crops, they will need a transition program over a longer period of time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477855">The minister ordered an independent study that set the transition period at 10 years. It established the amounts required for the complete restructuring of the regional agricultural economy at about $30 million or $31 million. The farmers are prepared to provide up to 20% of that amount.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1477856">I would like the minister to tell us if the new offer will respect these parameters, which prevent the use of existing standardized programs. The farmers of Saint-Amable are in an extraordinary situation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1477857">Mr. Chair, the government understands the situation. The key point in what the hon. member has said and what I have spoken about is whether it will this be satisfactory. Somehow I doubt any amount ever would be.
