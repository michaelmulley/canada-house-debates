            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1270987">Mr. Speaker, as my party's industry, science and technology critic, it is my honour to say a few words about Bill <Document DbId="3628831" Type="3">C-4, An Act respecting not-for-profit corporations and certain other corporations</Document>. This bill, you will remember, originated with the Liberal Party almost a decade ago in order to review the regulations and the governance rules of not-for-profit organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1270988">As we know, this bill specifically concerns not-for-profit organizations; it would replace part II of the Canada Corporations Act and it would apply to some entities currently covered by part III of that act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1270989">The bill would also provide for continuance of companies that were created by special acts of Parliament and subject to part IV of the Canada Corporations Act and, finally, it would repeal the Canada Corporations Act.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="05">(1005)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1270990">Bill <Document DbId="3628831" Type="3">C-4</Document> was developed as a result of the previous Liberal government's commitment to the voluntary sector task force initiated in 1999 to modernize the governance of the non-profit sector. It proposes substantial changes to regulations going back to 1917.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1270991">Many of the corporate governance provisions, as well as many other provisions found in the bill, are modelled on the corporate governance provisions contained in the Canada Business Corporations Act, the statute that regulates federally incorporated for profit corporations; that is business corporations.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1270992">Generally speaking, this legislation is seeking to provide a framework for the modern corporate governance of some 20,000 federally incorporated not-for-profit organizations that include community, ecological, cultural and religious organizations as well as national charities and many others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1270993">Since July 2000, and then again in March 2002, Industry Canada has shared its consultation reports while organizing new consultations across the country in order to discuss different reform alternatives.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1270994">Following the second round of consultations Industry Canada released a paper entitled “Reform of the Canada Corporations Act: The Federal Not-for-Profit Framework Law”. Two years later the Liberal Party introduced the first version of the non-profit corporations act as Bill C-21. The bill passed second reading, underwent three committee meetings, but did not reach a final vote before the election call in late 2005.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1270995">Under the Conservative government, the bill was reintroduced as Bill C-62 but only passed first reading before being lost in the September 2008 election call. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1270996">Bills <Document DbId="3568474" Type="3">C-62</Document> and <Document DbId="3628831" Type="3">C-4</Document> certainly do contain amendments to Bill <Document DbId="1457967" Type="3">C-21</Document>, as well as the definition of a “soliciting corporation”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1270997">We are all aware that soliciting corporations receive part or all of their funding from public sources, whether by fundraising or other means.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1270998">I should point out that Bill <Document DbId="3628831" Type="3">C-4</Document> is flexible enough to address the needs of not-for-profit organizations of all sizes effectively by introducing clearer rules and both accountability and transparency for the entire not-for-profit sector. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1270999">Overall, the bill introduces significant changes with respect to financial accountability, the rights and responsibilities of directors and officers, and the rights of members.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1271000">If passed, Bill C-4 will implement new rules on financial reporting based on the organization's annual revenue and sources of funding, new rules on standard of care for directors and new rules for direction liability, new rules that permit written resolutions in place of meetings and allow corporations to avail themselves of technological advances, also new rules permitting members access to certain information to monitor director activities and enforce their rights within the organization and a streamlining of the incorporation process and a reduction in the regulatory burden for the not for profit sector.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1271001">In other words, with this new bill, the sometimes endless and often complicated incorporation process will be streamlined and simplified. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271002">Organizations will be able to fill out electronic forms and pay fees on line, and the current requirement that applications for incorporation are subject to a departmental review will be eliminated. This will make the incorporation process easier and faster.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1271003">The new office of director of corporations would replace the current system of ministerial review and discretion. This director would have administrative and regulatory functions and would be able to issue incorporation, amalgamation or dissolution certificates, investigate and make enquiries about compliance and access key corporate documents like membership lists and financial statements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271004">As stated, the new bill would also make significant changes in terms of financial accountability, the rights and responsibilities of directors, officers and members' rights. Improving transparency and accountability is a major objective of the new legislation through new rules on financial review and disclosure. All non-profits will need to make their financial statements available to their members, directors and officers in addition to the director appointed under the act.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1271005">Directors of soliciting organizations will have to make their records available to the public. This legislation will also improve financial accountability with new accounting audit rules. These rules recognize that not-for-profit organizations have different levels of revenue and different funding sources. All soliciting and non-soliciting organizations classified under the new legislation as having “significant” revenue will be subject to an accounting audit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271006">I want to point out that the stakeholders targeted by this new legislation supported the proposed changes during initial consultations, as did the witnesses who testified during the earlier committee meetings. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1271007">Strong support was given for the proposed reforms dealing with standard of care, due diligence defence, indemnification and insurance and limited liability of directors and officers. Some of the areas where there was less unanimity between those consulted included clarification of the rules governing non-for-profit corporations versus registered charities, whether there should be classifications under the bill that would stipulate different requirements based on the type of not-for-profit organization, whether it should be necessary to file bylaws and, finally, the level of auditing required.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1271008">The committee can certainly examine these points in detail. In the meantime, speaking as a person who has been involved in not-for-profit organizations, I must say that I support this legislation wholeheartedly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271009">I want to emphasize that my Liberal colleagues and I are eager to work with our colleagues on the government side to pass this important legislation, which has been a long time coming.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1271011">What are my hon. friend's views on what the government should have done in the budget and what it still can do to maximize investments in research and development?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271012">We know the value added benefits for research and development in our country are enormous to allow us to capitalize on the future needs of our country and the great challenges that face us in the world, not only the environmental challenges but the social challenges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271013"> I would like to know not only what investments should be made, but how they should be made and how we can maximize the interplay between the research and development units and post-secondary institutions and the private sector within our country and between countries.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1271014">Mr. Speaker, it is certain that in this time of economic crisis we must put a great deal of emphasis on the importance of science, research and innovation for the future of our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271015">The Liberal Party, back in the 1990s, under Mr. Chrétien and Mr. Martin, had the foresight to put into place some extremely important programs, such as the Canada Foundation for Innovation, the Canada research chairs, Genome Canada, which we have spoke of lately, and also the very important program to fund the indirect costs of university research. Those programs were far-sighted, at a difficult financial time, I might add, in the mid-1990s, and have been acclaimed by our universities and our research hospitals as providing that necessary support from the federal government to re-invigorate research in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271016">As we have seen in the past week or so, a number of these organizations, such as Genome Canada and, more recent, the three national funding research councils and our scientists have all decried that the programs I just mentioned are not continuing to receive steady support, particularly at this time when it is crucial for us to continue to build on that capability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271017"> I hope and I pray that the government will take note of this and realize that science is something that we must support for the long run. It is not something that we address on an ad hoc basis when we decide it is time to make a small injection to turn on the tap and turn it off. We must realize the importance of steadily supporting scientific research in our country.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1271018">Mr. Speaker, we understand the need for bringing our corporations act into the 21st century. However, we are rather disappointed that a fairly straightforward six page present act has been expanded into a rather bloated a one hundred and seventy page document. We believe there will be need for amendments to the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271019">We are particularly concerned that the bill would increase the record keeping and regulatory burden on non-profits, especially the small non-profits. It seems to treat the average legion social club the same as it treats the Red Cross of Canada. We are concerned that the record keeping requirements will become onerous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271020"> We hope there will be some trimming down and some thought given to that sort of thing. What we seem to have is a 170 page expansion and legalization of <I>Robert's Rules of Order</I>.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1271021">Mr. Speaker, I take note of the member's comments. It is a large document, but the consensus that has been reached in consultations over a period of six to eight years is this is in fact a document that streamlines and clarifies the responsibilities and the processes involved with being a non-profit corporation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271022">However, I take note of the member's comments. It would be important to ensure that small organizations would not burdened to the same extent as larger organizations. I welcome the member's input to the committee discussions that will take place in due course to move toward a ratification of the bill.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1271023">Mr. Speaker, in order to maintain scientists of the calibre that my colleague just mentioned, and others in our country, we have to be able to cultivate them from the very beginning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271024">Senator Lillian Dyck, from the other place, has started, with her friends, a way for children to have access to science and to have it available to them in a fun way. This is extremely important, as we know, to enable children to have exposure to science, for them to be inspired by science, and for them to be interested in science. I hope that for some of them at least they would be able to follow a course of action professionally later on in life that follows one of the sciences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271025">I would like to ask my hon. friend, while this is not in the realm of the federal government, does he not think that the federal government has an enormous opportunity to work with the provincial ministries of education to enable children to have access to science, to implement scientific programs that expose children to science in a fun way? In doing so, we would begin to cultivate that fertile imagination of children and inspire them. We would involve them and include them in the great world of science and the wonderful world of discovery that awaits all of us.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1271027"> In the particular area that I have been involved in my professional life, which is the space business, I have had the opportunity to interact with the provinces during the past 25 years. In their primary and secondary level curriculum, they have included some modules that deal with space and astronomy. There is no question about it, those are areas that stimulate the minds of young people and perhaps in some cases may make them think about science as being a potential career of their own.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271028">I think the federal government can work with provincial jurisdictions to create a more positive scientific culture in our primary and secondary schools for the good of the country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1271029">Mr. Speaker, I should have asked my friend a question regarding astrophysics. Canada is the third leading country in the world in investments in astrophysics. In fact, our country, and this is a great news story, actually punches well above its weight. There are opportunities right now in investments in the large Array telescope that we have and in the post-Hubble telescope to make investments which have huge opportunities and implications for us, not only in astrophysics but in the applied sciences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271030">My friend is an engineer by trade, an electrical engineer if memory serves me correctly. Does he not think that our government should make a concerted effort to support our astronomers and to support astrophysics because we know that the investment in astrophysics results in a 7 to 10 times to 1 investment in the monies that are put in?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271031"> Really, this is a great news story for Canada and Canadians because our astrophysicists punch well above their weight. Canada is the third leading country in the world in our capabilities and discoveries in this important area.</ParaText>

For those who do not know it, our astronomers are the pride of this country in terms of published articles and discoveries. That is something I hope more Canadians will become aware of.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1271034">For several years, a number of representatives of not-for-profit corporations have been pressing to have the Canada Corporations Act modernized. In the past decade, numerous people have taken part in consultations, while others have made written submissions to Industry Canada calling for rapid amendments to the Canada Corporations Act. In recent years, some people have expressed concern that the Canada Corporations Act is out of date and no longer meets the needs of the not-for-profit sector. Stakeholders have publicly called for reform of the act and, in 1999, the task force on the voluntary sector, which was created by the federal government, called for improvements to the regulatory framework governing this sector. Industry Canada's proposal to modernize the Canada Corporations Act forms part of the task force's plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271035">In July 2000, Industry Canada released a consultation paper entitled Reform of the Canada Corporations Act: The Federal Not-for-Profit Framework Law. After releasing this document, the department held a series of round tables in cities across the country to look at the ideas in the document and consider various legislative options. The government then made concrete proposals to reform the not-for-profit corporations legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271036">On November 15, 2004, the Liberal government introduced Bill <Document DbId="1457967" Type="3">C-21</Document>, which never reached second reading. On June 13, 2008, during the second session of the 39th Parliament, the Conservative government introduced Bill <Document DbId="3568474" Type="3">C-62</Document>, which was similar to what the Liberals had tabled. With the hasty election call last September, this bill died on the order paper. On December 3, 2008, a similar bill was introduced for first reading by the <Affiliation DbId="128715" Type="4">Minister of State (Small Business and Tourism)</Affiliation>. Once again, it died on the order paper when Parliament was prorogued on December 4. Finally, the Conservative minister introduced the same legislation on January 28 as Bill <Document DbId="3628831" Type="3">C-4</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271037">Since 2004, both Liberal and Conservative governments introduced various bills that all died on the order paper. In spite of everything, it is quite clear that there is a common desire on both sides of the House to modernize the Canada Corporations Act, especially since the bills introduced by previous governments have all been very similar.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271038">To briefly summarize Bill <Document DbId="3628831" Type="3">C-4</Document>, its primary aim is to propose new legislation on not-for-profit corporations that would establish a more modern and transparent framework for such organizations. The operational framework for not-for-profit corporations would be similar to corporate governance under the Canada Business Corporations Act. The new act would gradually repeal the Canada Corporations Act and would replace parts II, III and IV of that act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271039">According to the minister herself, Bill <Document DbId="3628831" Type="3">C-4</Document> will cut administrative costs facing not-for-profit corporations and will strengthen and clarify the governance rules that apply to these corporations. In more concrete terms, this bill will simplify the incorporation of not-for-profit corporations; clarify the rights and responsibilities of directors; establish defences for directors and officers in the event of liability; provide members with increased rights to contribute to the governance of their corporation; and establish a better mechanism to oversee the corporations' accounts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271040">Although the bill is complex, the new framework that will govern not-for-profit corporations should considerably simplify and clarify the role of these corporations in our society, both for their members and directors and for the general public. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1271041">It is exceedingly clear that extensive changes must be made to the Canada Corporations Act. For that reason, the Bloc Québécois is in favour of the principle underlying the bill. However, it is evident that some aspects of the bill must be examined in committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271042">The Bloc Québécois supports this bill for a number of reasons. First of all, the process for establishing a not-for-profit will be considerably streamlined and much more transparent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271043"> The act currently requires not-for-profit corporations to keep detailed accounts of their activities but does not require disclosure of these accounts. Bill <Document DbId="3628831" Type="3">C-4</Document> requires not-for-profits to make their financial records available to their members, directors and officers, as well as to the Director. This will permit directors and officers to better manage and supervise the corporation, to monitor the financial situation of the organization between annual meetings and to ensure that funds are used only in the pursuit of the stated goals and objectives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271044">The bill also includes a provision to ensure a fair balance between transparency and accountability on one hand and privacy on the other. An organization can apply to the Director for an exemption from disclosing its accounts to its members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271045">The Canada Corporations Act currently allows anyone to obtain the membership list of a not-for-profit organization. The act sets out the possible uses of such a list. Bill <Document DbId="3628831" Type="3">C-4, Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act</Document>, will give this right only to the organization's members, creditors and directors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271046">This provision will facilitate communication among members and enable them to better coordinate their activities; it will require administrators to maintain an up-to-date membership list, thereby further facilitating logistics and administration; and it will protect the members of certain types of not-for-profit organizations from the unauthorized use of such lists. The same provisions were included in the Canada Corporations Act to punish such offences. The problem would be resolved at the source by not making such lists public. Any person wishing to consult the list would have to sign a statutory declaration limiting the ways in which the list is to be used. The bill also calls for a fine of up to $25,000 or up to six months in prison or both for anyone using a list for unauthorized purposes. This reminds us of the CRTC's do not call list. We know that such lists have been sold for about $50 for 6,000 names. People wanted their names on the CRTC list because they did not want to be bothered by telemarketers. This provision would compensate for the cost of updating the lists by removing the requirement to make them available to the general public. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271047">Directors and officers of not-for-profit organizations are currently exposed to numerous liabilities under the provisions of certain pieces of legislation including liability for environmental damages, liability for unpaid salaries, fiduciary duty, and liability for their own negligent actions. They should be relieved of those liabilities. Thus, the new legislation addresses the liabilities of not-for-profit directors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271048">Incorporation creates a legal entity that can be held liable. The organization will protect these people from personal liability when acting according to their responsibilities as defined in the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271049">That is covered in subsection 37(1).</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271050">The bill includes a clear definition of the standards for diligence that do not hold a director liable if he or she has acted honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the corporation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271051">That is covered in subsection 149(1)</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="30">(1030)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1271052">Directors may use the defence of reasonable diligence, which gives them a remedy against unfounded complaints.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271053">This is found in clause 150.1.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271054">There are new provisions to indemnify directors against costs, charges and expenses incurred in respect of an unfounded proceeding or of incidents where the corporation believes the director's actions warrant indemnification.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271055">These provisions are found in clauses 151.1 and 151.5.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271056">The problem with this sort of provision is that highly qualified officers who know the system well might exonerate themselves by invoking the due diligence defence and thus make the members of the organization pay collectively for their errors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271057">With regard to efficiency, replacing the letters patent system, involving a sort of order signed by the minister, with an as of right system of incorporation makes it much easier to set up not-for-profit organizations. First, the discretionary approval process would disappear and the incorporation process would be simplified, giving corporations greater flexibility. This process would also be more efficient and less expensive, both for corporations and for the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271058">Second, eliminating the obligation to have by-laws approved gives corporations the flexibility to create by-laws to meet their particular needs. It is high time the minister's discretionary authority in this area was abolished. This will increase not only the credibility of not-for-profit organizations, but public confidence in them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271059">I would also like to take this opportunity to point out the main issues the Bloc Québécois and many representatives of not-for-profit organizations have with Bill <Document DbId="3628831" Type="3">C-4</Document> and the Canada Corporations Act. The Canada Corporations Act currently includes a classification system for not-for-profit organizations. The bill still does not include any mechanisms to correct this situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271060">For the government, the new act does not need a classification system because the framework is permissive and flexible, allowing organizations to choose how to apply many provisions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271061">However, according to the national charities and not-for-profit law section of the Canadian Bar Association, not including a general classification system is a major flaw in this bill. It then becomes important to specify if the not-for-profit organization is charitable, mutualist, political or even religious, because they would be different. I am only trying to highlight various distinctions, but we believe that the committee should tackle this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271062">As well, section 154 of the Canada Corporations Act currently stipulates that the federal minister may grant a charter of incorporation if the corporation thereby created pursues objects “to which the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada extends, of a national, patriotic, religious, philanthropic, charitable, scientific, artistic, social, professional or sporting character, or the like objects.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271063">But it appears that the proposed new legislation would not require a not-for-profit organization to include in its statutes the objects it intends to pursue, thus sidestepping the whole notion of specifying what action an organization can take in accordance with its goals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271064">Since we know that the federal Parliament only has jurisdiction over organizations that do not have provincial goals, this raises the following question: Why does the bill not include some provision to oversee what falls under federal jurisdiction? The Bloc Québécois feels that this question should be studied in committee.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="35">(1035)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1271065">These are legitimate issues that the Bloc Québécois is trying to defend. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271066">Under section 92 of the Constitution, managing the social economy, volunteering and community activities falls within provincial jurisdiction. As set out in that section, all matters of a merely local or private nature fall under Quebec's exclusive jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271067">I repeat; it is important to note that the federal Parliament has jurisdiction over only those organizations that do not pursue provincial objects. Section 92, subsection 11 of the Constitution Act, 1867 grants the incorporation of companies with provincial objects specifically to the provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271068">Accordingly, there seems to be a serious flaw in the bill and it must be carefully examined to avoid any potential conflict between the provinces and the federal government. The bill must be amended to limit its application to not-for-profit corporations that operate in several provinces, that have offices in several provinces or whose object comes under federal jurisdiction. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271069">Adding these limitations is not mandatory per se. Constitutionally, the federal government does not have the authority to legislate in areas of Quebec jurisdiction. However, to avoid any confusion that could arise from the new wording of the legislation, it would be wise to include provisions limiting the scope of its application.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271070">At the beginning of my speech, I said that, for some time now, representatives of not-for-profit corporations have been calling for amendments to bring the Canada Corporations Act up to date. For reasons of transparency, efficiency and fairness, the Bloc Québécois believes that these amendments are legitimate and essential. However, certain points need to be clarified in committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271071">Whether on matters of classification or the jurisdictions of each level of government, we believe that the committee must provide clear answers. The representatives of not-for-profit corporations deserve to be able to work with a Canada Corporations Act that effectively meets their needs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1271072">Mr. Speaker, the previous questioner lamented that the bill was very long and had a lot of details that gave him some concern. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271073">The bill does cover a lot of different things and it does provide a comprehensive view of some of the important provisos that will be necessary to ensure the integrity of the not-for-profit sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271074">The area I want to comment on is with regard to the coming into force of the regulations. The member may want to comment on this. The bill has a substantial section on the regulations. One of the regulation provisos indicates that the governor in council, basically the cabinet, can establish regulations. It gives cabinet the power to define certain terms used in the bill but they are not defined in the bill, which I find very unusual.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271075">The bill provides substantive latitude and causes me a bit of concern with regard to the facility to be able to change the scope of legislation through regulation rather than through the legislation itself. In normal cases, regulations are enabled by the legislation itself. I raise this from the standpoint that I hope the committee will look at the extensive provisions allowing for regulations to be put forward. In my own view, they appear to be fairly broad and sweeping and there may be items here that should be incorporated into the legislation as it exists rather than at some other time at the discretion of cabinet.</ParaText>

A Liberal colleague mentioned earlier that the bill was tabled about ten years ago but never adopted. My colleague raised the fact that the bill in question applies to organizations with a national, patriotic, religious or other purpose. They may be of all sorts. However, the bill does not require these organizations to reveal their reason for being.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271080">It is somewhat illogical for a bill to define the objects of these organizations but then to not require the organization to state the reason for incorporation. We come across inconsistencies and duplication in Quebec's and Canada's jurisdictions all the time. In our ridings, not-for-profits are mostly local organizations. Thus, it is quite rare to find organizations working in several provinces or throughout Canada.</ParaText>

Part of this bill provides greater protection for directors. In the past, directors were not keen on the idea of being held liable for the organization. New measures would make them a little less liable and would help them defend themselves. These measures did not exist in the past and, as a result, some volunteers did not want to take on the role of director or chair of these organizations. </ParaText>

I would note first that the bill first surfaced in the House in 2004 under the then Liberal government. It was never dealt with and it came back as Bill C-262 in 2008 and here it is again. It has been about five years that the bill in various forms has been before the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271094">I want to begin by speaking about the not-for-profit sector. I am very fortunate to represent a riding, <Affiliation DbId="128493" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation>, that has a whole diversity of absolutely incredible and amazing not-for-profit organizations, some of which would be under these federal regulations. They perform the most valuable service not only in our local community but nationally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271095">As we debate the bill we need to pay tribute and acknowledge the incredible value that the not-for-profit sector provides in this country. There has been a very long history in Canada of not-for-profit work. Whether it is in housing, cooperatives, delivery of services, volunteer work, or advocacy, there is a tremendous history in this country of voluntary organizations where people give their all and are literally on the front line delivering services and providing information to the citizens of Canada in many diverse communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271096">It is very important for parliamentarians to recognize that if we ever put a price tag on the work that is being done in the voluntary sector we would be talking about billions of dollars. Certainly if these services and programs were being delivered directly by government, we would be talking about billions of dollars. We should recognize that the work that is done by not-for-profits in our communities is something that we benefit from. It is part of a strong civil society. It is part of a strong democratic society. Over the years the biggest struggle and challenge that not-for-profits have had is the struggle to stay in existence, not from a legal point of view, but from a financial point of view. Government funding has been withdrawn and we have seen government programs cut back, federally and provincially, and sometimes even locally, although most often it has been the local government that has had to pick up the slack.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271097">The not-for-profit sector and our non-profit organizations have had to rely more and more on voluntary contributions and donations. They are always scrambling for money. The biggest issue facing the voluntary sector is not 170 pages of <I>Robert's Rules of Order</I> and a regime of putting everyone under one size fits all, it is the question of stable long-term funding. Long gone are the days when non-profit organizations could rely on core funding to continue with their core operations and then expand to whatever programs they were doing. Now every organization, I dare to say, spends probably one-quarter or more of its time writing grant applications, chasing down every small bit of money that they can in order to develop their programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271098">In my riding of Vancouver East there are organizations that are literally on the front line. They are literally dealing with life and death situations. These organizations are democratic. They are transparent. Everything that they do is out there for people to see and to become involved in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271099">In looking at the bill, I have some very serious questions as to why we are so focused on a regulatory regime for not-for-profits when we are completely missing the point of what is the real crux of the issue for non-profits in this country. The NDP, in going through this 170 page bill clause by clause and looking at the incredibly detailed micromanagement requirements that are in there, these organizations will now have to go through various hoops and there are processes and regulations involving a lot of paperwork and reporting requirements. It is absolutely incredible. It is 170 pages of things they have to note and make sure are followed up.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="55">(1055)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1271100">I certainly have a concern that the bill in its current form will make it very difficult to attract new directors and volunteers in the not-for-profit sector. Anybody faced with this massive regulation would say, “I came here to do good work. I came here to make a contribution to my community. I came here to make good decisions. I came here to help people,” and all of a sudden that person is faced with having to deal with a massive bureaucratic regime, where one size fits all right across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271101">We have to seriously question whether or not the bill, if it is adopted in its current form, would have a counter-effect. Maybe it is being put forward from the point of view of transparency and accountability, but it may have the effect of turning people right off and asking why on earth they would get involved in doing this work when there are so many requirements and responsibilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271102">I listened to the Conservative member say that the bill is about being transparent and more accountable. That leads one to believe that the status quo is not transparent and is not accountable. There are non-profit organizations that run into trouble. Any group in society from time to time may face difficulties. There are sometimes instances where there are criminal activities taking place. There are all kinds of legislation, measures and protections to deal with that, but the sense that somehow not-for-profit organizations are not transparent and accountable is a very false premise. I certainly want to put that to rest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271103">Another concern that we have about the bill is that it does not address the relationship between charity status, Revenue Canada and the issue of advocacy. This has been a long-standing debate. There are organizations that are very concerned about the severe limits that are put on them to do advocacy work. Somehow advocacy has become a negative word. It has become a negative component to the work that is done. However, what I see in my community is that the advocacy work, which does not mean that it is partisan, to uphold people's rights, whether it is in legal aid, housing or groups that have been very marginalized, is very important for the not-for-profit sector. This issue has not been dealt with at all. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1271157">In 2007, he suggested that a female member of the Ontario legislature should be home “baking cookies” rather than attending a political event. Last week he complained that he and friends went to a popular Ottawa Chinese restaurant “if we didn't have a girlfriend who could cook”. He then accused the Chinese-Canadians of serving up barbecued cat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271158">Now Warren Kinsella has turned his belligerence against a popular Canadian journalist and artist, Pierre Bourque. Mr. Kinsella called him a dork for his artistic sensitivity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271159">Mr. Bourque received warmest thanks from the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall for an oil painting Mr. Bourque sent them as a wedding gift. They did not think he was a dork for sharing his talent, unlike Mr. Kinsella.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271160">Warren Kinsella's recent comments have hammered women's equality, racial tolerance and, most recently, artistic expression. It is time for the Liberal leader to ask, once again, for his hand-picked senior adviser to apologize to all Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1271174">This ruling will have an enormous impact across the country. The Supreme Court has made it clear that, from now on, when the federal government provides a service—any program, any department—it will have to take the particular needs of the linguistic minority into account.</ParaText>

The ruling would not have been possible before Bill S-3 was passed. That happened under a Liberal government.

More than $276 million in new money in support of arts and culture, which is unheard of in Canada. A grand total of almost $530 million of funding are committed in this budget to the arts.

              <ParaText id="1271404">Madam Speaker, it is very nice to see you in the Chair. I know the people of <Affiliation DbId="128236" Type="2">Victoria</Affiliation> are very proud of you being our Assistant Deputy Speaker.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271405">Before question period I was talking about this massive bill of about 170 pages, Bill <Document DbId="3628831" Type="3">C-4</Document>, that deals with the regulation of not-for-profit corporations. In my comments I was talking about advocacy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271406">One of the problems we have with the bill is that it does not address the core issues and the critical issues that are facing non-profit organizations in this country. One of those issues is the need to deal with advocacy. I find it very interesting that somehow this has become almost a taboo thing because of restrictions from Revenue Canada because of the charitable status.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271407"> I do not know why it is that the notion of advocacy has taken on this very partisan, politicized meaning from the government's point of view. I am someone who has worked in the non-profit sector for many years before I was elected as a city councillor and then as an MP, so I am very familiar with the non-profit sector and how important it is in community development and building healthy communities. Advocacy is very much a part of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271408">Even when organizations have charitable status, they should be able to do advocacy. There is nothing wrong with advocating for the people we represent and for whom we are working. This is particularly true in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="128493" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation> where we have many people who are very vulnerable and at risk, whether they are homeless, living far below the poverty line or drug users who have been very marginalized by our health care system and by criminal enforcement. Many organizations do incredible work right on the front line in helping people, not only with their daily needs of surviving and going up against the system, but also in advocating for people's rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271409">To me, this is a very important function and a very important responsibility that is part of our civil society. It is part of our non-profit structure and part of the history that we have in the way not-for-profits work in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271410">Some not-for-profits simply deliver service and programs, which is exemplary and, of course, needs to be done. However, as I said in my earlier remarks, they and all groups lack stable, long-term and core funding. It is so hard for so many organizations now to survive. People are relying on whatever private donations they can get. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271411">It is interesting to note that in the United States there is a much bigger system of private foundations that do provide huge support to charitable and not-for-profit organizations. In Canada, we have had more of a history of different levels of government recognizing the importance and value of non-profit organizations and actually providing public funding to them. That is a very legitimate thing and it is a very wise use of taxpayer dollars. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271412">However, since the 1990s, every group we talk to, and I could talk to any number of groups in my community, whether it is women's organizations, housing organizations or people involved in legal services, they have all faced unbelievable cutbacks over the years. The erosion of government funding, particularly core funding, has had a very dramatic impact on the non-profit sector. It has left people scrambling to find little bits and pieces of money from this foundation or that foundation. Sometimes it is a matter of $5,000 or $10,000 to keep themselves going.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271413">I wanted to raise that issue during the debate on the bill because it seems to me that the bill is so focused on the regulatory approach for non-profits that it is missing the huge issue of what we need to be addressing for the non-profit sector in Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1271414">I think it is very unfortunate that we are debating this bill that was first introduced in 2004. It has certainly had a long history. Here we are debating this bill that lays out this mega-regime of <I>Robert's Rules of Order</I> and says that everybody is going to come under this regime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271415">What we should be discussing and what we should be doing, particularly in these economic times when so many people are falling behind and so many people who previously did not rely on organizations like food banks, legal aid or organizations that do advocacy, is helping those people who are now having to turn to those organizations to get the help that they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271416">We are certainly now entering a very critical period in Canadian society where the economic recession is having this incredible impact on communities, people and families where before perhaps they were completely self-sufficient and they did not require the help and assistance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271417">One of the problems that we are facing in our community is the cuts in legal aid. There are a number of non-profit organizations that deliver legal aid services. In the best of times their parameters were fairly restrictive. There is money that goes from the federal government to the provinces for legal aid. This is very much a part of our judicial system and all Canadians should be guaranteed the right to access and opportunity to legal representation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271418">However, as these cutbacks have just come wave after wave, we are now facing a situation in B.C. where low income communities are being hit particularly hard. The organizations that are there, whether it is the UBC Law Student's Society that provides legal aid or the legal aid system itself, they are now under severe pressure trying to meet the demand as more and more people, who may have previously had their own resources to deal with the judicial system, are now unable to do so. That is a very serious situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271419">In looking at this bill I know that other colleagues of mine in the NDP are very concerned about this bill. We are concerned about the scope of the bill. We are concerned about how far reaching it is and how it may dampen enthusiasm and the involvement of people. When we read the bill, the things that are required of people individually, as well as the organization in question if it falls under the mandate of this bill, are quite incredible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271420">We have a lot of concern about how broad a net this bill casts in terms of creating a system where organizations basically have very little choice to perform in a way that maybe they have evolved over the years. It seems to me that this idea that there is only one standard to uphold accountability or transparency is really quite false.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271421">The fact is the vast majority of non-profit organizations are very democratic. They are transparent. They are accountable. It is in their very nature to do that because their very reason for being is based on community service. It is based on service to society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271422">Therefore, these organizations tend to be very open and straightforward about what they are doing. They have nothing to hide. It is not like there is some big multinational corporation that is involved in goodness knows what kind of financial transactions and trying to skim and move money, such as what we see in this financial crisis that we have before us now. Non-profit organizations are not really in that kind of game. They are in service to the community. Even the large organizations, whether they be the Red Cross or others, have a different kind of mandate. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1271423">One of the concerns that we have is that it may be necessary for us to see a framework of regulations that would ensure better accountability for some of these large organizations that do engage in business opportunities. It seems that this is now being cast over every organization that falls within the scope and the mandate of the bill, so we have a problem with that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271424">I did want to express the concerns that we have about the bill, but most of all I want to thank the incredible non-profit organizations in my community that provide an amazing service. I do not think I could do the job that I do if they were not doing what they do. We work in very close partnership with each other. We all need to recognize these organizations and what they do in our communities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1271426">Halifax is the home of many non-profit associations as well. One, for example, is the Ecology Action Centre, which is Nova Scotia's largest environmental organization. Since 1971 the EAC has been working to build a healthier, more sustainable Nova Scotia, and it is a strong and respected voice in our province on environmental issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271427">My question is actually about funding for non-profit organizations. She talked about the regulation of non-profit organizations. One strong program at the EAC was the steer clean program, which was a federal initiative to retire old vehicles which were bad polluters in exchange for sustainable transportation incentives like a free bus pass or discounts on bikes. This innovative program was cancelled last spring, so that means we have lost greenhouse gas reductions in our province, the EAC lost a staff person, and the Ecology Action Centre lost some of its capacity to be a strong voice for sustainable transportation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271428">I wonder if the hon. member would share with us her thoughts on today's focus of the debate, which is about changes to governance of non-profit organizations as opposed to a real discussion on ensuring that non-profit organizations can continue to do the excellent work that they are doing.</ParaText>

The Auditor General's report from the Environment Commissioner slammed the government for its complete lack of progress on climate change and pointed out that there is no transparency or accountability and very negligible improvements. The local organization in Halifax is really doing the job, but yet it is struggling for funds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271431">The member has really pinpointed the problem with the bill. We are dealing with a sort of regulatory regime about governance when most of these organizations are doing just fine. We are completely missing the need that they have which is to have some financial security so they can continue their work. Members in the NDP will continue to raise this because it is an important priority. We understand the importance of the work of these organizations.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="128753" Type="2">Hon. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1271432">Madam Speaker, it is a true pleasure to speak today to Bill <Document DbId="3628831" Type="3">C-4</Document>, a way to assist non-profit organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271433">I also want to compliment you, Madam Speaker, for being the Deputy Speaker. I know Victoria is very proud, being from a neighbouring riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271434">Mahatma Gandhi said that poverty is one of the worst forms of violence. We know that it robs a person's soul, and sometimes robs the desire to live, particularly if there is no hope or see any way or opportunity to actually get out of a poverty trap. In response to that, we have some 161,000 Canadian not-for-profit organizations, and 19,000 of them are under federal jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271435">I would also like to salute that this represents some 12 million volunteers. These volunteers donate some two billion hours of their time free of charge every year. That is a staggering testament to the courage and charitableness of Canadians from coast to coast. There are about two million full time equivalents of people who are hired and who work in the not-for-profit sector, which represents some 11% of our economic workforce.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271436">The budget actually neglected this very important part of our economy. The fact of the matter is those volunteers, those NGOs have a huge duplicative effect. Where they have that duplicative effect is in helping those who are most underprivileged in our society, giving them a hand out, and enabling them to be able to elevate themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271437"> They feed those who are hungry. They clothe those who do not have proper clothing. They care for those who are sick. They donate their time to enable our environmental and cultural heritage to live on into the future. They are Canadian heroes, unsung, quietly going about their work, day in and day out, week in and week out, year after year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271438">In this bill, and in the budget, it neglects to deal with some of the fundamental problems that the NGO community faces in Canada today. To showcase some of the great non-governmental organizations we have, I started up a website. It is called Canadaaid.ca. I would encourage viewers out there to check out Canadaaid.ca.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271439">This website actually showcases people here at home who are doing work in Canada and abroad, people like Gerald and Nicole Hartwig, who are building schools abroad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271440"> The Compassionate Resource Warehouse and Dell Wergeland, who you know, Madam Speaker, being from Victoria, do an extraordinary job. They have sent hundreds of millions of dollars worth of needed supplies to those who are most impoverished in the world. They have done it all with volunteers, many of whom are actually our veterans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271441">What charitable organizations face is an overweening and excessive degree of reporting. They all agree that fair and accountable reporting must occur. Imagine being part of a small NGO, a small group of volunteers working hard to help those who are impoverished. What happens is they often have to pay thousands and thousands of dollars that has to come from their donations to pay for the overweening administrative obligations that are placed upon them, much of which is unnecessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271442">The fact of the matter is that the CRA, Revenue Canada, is disconnected from the NGO community. It has not sat down and listened to their needs and worked with them to enable them to have a proper structure that they can report fairly, openly and transparently as to what moneys they are receiving and how they use them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271443">I would strongly encourage the <Affiliation DbId="128683" Type="4">Minister of National Revenue</Affiliation> to sit down and encourage the bureaucrats to work with the NGO community. This is absolutely essential, if we are not going to choke the ability of NGOs to work and help those who are most underprivileged.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271444">Also, I do not think the Canadian public is aware of this, but Revenue Canada had cuts, particularly in the charities branch. What happened was, in response to that, Revenue Canada let go a lot of its employees and rehired people who had less professional capabilities. What happened as a result of that is burnout amongst the people who could not handle the work, and charities were not able to engage Revenue Canada in a meaningful way.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1271445">The other side of this is right now we have overzealous members of Revenue Canada fanning out across our country. They are going after charitable organizations tooth and nail. They are driving them into the ground so much that they will have to close their doors. In fact, some of them have had to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in accounting and legal fees to simply answer the questions that Revenue Canada has asked, most of which are completely useless and unnecessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271446">In their zealous desire to go after these charitable organizations, they do not see are the downstream effects. They are hurting the very people who help those in need. Charitable organizations do the lion's share to help those who are most needy. Governments are not going to do it, and in many cases it should not. However, what has filled the gap are these large numbers of charitable organizations, working with minimal amounts of funds to do great things and massively expand the care they provide to those who need it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271447">This has absolutely become a crisis. I know full well that charitable groups in my riding are about to close their doors. The impact on those who are most impoverished will be quite significant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271448">I strongly recommend that the government implement the solutions in this bill, which are necessary for a streamlined, effective way to ensure that transparency within the NGO community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271449">The other thing the government ought to do is enable people to donate more to charitable groups. Right now, during this time of great need, during this time of the economic turmoil across our country, there has never been a greater time to encourage donations to the NGOs, which help those most in need. Right now for charitable donations up to $200, we receive a 15% tax credit. For donations over $200, it is 29%. It makes more sense, and I have a motion is this regard, to ensure that charitable organizations receive the same tax benefits as political parties. Donations to political parties receive much higher tax benefits than those given to charitable organizations. Why not make them equivalent?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271450">Alternatively, the government could allow Canadians to donate up to $15,000 to charitable groups and receive a 50% tax credit. Anything above $15,000 would go back to the 29% tax credit, which is in effect now, for donating more than $200. This would inject adrenalin into the charitable donations. In fact, when we asked Canadians, and there were some interesting studies on this, if they were able to get a higher tax credit, would they donate more, 53% said yes. Why does the government not do this? It would provide a significant benefit, at minimal cost, with a huge multiplier effect for those most in need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271451">The other thing that could be done, and my colleague mentioned it before, is allow foundations in Canada to develop in a more fruitful way. The United States has much larger foundations, with more money. We could do that in our country. This would provide a huge benefit for the civil society sector to utilize funds to help those most in need and it would also to invest in the cultural and environmental legacy in our great nation, which would be beneficial for all of us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271452">Do members not find it an affront to common decency that people who make less than $20,000 a year pay tax? How do people survive on less than $20,000 a year? They cannot and as a result they get caught in the poverty trap. Why do we not amend the tax code? I know we could this because I spoke to our finance critic about it when we were in government. I have a private member's bill called the “Canadian low-income supplement”. The bill would ensure that people would get a $2,000 rebate, cash in hand, if they made less than $20,000 a year. That number would decline to zero at $40,000. This would put real money into the hands of those most in need. I strongly encourage the government to pursue that course of action.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1271453">On EI, my colleagues have provided solutions to increase EI benefits and decrease the amount of time that one has to work. I also encourage the following.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271454"> For those who have lost their jobs, we do not know whether the government will provide EI benefits for them. Just because those people lost their jobs before the budget went through, does it not make sense that those people, who have been victims of the global economic tsunami, should have the same economic benefit changes in the budget? We would like to see the government come clean on that. We think it is an act of fundamental fairness. Whether people lose their jobs next month or lost them two months ago, these people need help. They do not have money to survive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271455">My colleagues have introduced some very sensible changes, for a two year period of time. Those changes would help those most in need, and those people spend the money. They need to put food on the table. They need medications when they are ill. They need to pay rent. They need a roof over their heads. They need to pay their mortgages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271456">Furthermore, if people have houses and have lost their jobs, why are they ineligible to receive EI? They have mortgage payments. What are they going to do? Sell their house, and go where? Are they going to go on the street? Are they going to find a place to rent in our community, as an example, where the available rental units are less than one per cent? They cannot do it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271457">Our objective is to enable people to maintain as much of a reasonable standard of living as they possibly can during this economic turmoil so they will not be hurt, and hurt they can be, hurt they are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271458">On the issue of first nations, I have five first nations communities in my riding. In some of those communities, in which they have some really superb first nations leadership, the conditions in which those people live is frankly inhumane. Whether it is the Pacheedaht reserve or some others, in Sooke or Beecher Bay, we have some great leaders. Those people need to be encouraged, yet they are not, in part because of the following.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271459">First, the government put a two per cent cap on funding for first nations communities. Does that make sense when the population of first nations communities is growing by more than two per cent? That does not even take into consideration the increase cost of our standard of living. It does not account for inflation. In effect, because of this cap, they are going backward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271460">Inflation alone is tearing away at that. Increased population growths will also tear away at that, so there is less money today than there was five, six or seven years ago. That makes no sense whatsoever. It is fundamentally important that the government release that two per cent cap and give the moneys needed, with a multiplier that is congruent with inflation plus population increases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271461">The implication of not doing this is the following. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271462">Do members know that aboriginals families, and this is particularly offensive, receive between $2,000 and $9,000 less per child than non-aboriginal families? Why? What does that mean? It means that those children cannot have books. They cannot get computers. They do not get other school supplies. They cannot hire teachers. The schools are overcrowded. The infrastructure collapses. Some of the schools are toxic. We would not want to see any child trying to study in those schools. Frequently there are not even enough schools to train the kids. How can these children, many of whom are living in impoverished circumstances, get out of that poverty trap?They cannot.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271463">I would also like to see the government look at the Indian Act and work with the AFN and other groups to modify the Indian Act, which is a racist document and a rock around the neck of aboriginal communities in their desire to develop. How can they possibly develop if we have that type of act? They have many more hurdles to overcome in order to develop, so how can they take care of themselves?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271464">There is fabulous leadership in Chief Gordon Planes in Sooke and Chief Russ Chipps in Beecher Bay. They have some great initiatives that they would like to pursue, but they cannot because of the Indian Act and the obstacles it presents to them.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1271465">I was on the Pacheedaht reserve in my riding a little while ago. I could put my fist through the walls. There is mould, they are toxic and falling apart. This is in our Canada. Canadians often do not see this because we have to take a bit of a detour to look at it. I ask them to please look at this. See what is in our neighbourhoods and communities. Look at what we have in our country. They will find conditions rival to that in third world nations half a world away.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271466">This is our Canada and it is a pox on our houses that this is allowed to continue. This cannot be allowed to continue. It must be addressed as issues of fundamental fairness and basic humanity. I would like to see the <Affiliation DbId="111563" Type="96">Minister of Indian Affairs</Affiliation> go to these schools and clinics, take a look at the conditions in which these people live. I would like him to say that this cannot continue and work with first nations leaders to resolve this. Many of these reserves have extraordinary natural resources that can be developed, but it must be allowed to happen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271467">On the schooling issue, while there was some money for infrastructure for schools, which I complement the government on, they also need money for soft costs such as for the teachers, books, computers and access to schools. The children in the Pacheedaht reserve have to travel hours into soup to go to school, which means they cannot avail themselves of normal child activities and programs such as music, physical education and team sports that help to build them as they go through life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271468">It is fundamentally important for the government to grasp this. We are willing to work. We have some great people in the Liberal Party, and in all parties, who are very willing to work with the government to implement the solutions to address these issues, which are human and critical and which must be resolved as an act of basic humanity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271469">The public expects us to come in here and do things quickly, which we would all love to do. The frustration that I think all of us in the House feel comes from the desire and our willingness to address the concerns of our citizens, meeting the glacial pace in which things move around here. In fact, they move somewhere between glacial and full stop. That is how fast things move. However, the implication of that is the failure to address some very critical things. In 1998 the House passed a resolution for a head start program for children. This is the most fundamental and easiest way to have an important impact on our children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271470">In the last minute and a half I have, I want to talk about international affairs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271471"> There are some wonderful people at CIDA. However, the government needs to resolve an internal issue in coordination. The treasury board needs to change in order to liberate CIDA so it may work on the necessary international development projects. Our government needs to look outside of itself and understand that Canadians have the willingness, desire and ability to deal with our fundamental and large international challenges, rooted, in part, in the millennium development goals and those objectives that we signed onto.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271472">The three Cs, corruption, conflict and a lack of capacity, are not dealt with adequately internationally for many reasons. The failure to do that causes impoverished countries to continue in their poverty tracts. We have an opportunity to tap into Canada's capacity and the willingness of Canadians to donate their services to build up capacity in developing countries. We need to develop integrated plans such as building up primary health care systems in developing countries. Rather than looking at HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, we need to work on building an integrated public health care strategy. We know the simple things have the most effective bang for the buck in development and improving population health. Corruption has to be dealt with by improving the public service. We have the ability to transform and translate our public service abilities to these countries.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1271473">In closing, we have a great ability within this House and our country to deal with the fundamental challenge of poverty here at home and abroad. I strongly encourage the government to work with the rest of us to tackle this inscrutable enemy of humankind.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1271474">Madam Speaker, I listened intently to the hon. member who talked about a number of different things. He elaborated on the slowness that legislation moves through the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271475">We are talking today about the Canada not-for-profit corporations bill. He spoke very little about that, but I want to ask him a question on it. Does he support the phasing out of the old legislation, the Canada Corporations Act, and providing a phase-in to the new act? It would help the not-for-profit sector. It is a good move. It updates the legislation. Will he help in moving the legislation along quickly or is he going to talk about a lot of other things and cause a slow glacial movement of legislation in the House?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271476">The other question regards first nations. The member was involved with the former Liberal government for 13 long dark years and things did move very slowly. In my riding I have an excellent relationship with the Kwantlen First Nation, which for decades asked for help to stop the erosion of McMillan Island falling into the Fraser River. The former Liberal government was asked numerous times for help but it did not help. Again it was a very slow glacial movement. However, within months of our becoming the government in 2006, that problem was solved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271477">On the residential schools apology, again, the first nations were waiting for an apology. That apology happened under our government. I think the member is noticing a dramatic change in speeding up good legislation. With regard to matrimonial rights for first nations women, I think the member voted against that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271478">Maybe he could share why he is involved with a legacy of slowdown. Will he now support a government that is getting it done?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1271479">Madam Speaker, I want to correct the hon. member. I was in the Liberal government for a year and a half, which was after I had been on his side for 10 years, but he might not have been around at that time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271480">On the issue of Bill <Document DbId="3628831" Type="3">C-4</Document>, we compliment the government on bringing forward changes to the Canada Corporations Act. That act went back to 1917. However, we want to make sure that the legislation contains changes that will liberate the NGOs and enable them to do the wonderful work that they do, and that it is not a Gordian knot that introduces numerous other administrative hurdles and obstacles that costs them a lot of money. We will move this legislation forward but we want to make sure that it contains the effective solutions to liberate the not-for-profit sector, not administrative requirements that would hamper their ability to do their job, which would cause them to move at a glacial pace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271481">On the issue of first nations, it has been extremely frustrating for first nations communities to see many of the actions of the government. The Conservatives have done some good things and I give them credit for that, but the government has not done anything on some of the fundamental issues of investing in things that enable first nations communities to take care of themselves. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271482">There was an example in the long list of solutions I was trying to give to the government in my speech. The 2% cap on first nations funding must be lifted. With inflation and with the population growth rate which is much higher than 2%, it is actually eroding the funding capabilities of first nations to help themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271483">I would ask my hon. colleague and his government to implement those solutions and the others in my speech.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1271485">I want to share a story from my riding. The Nova Scotia--Gambia Association is a non-profit development organization based in Canada, but it works with West African partners to pursue initiatives for equitable and sustainable futures for youth. Every year in Halifax the NSGA holds an African night. There is African food, culture, music and wonderful speakers. It is an excellent event. I have attended it. It holds this event because the money it receives from CIDA is not enough to fund the great work it is doing in West Africa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271486">Does the member agree that while we do need to consider ways to strengthen the regulations regarding not-for-profit organizations, we should simultaneously be having discussions about secure funding so that this work can continue?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1271488">The first thing that the government could do and what is perhaps more important is to enable the NGOs to generate more money themselves. They could do that with the tax changes I mentioned. It would actually take pressure off the government to fund more by enabling citizens to donate more. As I said before, 53% of Canadians would like to donate more if there was a more attractive tax credit. That is critically important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271489">To address the member's other question, the government should work with the NGOs to ensure there is a transparent and functional accounting system that does not drown the NGOs in red tape.</ParaText>

Perhaps the member might be able to present some pricing for the ideas that he has suggested today. He could get his point across a little better that way but also separate himself from the NDP members who never seem to attach a cost to their wish list.

If the government were to provide a more lucrative tax credit to the individual donor, we would see a vast increase in monies that are available because the multiplier effect is great. It would actually save some of the taxpayers' money that the government uses in some of its programs. The principle behind it is one which I know my hon. friend very much adheres to as we do. That principle is to give people the opportunity to take care of themselves. We should maximize the capabilities that we have in our citizenry. We should ensure that people have the tools to do the great things they can do and make sure that government is not getting in the way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271494">That is why we would like to see this bill have an administrative structure that listens to the NGO community and adopts a framework that is easy to implement, that is open, transparent and has true accountability. My friend from Victoria, Henry McCandless, a former assistant deputy minister in the Office of the Auditor General said that true accountability is the obligation on the part of senior government officials and elected officials to tell the public what they are doing, why they are doing it and how much it is going to cost and then tell them what they have done with that in the future.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1271495">Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak to Bill <Document DbId="3628831" Type="3">C-4, An Act respecting not-for-profit corporations and certain other corporations</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271496">I am surprised. Earlier, I was listening to the Liberal member answer a question from the Conservative member. Each was accusing the other. The Liberal member said that the Conservatives move at a slow, glacial pace. The Conservatives said that, in their day, the Liberals moved even more slowly, more glacially. Now that they are in bed together, I can only speculate as to whether things are still slow and glacial, but it always makes me smile. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271497">People have been asking for new not-for-profit corporation legislation since 1999. I will go into detail later on. We will support the bill. Nevertheless, we want our House of Commons colleagues to respect provincial areas of jurisdiction. Under section 92 of the Constitution, the provinces are responsible for management of the social economy, volunteering and community activities. All matters of a “merely local or private nature” fall under the exclusive purview of Quebec and the provinces. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271498">As proud defenders of the Quebec nation, we must ensure that this bill does not encroach on Quebec's areas of jurisdiction. Not-for-profit organizations operating exclusively in Quebec are already governed by Part III of Quebec's Companies Act. We just want to make sure that this bill will not prevent not-for-profit organizations from operating. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271499">It is important to note that the federal Parliament has jurisdiction only over organizations that do not have provincial objects. Subsection 11 of section 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867, specifically gives the provinces jurisdiction over “the incorporation of companies with provincial objects”. Currently, section 154 of the Canada Corporations Act states that the federal minister may grant an organization the right to incorporate if it is carrying on “objects, to which the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada extends, of a national, patriotic, religious, philanthropic, charitable, scientific, artistic, social, professional or sporting character, or the like objects”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271500">This is important, because not-for-profit organizations are currently governed by the Canada Corporations Act, which is why we are amending that act. This section pertains to organizations that come under the legislative authority of Parliament. It appears that clause 4 of the new bill would not require a not-for-profit organization to state its purpose in its articles of incorporation. Clearly, it could be confusing if the organization's purpose is not stated. Inevitably, the result could be interference in the provinces' exclusive jurisdictions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271501">It will therefore come as no surprise that, even though we support this bill, we would like to see it go to committee so that our colleagues understand the situation and we make sure that the bill as introduced does not conflict with section 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867. We believe that the bill should be amended to limit its scope to not-for-profit organizations that operate or have offices in more than one province or whose purpose comes under federal jurisdiction, in order to respect the spirit of part II of the current Canada Corporations Act, which pertains to not-for-profit organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271502">That is our goal, as worthy representatives of the Quebec nation, in order to protect the interests of Quebeckers and especially not-for-profit organizations operating in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271503">Earlier, someone mentioned the slow movement of legislation. If we look back at the history of this bill, we can see how we have come to this point in 2009. The Canada Business Corporations Act creates the frame of reference, as I said earlier. In recent years, stakeholders have expressed concern that this act is out of date and no longer meets the needs of today's not-for-profit sector.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1271504">The stakeholders publicly asked for reforms to the legislation and in 1999, the task force on the voluntary sector, created by the federal government, asked that improvements be made to the regulatory framework governing the sector. Industry Canada's proposal aimed at updating the Canada Business Corporations Act is part of the task force's plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271505">As far back as July 2000, Industry Canada produced a document entitled Reform of the Canada Corporations Act: The Federal Not-for-Profit Framework Law. After that document was published, the department organized a series of round table discussions in various cities across the country in order to examine the ideas presented in the document. Following the round tables, the government thought it would be a good idea to make concrete proposals. Thus, we can see that some questioning began in 1999 and discussions began in 2000. On November 15, 2004, the Liberal government introduced Bill <Document DbId="1457967" Type="3">C-21</Document>. Of course, since the Liberal government's reign was so short lived, the legislation was never passed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271506">On June 13, 2008, during the second session of the 39th Parliament, the Conservatives took essentially the same bill and reinstated it as Bill <Document DbId="3568474" Type="3">C-62</Document>. In the end, the bill did not pass because the Conservatives, who had promised fixed election dates, decided to force an election. Unfortunately for all those waiting for this act to be modernized, the bill lapsed. On December 3, a similar bill was introduced at first reading by the <Affiliation DbId="128715" Type="4">Minister of State (Small Business and Tourism)</Affiliation>, a Conservative minister. Then the government decided to prorogue the House and the bill died. Finally, on January 28, Bill <Document DbId="3628831" Type="3">C-4</Document> was introduced and will be studied against that backdrop.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271507">I can understand that the Liberals and Conservatives accuse one another of moving at a slow, glacial pace. However, for all those waiting for changes to this law, I hope we will act as quickly as possible and move forward. The Bloc's only request is that the Constitution be respected so that not-for-profit organizations falling under Quebec jurisdiction can truly be viable and not be jeopardized by this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271508">That is what we will do and we will be pleased to participate in all the debates.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1271509">Madam Speaker, I have a few comments with regard to Bill <Document DbId="3628831" Type="3">C-4</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271510">Prior to becoming a member of Parliament, I, as a chartered accountant, had the opportunity to have a number of not-for-profit organizations as clients. As well, in my work in one of the corporate employs that I had in my early career, I was actually involved in the work which introduced the Canada Business Corporations Act and moved it from the Canada Corporations Act and all the continuance provisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271511">I am sure all members will look at the bill and wonder how they will put their minds around the document. I took the opportunity to look at the details. I suspect that if I were to cross out everything that was boilerplate, mirroring the rules, the provisions and the features of the bill that are required under the Canada Business Corporations Act for for-profit corporations, the bill would be about quarter of the size that it is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271512">The bill also contains a number of interesting provisions, and one in which I will take specific interest and hope to be involved in at committee stage is with regard to regulations. I will comment on that in a brief moment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271513">For the record, I would like to indicate that I will be supporting the bill, as I would most bills in the nature of building on an existing foundation of corporate governance, whether it be share capital or non-share capital, profit or not-for-profit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271514">This is a very important bill that we move forward to committee. I very much doubt that the members themselves at this point will be able to speak in very much detail to the risks, the rewards, the benefits or the pitfalls that may exist in the bill without hearing from the experts and the stakeholders in all sectors across the governance model.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271515">However, it is at second reading where all hon. members get an opportunity to raise specific issues or maybe to recommend to the committee that these are areas of interest or of concern. I hope the committee will bring forward the appropriate witnesses so that the questions or the issues can be elaborated on, not only by the government and by departmental officials, but also have the higher level interventions of experts and representatives across the governance spectre to ensure t there are no hidden or unintended consequences. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271516">That is always the problem when we get bills which are substantively omnibus bills to the extend that they do have consequential amendments to a large number of other existing legislation in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271517">If we were to take all of the bills that this particular bill touches, we would probably have a very large pile of reading to do, because some of the changes that occur in here cannot be understood in terms of the amendment being proposed in the bill to another bill. That amendment needs to be read in the context of the bill which it is amending. We need to know, if this is plugged in to some other piece legislation, whether it make sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271518"> These are the kinds of things we rely on: the departmental officials to give us the assurance. We have the responsibility for the legislation but we second that responsibility to a great extent in bills like this to the departmental officials and to the experts. We also seek the input of other witnesses, which helps us to discharge that responsibility for the legislation without being the experts ourselves. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271519">We cannot be experts in all things but we can ask reasonable, fair questions so it can be explained to us. In some cases I like to ask the experts in committee to explain it to me so that my grandmother would understand. I want the explanation in plain and simple language because, if our legislation is not in plain and simple language, when people involved in a broad range of not-for-profit organizations see this, their first reaction will be to wonder whether they will be swamped with more paperwork from government requirements. They will want to know whether it will be cost-effective, whether they will need to hire lawyers to help guide them through the pitfalls in which they may find themselves, whether their organization will be put at risk if they have to come under the rules, whether it will affect the way they do business, and whether they will be subject to other exposures to risk from other stakeholders without knowing who they are. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1271520">All hon. members have a wealth of opportunity to maybe find a little nugget within legislation such as this to consult with not-for-profit organizations in their own community, to ask whether they are even aware of this or if they have an advocacy group on behalf of all the groups across the country in the same or similar businesses that will be there, and to encourage them to come out to the committee or to have representation at the committee, and to let them know that it will not be at no cost to them. For us to do a good job and for us to have them there, we pay the cost to bring them here to ensure they have an opportunity to express the views, concerns or even the questions of these various groups and organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271521">My intervention is maybe an invitation to all hon. members to not be reluctant to open this document and to determine whether there is a nugget in which they can champion or encourage groups and organizations with which they are familiar or with which they have had some undertakings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271522">One of the areas I will be looking is the responsibilities of directors and officers. This is an important aspect of governance life in Canada. The corporate sector at large has had a lot of difficulty with conflicts of interest, fraud, embezzlement and the benefits to people as a consequence of their role in an organization.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271523">Bill <Document DbId="3628831" Type="3">C-4</Document> also addresses the whole area of directors and officers. I think all hon. members would agree that the accountability, the transparency and the openness are important aspects. Part 9 of the bill outlines the duty for directors and officers to manage and supervise management . It addresses the number of directors needed. Sometimes there are closed shops and sometimes there are too many and the work does not get done. The qualifications are extremely important, and members may want to look at that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271524">For directors in the not-for-profits, there are guidelines and things for notice to directors ceasing to hold office, removal of directors, statements of directors, how to fill a vacancy, changing the number, et cetera. The list is very long. The bill addresses those kinds of issues. It would give organizations the opportunity to realize the extent to which they have a responsibility. Each organization under this governance model would provide, if they follow and comply with the legislation, a comfort level to all Canadians from the standpoint of being able to understand that the organization has rules to follow, that they can trust the organization to follow the rules and that there is a compliance mechanism in place to ensure that happens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271525">The other aspect is bylaws and members. In my role as a member and currently the chair of the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics, it does cover the bylaws and members. It basically deals with information about who the members are, what their involvement is and a variety of other things. This is a very important aspect. I am very interested in this from the standpoint of potential privacy issues, potential cyber crime, identity theft, et cetera.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1271526">Finally, I simply want to make a comment with regard to the regulations. There is a section in the bill on regulations which has to do with the coming into force of the legislation. It comes after the very last part of the bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271527">Members probably know that a bill will either say it comes into force upon receiving royal assent or it will say that it comes into force on the date designated by order in council. Usually when a bill requires regulations it will state on a date specified by order in council. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271528"> After we have dealt with a bill in the House of Commons at second reading, it goes to committee where committee members hear from experts and witnesses and departmental officials. The bill may be amended there. After the bill is voted on in committee, it comes back to the House for report stage where more amendments may be proposed by members who were not involved in the process at the committee stage. A vote is then held at that stage. A debate is held at third reading and another vote takes place. The bill will go to the Senate where it will go through virtually the same process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271529">One thing that is not done in the entire process of reviewing a piece of legislation like this bill is that we do not see the regulations. We do not see the regulations when we have to vote to make the bill law. The regulations are the details necessary to supplement or amplify the intent of the bill. Every regulation must be enabled, authorized, in the bill itself. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271530">Members will find that in this legislation there are a substantial number of regulations required which may take six months or a year to be implemented. I know of a bill where three years after its passage, the regulations still have not been fully implemented. The bill as we passed it in this place is not fully functional.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271531">In the past I was chair of the joint Senate and Commons committee on the scrutiny of regulations, but I continue to be a member of that committee in this current Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271532"> I want to follow this particular bill. Even though the bill provides a whole section on definitions to guide the understanding of the bill, one of the requirements is that the governor in council define terms used in the bill which have not been defined in the bill. If something is in the bill and it might require a definition, I do not understand why the definition would not be put in the bill and then the regulation would not be needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271533"> I want to particularly follow that one because it is the first time I have ever seen it. I want to understand why it is that someone thinks something has to be defined in the regulations so that the bill is clear. When we already anticipate today that it may be a problem, why not just put it in the bill? I look through some of these things as a member of Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271534">As I indicated, I will be supporting the bill. However, I need more answers as a legislator before I can enthusiastically endorse every aspect of it. Quite frankly, it is going to take some time before I become fully conversant in all of the nuances of the bill because there are many other pieces of legislation that I would have to ask the Library of Parliament to get for me so that I could look at this in context.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271535">This is a situation which I would characterize as a mission impossible for members of Parliament by themselves and even by their caucuses. They need the experts and the officials. We need to make sure that they know that we are interested in having these matters explained to us, the raison d'être as it were, so that we can do a good job as parliamentarians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1271537">All of us have not-for-profit organizations within our own ridings. In my riding of Davenport there are excellent organizations such as the Working Women Community Centre, the Abrigo Centre and the Working Skills Centre. These not-for-profit agencies deal mainly with immigrants and refugees, and help the vulnerable and those in need in our city. I congratulate them on all their fine work. I am sure the hon. member has many organizations in his own riding that he can also comment upon and thank.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271538">Not-for-profit organizations are essential in our communities. They are the ones that deliver the real services. They are doing a tremendous amount of work for very low pay. They have difficulty raising money and it is not always easy to get funding from different levels of government, but they are doing incredible work. Certainly cities like Toronto would not be liveable and we would not have a country like we do have at the moment if it were not for these agencies.We have to do everything possible to help them out.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1271542">The money for these organizations generally comes from federal and provincial funding programs. They are quite rigidly set on the number of people being served, et cetera, and are very modest. Many of these organizations have very little opportunity to raise money elsewhere, and even if they do, the funding that they may get from the federal or provincial governments may be reduced because they have other sources of revenue. It is almost as though they cannot help themselves. They are stuck.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271543">The most poignant example that I can recall is that Multicultural Services of Peel, when it existed, was approached by a union to organize. The union negotiators demanded that salary levels be increased substantially. That was the contract being sought. The organization had to hire a lawyer. One thing led to another and the organization folded up its tent and went away, because it had no control over what it could pay its people. The salary or compensation per employee in certain areas is designated in the funding package from the federal or provincial governments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271544">These organizations operate on a very narrow budget. There is no fat. It is very lean. A lot of people have asked me why one would want to start a not-for-profit organization. The fact is that it is efficient, it provides services, and it is not meant for growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271545"> I am concerned about the burden on the organizations. I think we all should keep that in mind.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1271549">Madam Speaker, certainly there are examples in our legislative framework and some of the programs, and even the taxation models that we have, that take into account that one size does not fit all. I think that applies to the not-for-profit sector. There are some organizations that are very large, some that are very powerful, in terms of their influence not only on their own community but on the country as a whole. There are other organizations, however, that are very small and, as I indicated, they do not have the resources to do things. When I think of something like the GST, there are different methods to file a GST return which take into account the size or the volume of the business.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1271552">He spoke to the importance of immigrant settlement, which I think is quite fundamental as well. Our esteemed <Affiliation DbId="128431" Type="2">colleague from Beaches--East York </Affiliation> is one of the founders of COSTI, which does an incredible amount of good work across the GTA in dealing with immigrant settlement. This exemplary work is something we should be congratulating as well. We need to ensure that when legislation such as this comes into law it does not burden those organizations but that it helps them. We need to be supportive of them just as they have been supportive of so many communities and so many people in need.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1271553">Madam Speaker, it sounds as though there is a theme going on here, and I tend to agree. However, as an accountant, let me say that there are two ways to improve the bottom line: one is to increase income levels, revenues; the other is to reduce expenses. They both come out to a desired result.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271554">With regard to the not-for-profits, many of their problems pre-exist this bill. This bill would make their situation a little worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271555"> I can say that in my experience the employees of not-for-profit organizations generally involved in the social services sector are the lowest paid and they do the most important work. This is a tragedy. It is a tragedy that with the amount of money allocated by the Government of Canada and the provinces, people who are helping people be better people and help families in need cannot be paid a fair a reasonable salary. It means that the turnover rate in this sector is also very high. That is not good for Canada either.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271556"> We have to advocate not only for some assistance in this bill for those who would be under duress because of additional paperwork and administrative work, which has nothing to do with delivering services, but also to look at the funding levels provided in existing federal programs for these important groups and organizations so that they can sustain a solid staff which has good experience and continuity. That experience and expertise makes a great deal of difference in affecting the lives of Canadians in need.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1271557">Madam Speaker, I wish to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="128094" Type="2">Mississauga South</Affiliation> for shedding some light on some of the issues to which we should be alert, regarding the reform of legislation governing not-for-profits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271558">I am happy to also join the debate today on Bill C-4, an act respecting not-for-profit corporations and certain other corporations. As others have pointed out, this bill is very similar to a bill introduced in 2004 that sought to streamline and reform the regulatory framework of federally incorporated not-for-profits. It seems to me that many of the concerns at that time remain and for that reason I think this bill needs some careful examination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271559">With job losses growing on a daily basis and our social support networks struggling, the work of non-profit organizations is needed now more than ever. Non-profits in my riding of Halifax provide front line services, advocate for those in need, research new ideas, and protect and promote local culture. It is worth noting that smaller provinces like Nova Scotia actually have higher numbers of non-profits relative to their populations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271560">I would like to take a moment to highlight some of the work that these organizations are doing to make this point really clear. Canada's non-profit and voluntary sector is the second largest in the world after the Netherlands. There are an estimated 161,000 non-profits and charities in Canada, and half of these are run entirely by volunteers. About 19,000 of those not-for-profits are incorporated under federal law. Two million people in Canada are employed by not-for-profits, making this sector one of the largest employers in Canada. The non-profit sector represents 7.8% of our GDP, which is larger than the auto and manufacturing sectors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271561">Legislative measures that seek to make it easier for these organizations to work are welcome. However, when looking at the proposals in Bill C-4, we have to ensure that any reforms help rather than hinder this vital sector. I have worked with a lot of non-profits in the past and when they have encountered problems with their governance structures, it hurts these organizations and can hurt them for years to come, but it can also devastate the local communities relying on those organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271562">Canadians can be proud about our place internationally. We have literally thousands of volunteers and workers running services in this country that we have all come to know well. The minister herself put it best when she was introducing this bill earlier in the week. She said:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271563">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> There is widespread recognition of the importance of strengthening Canada's not-for-profit sector, including the social purpose enterprises that form its backbone. These organizations are an important pillar of the economy as a whole. There are approximately 160,000 not-for-profit organizations operating in Canada. When universities, colleges and hospitals are included, the 2003 revenues of the sector were over $136 billion, up from $86 billion in 1997, a decade ago.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271564">I applaud the minister for pointing this out. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271565">However, when we take this bill to committee, we need to ensure that we consider this legislation with an eye to the diversity of non-profits across Canada. I applaud any attempt to respond to this sector's request to reform legislation, but let us ensure that we consider the impacts that any changes will have on any federally incorporated non-profit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271566">While we all share an appreciation of the work of these organizations, we would do well to remember that non-profit organizations are constantly faced with funding shortages. I hope that while we debate this bill, and this sector gains some attention in the House, that we keep funding top of mind. The bill, as presented, seeks to apply blunt regulatory reforms on all federally regulated non-profits. What is not present in the bill is accommodation for the diversity in both size and scope of the organizations in question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271567">While from a law-making standpoint a one-size-fits-all approach might seem a lot easier, it is not always in the best interests of the sectors affected. In consultations, representatives from the sector have outlined a number of regulatory concerns. This bill only deals with a narrow band of those issues. At the top of that list was securing long-term, stable financing, something that is not dealt with by Bill C-4. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1271568">Many parliamentarians have been members of boards and non-profits, whether federally or provincially incorporated. Therefore, I am sure the need for stability is clear to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271569">When non-profits can see that they will be funded consistently over a set number of years, their program can be more comprehensive and their financial planning can be less ad hoc and more accountable. This accountability is exactly what members of government have been pointing out as the major intention of Bill <Document DbId="3628831" Type="3">C-4</Document>. I am hopeful that this aspect will be considered appropriately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271570">It is worth pointing out that, whether it is an arts organization or a front line anti-poverty service provider, when funding is unpredictable or regulations are too complicated, they can put the work done in jeopardy. That in turn has a serious impact on the communities that are clients of the organization. In places like Halifax we cannot afford to have the work of these organizations hindered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271571">I would like to take the opportunity to pay tribute to some of these non-profit organizations that are doing great work in my riding and highlight the need for continued sustainable funding. The Ecology Action Centre has acted as a voice for Nova Scotia's environment for 35 years. In 1971 the EAC began working to build a healthier, more sustainable Nova Scotia. Today it has over a thousand members, 250 volunteers and staff, and 7 active teams and committees. Some of the amazing successes it has had included the launching of the first recycling program in Nova Scotia. Now Nova Scotia has a waste diversion rate higher than any industrialized nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271572">The EAC has also successfully advocated for the protection of 25,000 acres of wilderness since 2004. It initiated and now delivers the HRM by-law restrictions on the cosmetic use of pesticides, reducing restrictive pesticide permits by 80% since 2004.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271573">It has also created Nova Scotia's first working demonstration of a green office renovation and it recycled more than 125 pre-1995 cars through the steer clean program, thus helping to reduce air pollution by removing high polluting vehicles from the roads in Nova Scotia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271574">From the environment we move on to the issue of poverty. We have many amazing not-for-profit poverty organizations in the riding like Adsum for Women &amp; Children, a non-profit community based organization that has been active since 1983 in the entire Halifax region. Currently, there are three facilities run by Adsum. It operates Adsum House, which is an emergency shelter for women and children, and it has serviced about 12,000 women and their children since 1983. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271575">It also has Adsum Court which is a 24-unit apartment complex located in Dartmouth which is actually across the harbour from the Halifax riding. Adsum Court is a way to respond to the lack of safe and affordable housing in the community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271576">Finally, there is also Adsum Centre which is stage two supportive housing for women who are looking to achieve their personal independent living goals. I have done quite a bit of work with Adsum, with both the staff and the women at Adsum House and Adsum Centre. I have seen firsthand their amazing work which represents their values, that dignity, worth and potential of everyone is important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271577">We also have quite a few organizations working on the issue of housing, like the Metro Non-Profit Housing Association. Metro Non-Profit Housing Association assists single adults who have been homeless or are at risk of homelessness. It helps these adults create and maintain their homes. It does not just consider these homes a place to live. It wants it to be a place to call home so it strives to create housing units that are safe, secure and comfortable, a place where its tenants can feel at ease and feel at home. It actually supports the Shining Lights Choir, which is an amazing choir in Halifax made up of people who are homeless or who have experienced homelessness. It sings at quite a few different events and it is just an outstanding choir in the community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271578">Metro Non-Profit Housing Association actually talks about how some of its tenants have moved on to become entrepreneurs and some have even graduated from university. Another form of achievement, on move-in, about 65% of its tenants relied on social assistance but now only 25% because so many of its tenants have actually moved into the workforce once they achieved affordable, stable housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271579">We are also very strong in arts in Halifax. I will raise the non-profit Halifax Dance as an example. It is firmly dedicated to the development of dance and movement through arts, education, performance and community development in an environment that values the diversity and potential of all individuals. Halifax Dance is amazing. It logs its volunteer hours. It actually calculated that last year its volunteers logged in over 2,000 volunteer hours. This year is its 35th anniversary and it is very excited because on February 21 it is having a black tie event with a very special guest, Karen Kain.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1271580">If you have ever been to Halifax, Madam Speaker, and you have driven past our Citadel, you may have been stopped by a line of horses crossing the street right in downtown Halifax, and if you looked to your right you would have actually seen a set of stables. This the Halifax Junior Bengal Lancers and it was founded as a non-profit in 1936. It brought life and character to central Halifax through its stables and horseback riding arenas on Bell Road. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271581">This area has been designated a heritage site recently. While the facilities are home to 30 horses and about 100 children and adults who take part in the horseback riding programs, they are also an integral part to Halifax's prime tourist area which includes the public gardens and Citadel Hill. We are proud of the fact that we actually have horses coming along the streets in downtown Halifax. It is really something.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271582">Every fall in Halifax we also anxiously await the printing of one particular catalogue. This is a catalogue of movies featured in the upcoming Atlantic Film Festival. The festival is organized by the Atlantic Film Festival Association which is a not-for-profit organization. Members are committed to promoting and building a strong film industry in Atlantic Canada and presenting the best films from the region and from around the world to our local community. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271583">Under the umbrella of the non-profit association there are four main entities: the Atlantic Film Festival itself; Strategic Partners co-production conference; Viewfinders, which is an international film festival for youth and it is outstanding, if I do say so myself; and alFresco Film Festival, which is an outdoor film festival where movies are projected onto a large building at the waterfront. It is an extraordinary experience to sit by Halifax Harbour and watch movies outside under the light of the moon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271584">Some of the work that I have done in Nova Scotia with our non-profits has included work with NSRAP, the Nova Scotia Rainbow Action Project. This non-profit society was formed in 2000, and it strives to provide a coherent voice for gay, lesbian, bisexual, two-spirited, transsexual and transgender people, a group that it refers to as the rainbow community, throughout Nova Scotia. It is pan-Nova Scotian, but its main office is located in Halifax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271585">NSRAP, and its early iterations, has been working since 1995 throughout Nova Scotia as a voice for the rainbow community and its work is varied. It does political lobbying and legal work, and it does community building and research. It also tries to play a role as the public voice for the rainbow community in the media. I have had the opportunity to do quite a bit of work with its transgender committee, fighting for the rights of transgendered individuals in Nova Scotia and across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271586">We are also the proud home of a strong and proud Black Nova Scotian community in Halifax and many communities around Nova Scotia. Many non-profits have formed over time to support and promote African-Nova Scotian issues, history and culture. One such organization is the Black Educators Association which was founded in 1969 to assist African-Nova Scotian communities develop strategies toward an equitable education system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271587">Demonstrating a strong commitment as a grassroots organization, the BEA also coordinates its efforts with government departments, community groups, parent associations, school boards and other educational bodies. It has been involved in establishing many different projects and programs which include a bursary fund, regional educators program, advocates for black teachers, adult education and cultural academic enrichment programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271588">Some of our non-profit work in Halifax also focuses on theatre and great literary works like the non-profit organization Shakespeare by the Sea. It is actually like a dream that has become a reality. It provides accessible, informative, spicy, edgy, thought-provoking productions of the works of William Shakespeare. It was started in 1994 when a group of artists were invited to perform in Point Pleasant Park on a volunteer basis and with no publicity, just word of mouth, these performances attracted an audience of over 2,500 in just one weekend. So with resounding support from the community and excellent critical notices the Shakespeare by the Sea Theatre Society was incorporated in 1994. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1271589">Many of these performances are held in Point Pleasant Park, right on the banks of the harbour, but are also held on barges that float in the harbour. It has been really innovative in its performances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271590"> It has pioneered a walk-about theatre on the east coast, with landmark productions in the Martello Tower. It has done Martello Tower <I>Hamlet</I> and Martello Tower <I>MacBeth</I>. It did at Sandford Fleming Tower and <I>Henry V</I> and <I>King Lear</I> at the Halifax Citadel. It has been able to work with national landmarks in Halifax to showcase its performances. I have had the opportunity to see several of the performances over the years, and I applaud the work it does.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271591">The riding of Halifax is not just the city of Halifax. It includes many other communities, like Sambro or Ketch Harbour. It also includes a very large community called Spryfield, which is home to several non-profit organizations that do great work, like the Boys and Girls Club of Spryfield, which was started because of a need for more programs for children and youth in the Spryfield community. It is a non-profit community based organization. It provides social recreational and educational programming for children and youth. The programs are identified and brought forward by community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271592">Also in Spryfield is the Urban Farm Museum Society. This society works to celebrate and promote the agricultural heritage of the community, which is now like a suburb of Halifax. It promotes rural traditions in urban places. The society has established a working farm in Spryfield, right in urban Halifax. It continues the agricultural tradition of this area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271593">The farm operates on three acres of old Kidston family fields. Through a variety of interpretative programs, hands-on workshops, demonstrations and school programs, the society produces food, offers a teaching venue and promotes local foods that are in season. It also does things like clearing pastures, rejuvenating the orchard and reconstructing old farm buildings. It is quite a feat considering this farm is in downtown Halifax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271594">What do all of these organizations have in common? They all need funding. They work hand to mouth. Sometimes they get funding from the federal government, sometimes from the provincial government. They rely on donations. They are going from season to season to see if they can manage to cobble together some programs to meet the needs of the communities they are trying to serve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271595">The lack of commitment to stable funding for non-profit organizations applies whether these organizations are provincially or federally incorporated. Bill <Document DbId="3628831" Type="3">C-4</Document> does not address the issue of funding, but it is important to always have this in mind when we speak in the House and it is important to raise a discussion about sustainable funding for these organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271596">With regard to Bill <Document DbId="3628831" Type="3">C-4</Document>, the one-size-fits-all nature of the federal regulatory reforms could pose a significant problem for federally regulated non-profit organizations. Smaller organizations simply do not have the resources to comply with some of the reforms outlined. It is obvious that a smaller federally regulated organization cannot maintain membership lists in the same way a major organization like the United Way can.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271597">I would like to express my agreement that regulatory changes are needed for this sector. However, any discussion of changes must consider the lack of stable funding with which these groups are faced. I trust the bill will be thoroughly examined at committee and that we can pass a bill that will be in the best interest of this truly Canadian sector.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1271599">Does she not think that there is a great opportunity for the government to implement changes to the tax code that would allow Canada to have the same type of powerful foundations like they have in the United States, which are generators of money, not only for non-profit organizations but also larger initiatives in research and development? In fact, foundations in the U.S. allow substantial sums of money to move forward, for example, the Gates Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and others, that fund not only Canadians who do great work abroad but also other people from various countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271600">Does the hon. member believe that here is a missed opportunity for the government to do this, and that it should introduce elements within the bill to allow foundations to have the same type of structure and power that they have in the U.S.?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1271605">My question stems from my experience in working with non-profit organizations in my home area, specifically the Thompson Crisis Centre in Thompson, Manitoba. This is a women's shelter and it has gone above and beyond to provide some of the basic services that women's shelters struggle to offer. The centre is facing some real hardships in terms of possible cutbacks to federal programs, which assist in delivering child care services while women are being counselled. All of us recognize the need for child care in these types of centres if appropriate counsel is to be available for clients.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271606">The difficulty that non-profit organizations such as this one and others encounter is the need to advocate politically to address funding cutbacks and to fight so these cutbacks do not occur. There must be a recognition of the important voice these non-profit organizations must have. They need to point out the gaps and the need for government to step up in terms of its responsibility and support for the important work they do in our communities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1271609">Similarly, in the riding of Halifax, Spryfield lost its one and only licensed non-profit daycare, so there is very little child care in that community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271610">I have worked with a lot of women who are on welfare. Even though they had a job at one point, they went back on welfare because they could not afford to work and pay child care. At least if they collected welfare, their children were safe for the day. These women are desperate for work, and there is way too many of them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271611">Even though these organizations need more federal funding, or sometimes provincial funding, the problem is they are afraid to do advocacy work around these issues. There is a limited amount of advocacy work they can do under the Charities Act, but they are afraid of crossing the line. I have had organizations tell me they do not want to sign a letter to government saying that this is an important issue or that they need more funding for X and Y because then they might lose their charitable status.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1271615">There is a project in Vancouver run by the outstanding researcher Dr. Julio Montaner, who is now the president of the world HIV-Aids continuum and one of the best researchers in the world. The NAOMI project is a narcotics substitution project. It essentially gives people legal narcotics and disengages them from committing crimes, going out on the street, sharing needles and accessing heroin and other narcotics illegally. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271616">This project has allowed some of the toughest narcotic abusers in Vancouver to get back on their feet and to integrate and become a part of society.

              <ParaText id="1271617">Does my friend believe that projects like the NAOMI project, as part of a harm reduction strategy, should be widely available?

Should the government halt its legal attempt to block Insite, NAOMI and other harm reduction strategies that have proven to save lives, reduce harm and reduce cost to the taxpayer?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1271627">Madam Speaker, I was very impressed with the comments by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128555" Type="2">Halifax</Affiliation> in many areas. I was particularly taken by her comment that our non-profit groups across Canada are doing the work that government used to do, should be doing and recently has not been doing adequately. It is particularly important that we support our non-profits across Canada in every non-bureaucratic way that we can.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271628">The proposed Bill C-4 has a very narrow scope. It deals only with regulatory reform for non-profit corporations. Despite that, it manages to be incredibly lengthy. Reform is necessary. Better regulations are definitely needed, but not simply more. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271629">I have two problems with this bill. First, it does not deal with the important reforms that this sector has wanted. Second, I have problems with the way it carries out the changes it does deal with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271630">Regarding my first point, this bill does not address the major concerns of the non-profit sector. Through years of consultations, including the voluntary sector initiative and its government counterpart, groups in the sector have made it very clear that they want and need the following: clarification and improvements in the charitable status process, help to secure stable and long-term financing and help to address advocacy needs. It is unclear how this bill will help them in these areas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271631">In the voluntary sector initiative's final report, the need for support for financial accountability and reform for the sector is clear. They ask for assistance in identifying and developing tools for financial management. They ask for accountability and the assistance to gain skills in these areas. This bill fundamentally changes the financial accountability of the sector, but training and skills development do not seem to be a part of the government's plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271632">Non-profits have been clear that after years of reduced funding and less-secure funding, they need the means to conduct their businesses through social entrepreneurship in a more streamlined manner. Non-partisan political advocacy is currently ruled by what is commonly called the 10% rule, meaning that no more than 10% of any non-profit's efforts can go towards political advocacy. The sector remains concerned that this is an arbitrary number, difficult to measure and subject to abuse. The right of an organization to bear public witness on an issue that impacts their goals should not be marginalized.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271633">A healthy civil society depends on not-for-profits being allowed to address the issues that are fundamental to their existence in the first place and to educate the general public, the media and the government. Charitable tax status is a long and complicated process. There are complaints that this process can take months or even years longer than it is supposed to. It is a complicated process that leaves too much room for error, delay and perhaps abuse. This bill does nothing to ease that process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271634">Non-profits have been clear that they want and need tax relief for volunteers. According to Imagine Canada, as the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128555" Type="2">Halifax</Affiliation> has pointed out, the non-profit and volunteer sector is the second-largest per capita in the world, contributing over 7% to our gross domestic product. This sector has long been supported by some type of government tax incentive program. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271635">I know that Canada's voluntary sector was not hoping for a complicated legalization of <I>Robert's Rules of Order</I>. I am finding it hard to see how 170 pages of complex new regulations, replacing a few pages in part II of the current Canada Corporations Act, could make life much easier for our non-profits and the volunteers who often run them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271636">If the government would be willing to spend as much time dealing with issues important to the sector as it has on regulating it, we could have a stronger voluntary sector in Canada. We do not need restrictive and complicated regulations that will all but exclude lay people from starting or running charities and non-profits.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="10">(1410)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1271637">In Thunder Bay--Superior North, we have various groups. The Royal Canadian Legion is in Geraldton, Marathon, Nipigon and throughout the region. We have Environment North, northwestern Ontario's long-standing voice for the environment. We have the Canadian Mental Health Association. We have PACE, People Advocating for Change through Empowerment, in Thunder Bay. We have NOSA, the Northwestern Ontario Sportsmen's Alliance. These are the kinds of groups that need support, not hindrance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271638">The second group is found in some of the rules and loopholes that this bill sets down. After we had the do-not-call registry debacle, which is achieving the opposite of what was intended in that people on the list are receiving more telemarketer calls, not fewer, Canadians are right to be wary of any more government regulations that will make it easier for people or organizations to access our private information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271639">Subclause 23(2) of the proposed bill gives debt obligation holders of the non-profit organization or any member within it access to the entire membership list in one convenient package. This is very worrisome. Anyone could sign up as a member, sign a form and access the whole membership list of, for example, the Canadian Red Cross. Who knows where that information would go? Foreign individuals or groups engaged in these activities would be virtually impossible to prosecute. This issue of privacy violation should be scrutinized carefully.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271640">Regulatory reform would be a minor improvement for the non-profit sector, but it is not their main priority. Special attention must be paid to strengthening the privacy of member lists and minimizing the regulatory burden imposed on non-profits by this voluminous legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271641">I hope that our House members will pay due diligence to these concerns in committee.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1271642">Madam Speaker, I am very happy to have a few minutes to speak to the bill, because it has such a bearing, as members have heard, on all the communities we represent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271643">As members of Parliament, we work every day with the non-profit community and with the voluntary sector. We know how important volunteers are to the provision of services in our communities, and we know just how important it is to have a strong working relationship between the non-profit sector and government and parliamentary representation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271644">Many colleagues have heard how vital the non-profit sector is in our ridings, and my riding is no different. In fact, without the non-profit sector, very many vital services and commitments would not be fulfilled, because government is just not doing its job in some very key areas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271645">The contribution made to the economy by thousands and thousands of volunteers in this country has been mentioned over and over again. It has been estimated that the voluntary sector accounts for about 8% of GDP. We could imagine that the House should be gripped with the very notion of supporting the non-profit sector, and perhaps Bill <Document DbId="3628831" Type="3">C-4</Document> is one way of doing it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271646">However, I would question the priority of the government in proceeding with Bill <Document DbId="3628831" Type="3">C-4</Document> without looking at the very important relationship between the Government of Canada and the non-profit sector. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271647">Where is the relationship? What is the relationship? Where is the minister responsible? Where is the money set aside for building that relationship? Whatever happened to the 2001 accord, an accord between the Government of Canada and the voluntary sector? It was an accord that set out very clear requirements for government and the voluntary sector to build a relationship, to build a common approach to supporting the voluntary non-profit sector to nourish the values of cooperation, collaboration and transparency. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271648">Perhaps some parts of Bill <Document DbId="3628831" Type="3">C-4</Document> are very much in line with what the voluntary sector has requested, but I do not believe they expected this to be done in the absence of real support for the non-profit sector. I do not believe they thought they would be doing it on their own. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271649">We are in a time of economic crisis. All our communities are struggling at a time when the non-profit community is in deep trouble because people do not have the resources, the time or the energy to contribute to the non-profit and voluntary sector as they have in the past.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271650">We are at a critical moment. More than ever, we need the Government of Canada to work hand in hand with the voluntary sector, with the volunteers who slug it out, day in and day out, in their communities right across this country. They do not need rhetorical statements about support. They need real, substantive action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271651">At one time there was the beginning of a relationship between the non-profit sector and the Government of Canada. At one point, not too many years ago, a sum of $150 million was set aside for building that relationship, for ensuring that there was collaboration between all government departments and the non-profit sector, and my Liberal colleagues should remember it because they were part of the government at the time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271652">There was in fact the beginning of a system through which each department and each minister would have some capacity for reaching out and nurturing, nourishing and building the non-profit community. Where is that? Have we heard? Where is the money? Where is the commitment? Who is the minister responsible? Is there a minister responsible who believes in this? Is there a minister who actually gets it, in terms of the notions of cooperation and collaboration with the non-profit sector? Is there someone working there to ensure that we build capacity, that we support volunteer groups, that we encourage volunteerism in our society without leaving them high and dry?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271653">I think the opposite is happening. At the very time that our charitable sector is under pressure because people just do not have the same kind of money to make donations, the government is cutting back in all areas of the volunteer and non-profit sector, areas where they have made a huge difference in terms of helping people through the worst of times and the best of times.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="20">(1420)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1271654">All I need to do is look at the budget and know the impact of the government's direction on the non-profit voluntary sector. In the Department of Health alone, we are looking at departmental cutbacks of $42.7 million in this fiscal year, $52.9 million in the next year and $72.2 million after that. Where do we think that will come from? What will that mean in terms of support for the non-profit sector? What will that mean for services no longer provided by either the government or the non-profit sector?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271655">We have been through this before many times. We have seen the government attempt to slash, hack and burn the literacy program. With much pressure and support from community groups, the Conservatives put back some of that, but we have seen the pattern and we know what is likely to come unless we are vigilant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271656">We have seen it with the HIV-AIDS community and all of the prevention program cuts. We know that valued women's health programs are possibly on the chopping block and many other programs that work with communities in terms of providing vital services, linking up with government to ensure that government programs are delivered in the most effective way and in fact building capacity so that people become less and less reliant upon government in some instances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271657">I fear that this approach is tantamount to telling the non-profit sector that it is on its own, without the support of government. There is no real relationship between the government and the voluntary sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271658">Perhaps a member of the government could tell us where the 2001 accord is, which was the result of months and months of consultation between the government and the voluntary sector. We ended up with an accord that enunciated the vision of the voluntary sector and made a commitment between the two parties, the government and the non-profit sector, to work together to develop the framework for an ongoing partnership, a permanent relationship, and to put in place proper processes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271659">We are left with these questions. Where is the accord? Where is the money that helps build the relationship? Where is the minister responsible? Where is there a focus in every department for doing just this? How can we believe that Bill <Document DbId="3628831" Type="3">C-4</Document> will enhance and support the non-profit sector if we do not have any kind of indication from the government that it is prepared to put some money where its mouth is, especially at a time when it appears to be reaching deep into departmental spending lines and cutting where it hurts the most in terms of our voluntary, non-profit sector?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271660">We have seen time and time again examples of that. Every day that we deal with constituents, we know that groups are hamstrung by the fact that they are either being cut back or are trying to get charitable status but cannot because the government has some notion that the very notion of advocacy is political, that it is bad and that if we advocate for and work with our constituents to help them help themselves to build capacity, that is bad, wrong and no good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271661">In fact, that is one of the issues in the bill that needs to be addressed. How is it that even with the 10% rule in terms of advocacy, the government still continues to question groups that meet that 10% bar but are still accused of not doing strictly charitable work because it borders too much on helping people to speak up, advocating for others and working with communities so they cooperate on big projects in order to overcome some very deep-rooted systemic issues, whether we are talking about economic or social issues, or we are talking about the ability of a community to practise its traditions according to its heritage and with all the cultural celebration that is part of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271662">I have yet to hear in this debate any commitment from the government to the non-profit sector. Before we go any further with the bill, I would like to see the government come forward with a plan that tells us exactly what happened to the 2001 accord. Is it just gathering dust somewhere? Is there some plan to bring it forward, to rekindle the relationship between government and the non-profit sector, to restore some sense of confidence that in fact the government believes in people who have spent hours donating their time and their money but are faced with a government and a political climate where there is just not that faith or belief in the non-profit voluntary sector?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="25">(1425)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1271663">What is key is the sense from government that what volunteers do matters, that it matters when people use their free time, money and other resources to contribute to the life of a community, whether it is economic, social, cultural, educational or spiritual. We can address every one of those topics in the context of Bill <Document DbId="3628831" Type="3">C-4</Document> and yet we have not heard one word from the government on how it intends to instill the feeling in our communities that what they do matters, that they are part of the economy; 8% of the GDP. Can members imagine?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271664">At a time of economic crisis, when we want to stimulate and kick-start the economy, is it not important for community groups to have the necessary resources to provide the voluntary services that they are so good at, that saves government money in the long run, that has enormous spinoffs in terms of the creation of jobs and economic activity, in terms of purchase power and in terms of the feeling of confidence and self-worth where one can go out into the community and play a solid role and give back one's talents?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271665">I think it is awfully strange that, in this time of economic crisis, we do not have a government with a vision on this front. We need that vision. We do not just need a bill that says that we will put in place some rules to ensure there is tough transparency and regulation and to ensure everything is above board and there are no problems. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1271666">Ironically, we are talking about getting tough with the non-profit voluntary sector while the government sits back and does nothing about the excesses of the for-profit sector. Why is there no initiative on the part of the government like President Obama is doing in the United States to crack down on corporations and corporate CEOs' salaries and perks? Why are we not doing something that actually makes a difference in terms of sending a message to Canadians? Why are the profits of bank managers and CEOs so high at a time when they are refusing to pass on the savings to consumers that the government gives them through reduced interest rates? Why are we not starting to look at what is really fair in society today? What is fair is, in fact, to support the non-profit sector while cracking down on the excesses of the for-profit community.</ParaText>
