              <ParaText id="1764898">The bill would ensure that passengers are kept informed of flight changes, whether there are delays or cancellations. The new rules would be posted in airports and airlines would have to inform passengers of their rights and the process to file for compensation. The bill also deals with late and misplaced baggage. The bill would require that airlines provide all-inclusive pricing in their advertisements. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1764902">The petitioners say that legalized euthanasia speaks of a culture of death, of giving someone else the right to kill another and is not about compassion, dignity, love or care, but is deliberate killing. As Canadians we stand behind palliative care where intention is crucial, where pain is managed responsibly, and people are embraced and cared for with dignity.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1764905">The federal government has introduced legislation to legalize the activities of remailers, which would erode the revenue of the Canada Post Corporation needed to maintain its current universal service obligation. As our public post office plays a key role in our social and economic life by providing the infrastructure that healthy communities need to thrive and businesses need to grow, the petitioners call upon the Government of Canada to maintain the moratorium on post office closures and to withdraw the legislation to legalize remailers.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1764948">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to begin second reading of the provincial choice tax framework act. I will keep my comments short and as succinct as possible because we have heard time and time again how important this is to the provinces that they be allowed to make their choice as to how they collect their taxes. They are asking us to facilitate this as quickly as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1764949">As I have said in the House before, the provincial choice tax framework act is a very straightforward piece of legislation that simply confirms a fundamentally basic principle: provincial taxation is a provincial responsibility. As such, each province must have the independence to decide whatever form of taxation they deem best for their own jurisdiction's economy. The provincial choice tax framework act enshrines federal Parliament's belief that provincial taxation is indeed a matter of provincial autonomy. It facilitates maximum provincial choice on matters of provincial taxation, including the decision of a province to transition to harmonized value-added tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1764950">As a point of overview, I remind members that in the past provinces in Canada have been allowed the autonomy to adopt the model of provincial taxation they so desire. That has meant that various provinces in Canada have been permitted without restriction to adopt varied models including in relation to their sales tax. At present five have sales tax, four provinces have a value-added tax or a variation of a value-added tax and one province has neither. The key point to emphasize here is that each province has had complete autonomy in this decision, free of federal restriction, to implement the model they consider most appropriate for their economy: a sales tax, a value-added tax, or neither. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1764951">As I have mentioned previously in this chamber, our government fully supports provincial autonomy in matters of provincial taxation. What is more, we strongly believe provinces should all be treated in the same way with respect to making such a choice. Put another way, each province should have the same rights as other provinces when making choices regarding provincial taxation, including the ability to freely adopt a harmonized value-added tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1764952">A little over a decade ago, under the administration of the then Liberal government, I remind this chamber that we saw this concept in action. Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador each made the decision to transform their model of provincial taxation. Accordingly, the then federal Liberal government facilitated those provincial decisions to harmonize their new value-added taxes with the federal value-added tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1764953">I note the newly elected NDP government in Nova Scotia has not publicly denounced or sought to repeal the province's harmonized value-added tax since forming government. We believe and have stated so consistently, since forming government in 2006, that the exact same treatment should be equally afforded to all provinces. Indeed, the provincial choice tax framework act will ensure that going forward all provinces will have that ability and have the freedom to make decisions on matters of provincial taxation with greater certainty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1764954">As we are all well aware, two provinces have recently declared their intention to alter their model of provincial taxation. First, on March 26, 2009, the province of Ontario, through its minister of finance, Dwight Duncan, announced the following and I will quote at length to provide the full context of this provincial decision for the benefit of our colleagues in this House:</ParaText>

The provincial choice tax framework act will ensure that, through amendments to the Excise Tax Act, the transition to a harmonized value-added tax for provinces that choose such a course of action is done in an equal and consistent manner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1764988">This technical tax legislation will enshrine a provincial choice tax framework that will be equally available to all provinces. The provincial choice tax framework act specifically includes: first, the imposition of the provincial component of the harmonized value-added tax in respect of that province; second, the application of any element of provincial tax policy flexibilities, including rate flexibility for the provincial component of the harmonized value-added tax; and finally, the proper administration and enforcement of and compliance with the act.</ParaText>

That estimate comes from the Parliamentary research service. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1765007">The first has to do with the memorandum of agreement with the Province of Ontario. Near the end of the agreement there is reference to the appointment of a panel that would be put together to deal with potential changes. One of those is a potential change to the revenue allocation framework, such as replacement by a system that would provide distribution of revenue based on actual sales of goods and services.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1765009">The second question has to do with the question of the haste with which this bill has been dealt with. The <Affiliation DbId="128843" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> will know that the Province of Ontario has announced that, as part of its implementation of a harmonized tax, it wants to pass its legislation by Christmas so it can implement a personal income tax cut by January 1.

              <ParaText id="1765012">January 1 is the date. We are fast approaching that date and it is important that we move forward with this.

We are following through on that same formula.</ParaText>

It is not about taking the initiative as much as allowing them that prerogative within their own jurisdiction. I think the member could probably speak to us, having had business interests over the years, about what happens in business when there is uncertainty out there. Certainly, in respect to this, when there is uncertainty about a harmonized value added tax, there is an unfairness to business and provincial governments and their employees that is harmful to jobs and unhelpful to Canada's international competitiveness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765016">One way or other, this needs to be clarified. That is the nature of the framework. Our government likes to be consistent with respect to equalization and harmonization so there is consistency and not these one-offs with provinces along the way. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1765032">Mr. Speaker, I can be relatively brief and concise today because I think we have gone through these matters a number of times and the situation is really very simple, that is to say, it is a matter of provincial jurisdiction. I could just sit down at this point because it is that simple, but I will speak for a little bit longer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765033">The bill creates the framework for Ontario and B.C. to harmonize their provincial sales taxes with the GST. Beyond that it will create a framework for any other provinces that wish to harmonize their taxes to do so as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765034">There is a simple principle contained in the bill, the idea that provinces have the right to choose how they tax their citizens. Specifically, the bill creates a framework for Ontario and B.C. to harmonize their provincial sales taxes with the GST, as they have chosen to do. I do not understand why this simple point is so difficult for the NDP to understand.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1765035">This is within provincial jurisdiction. It is up to the provinces to decide how they will tax. This is not about whether or not we like the tax; it is a matter of provincial jurisdictions.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1765036">It will also create a framework for any other provinces that choose to harmonize their sales tax to do so. As we know, several Canadian provinces have already harmonized their sales tax with that of the federal government, and none of these provinces that have harmonized have ever chosen to reverse their course and de-harmonize the tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765037"> Nova Scotia chose to harmonize its sales tax, and the federal government allowed it to do so. At the time, the provincial NDP Party vowed that if it were ever elected to government, it would scrap the HST. Believe it or not today the NDP is the governing party in Nova Scotia, and I have not heard NDP Premier Darrell Dexter indicate in any way that his government will de-harmonize its HST. In fact, the Nova Scotia NDP wants to retain Nova Scotia's harmonized sales tax. That is the choice of the Nova Scotia NDP government and we, as federal politicians, should respect the provincial NDP's choice in this area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765038">This year, as we know, Ontario and British Columbia have indicated their intention to harmonize their respective sales taxes, just as other provincial governments had done during the 1990s.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765039">Today it falls to us, as federal legislators, to decide if we will allow Ontario and British Columbia to harmonize their taxes, the same way that past Parliaments have allowed other provinces to do so. I am talking about provinces like New Brunswick where a Liberal government currently maintains an HST, like Newfoundland and Labrador where a Conservative government maintains an HST, and like Nova Scotia where an NDP government maintains an HST.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765040">The 35th Parliament allowed these provinces to harmonize when they asked to do so. Should we, today, change course and tell other provinces that might wish to follow their lead that it is too late? Should we tell them that they cannot have an HST if they want one?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765041">I would say the obvious answer to that question is no. We must allow them to make their own decisions, and that is why I will be supporting this legislation that allows these provinces, and other provinces in the future, to make a choice regarding what is fundamentally a matter that is inside their own jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765042">Let me give a very brief description of what this bill does. The bill will add B.C. and Ontario, the two provinces that are seeking to harmonize taxes, to schedule VIII of the Excise Tax Act and will set B.C.'s portion of the HST at a rate of 7% and Ontario's at 8%. It is important to note that this is a fundamental shift from the 1990s vision of a single rate across the country, which assumed that all provinces would share an identical rate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765043">One important shortcoming of this legislation is that first nations in Ontario will be denied the tax exemption they currently enjoy. I have written to the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> on this topic, and I have asked him to negotiate a fairer arrangement with the Government of Ontario on this matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765044">It is also important to note that some input tax credits will initially be denied under this bill. This denial will apply to large businesses with over $100 million in sales. The input tax credit denials will be phased out over the next five years as the HST becomes a full value-added tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765045">To those Canadians who are on the opposition's side of the HST, it should be abundantly obvious that the federal Conservatives have their fingerprints all over this legislation. It was the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> who encouraged Ontario and British Columbia to harmonize their sales tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765046">It was the federal Conservatives who noticed that the two provinces were both facing deficits due to this Canada-wide Conservative recession and who offered them billions of dollars to make the tax change. If they had not done so, perhaps Ontario and B.C. would not have decided to harmonize.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765047"> That possibility is of course strictly hypothetical, because the hard reality is that both Ontario and B.C. have in fact decided to harmonize their sales taxes and regardless of their reasons have struck and signed deals with the federal government. That is why, as I said earlier, this legislation is about whether Ottawa feels that provinces have the right to determine how they tax within their own areas of jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765048">I appreciate that some in this House may not like the HST, but I would suggest that if they want to begin prohibiting provinces from working in areas of their own jurisdiction, they should resign from this House and they should run for their provincial legislatures. Otherwise, they should support this bill and its very simple principle that should not be beyond the NDP's capacity to understand, that principle being that provinces have a right to decide whether or not to have a harmonized sales tax.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1765087">Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by stating that Bloc Québécois members support Bill <Document DbId="4268485" Type="3">C-62</Document>, which is before us today. Yesterday, some people were wondering whether we opposed the time allocation motion for this bill, given that we did not even see the bill until after the motion was moved. That was completely unacceptable. But now that the motion has been adopted, we agree with the House's decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765088">We support this bill, but not for the same reasons as other members, be they Conservative or Liberal. We respect Ontario and British Columbia's decision to harmonize their provincial sales taxes with the GST, because that is what Quebec has been doing for many years now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765089">We would like to reiterate the request made by Quebec's National Assembly last spring in a unanimous resolution: Quebec must receive fair compensation for having harmonized its sales tax with the federal tax beginning in 1992.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765090">The Bloc Québécois is calling for fair and equal treatment for Quebec in all matters. The federal government changed the rules of the harmonization game. When it compensated the maritime provinces—New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nova Scotia—it said that Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec would not be eligible for compensation because they stood to lose less than 5% of their tax revenue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765091">As we have seen, the federal government changed the rules for Ontario and British Columbia. Its latest budget included funds for compensating those two provinces. The Government of Quebec, naturally, passed a unanimous resolution telling the federal government that it makes no sense to change the rules and that it must take into account what Quebec has done in previous years. I will come back to that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765092">We intend to continue putting pressure on the federal government to resolve this contentious issue that has been around for many years. This is a matter of equality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765093">I want to put this into context. We know that the Government of Quebec harmonized its sales tax with the federal tax in the early 1990s. At that time, the federal government agreed to allow Quebec to manage the GST within its own jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765094">In 1997, the federal government offered compensation to three provinces—New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nova Scotia—to harmonize their sales taxes with the federal tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765095">Unlike the situation in Quebec, the federal government would manage the federal part as well as the provincial part of the new harmonized tax. As compensation for the loss of revenue caused by harmonization, the federal government paid nearly $1 billion to those three provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765096">Since then, the Government of Quebec has been asking Ottawa for compensation for harmonizing its sales taxes, which it had done five years earlier. However, even though it recognized the Government of Quebec's full harmonization of sales taxes, the federal government refused to compensate Quebec, claiming that the Quebec government's loss of revenue caused by the harmonization was not enough to justify such compensation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765097">At that time, in order to receive compensation, the loss of revenue caused by the harmonization of the provincial portion of the sales tax had to exceed 5% of the total amount of the provincial tax. At the same time, the federal government said that Ontario and British Columbia were not entitled to this compensation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="05">(1105)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1765098">But the government is now going back on its word on this lost revenue rule and it has reached an agreement with Ontario and British Columbia. This agreement included significant compensation, to the tune of $4.3 billion for Ontario and $1.6 billion for British Columbia. One might say that, by rejecting the 5% criterion, the federal government has now opened the door for Quebec to qualify for compensation. The rules of the game have been changed for two provinces, so why not change them for Quebec as well and ensure that it, too, is eligible for compensation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765099">Instead of naturally and fairly compensating Quebec for having harmonized its tax five years earlier, in other words in 1992—or 17 years ago now—the Conservatives, using their legendary bad faith, have started coming up with new excuses not to give Quebec the $2.6 billion it is owed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765100">In response to their claim, which surprised Quebec's finance minister, Ms. Jérôme-Forget, that the Government of Quebec had not in fact completely harmonized its sales tax with the federal government, Quebec committed to doing one thing right away. There were certain inputs for big companies that were still not exempt from QST. The finance minister announced that the Government of Quebec would proceed with those adjustments. Then, and we heard it here in this House, the Conservatives found new reasons not to compensate Quebec. They said that Quebec should stop charging tax on tax. Through its finance minister, the Government of Quebec promised to so do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765101">What did the federal government do? It came up with another excuse. From now on, only provinces whose federal and provincial sales taxes are collected by the federal government will be compensated. An agreement was made in 1992 whereby the Government of Quebec would collect the tax on behalf of the federal government. This is just another fine example of the predatory federalism practised by the Conservative government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765102">As I said earlier, when the two sales taxes were harmonized in 1991, the Government of Quebec entered into an agreement with the federal government whereby the Government of Quebec would collect the tax on behalf of both governments and then pay Ottawa its share. For Quebec, it was and still is a question of autonomy. In exchange, the federal government would pay Quebec $130 million annually. This was not compensation, but payment for services rendered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765103">The Bloc Québécois respects the decision by Ontario and British Columbia to have the federal government collect their sales taxes. That is their choice and their business. But the Bloc Québécois will support the Government of Quebec in its fight against the federal government, which is trying to take away Quebec's power to collect the GST in Quebec on Ottawa's behalf.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765104">Those are the main reasons why, although we are in favour of the bill, we are still certain that until this dispute between Quebec City and Ottawa is resolved, there will still be an injustice. We are going to work hard to put an end to this injustice and ensure that the federal government provides Quebec with compensation pro-rated to its population and the amount of sales tax collected in Quebec, as it is planning to do for Ontario and British Columbia. Quebec must be compensated fairly for what it has been doing for many years under the sales tax harmonization agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765105">In closing, I would like to say that we will certainly not let this dispute continue. We are not going to let the current government keep on acting unfairly and denying what the Government of Quebec has already done to harmonize its sales tax and even make adjustments. When adjustments have been needed, they have been made quickly.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1765106">We are certain that, because of this bill, the provinces will be somewhat more able to create or enter into agreements with the federal government more easily. That is the upside of this bill and that is why we will vote for it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1765111">Mr. Speaker, I would like to reassure the member that absolutely no deal or agreement has been made between the Conservative government and the Bloc Québécois. I will repeat what I just said. The Bloc Québécois is in favour of this bill because it updates the act that serves as the framework for the 1997 memorandum of agreement between the maritime provinces and the federal government. The protocol and the framework legislation were much more rigid.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765112">We now have before us a situation where it is clear that the federal government is agreeing to compensate two provinces, Ontario and British Columbia, by removing the criterion of a loss of revenue of less than 5%, a criterion that Quebec did not meet. British Columbia and Ontario did not meet this criterion either.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765113">We certainly believe that removing this criterion and modernizing the legislation will make it easier to reach an eventual agreement. We hope that Quebec and the federal government will reach an agreement as quickly as possible. However, there is no agreement in place and there is no guarantee that it will happen. The Bloc Québécois will continue to fight this battle in this House, in keeping with the unanimous resolution adopted by Quebec's National Assembly in February 2009.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1765114">Mr. Speaker, another colleague of the member from the Bloc spoke yesterday about the compensation situation with Quebec, and she laid out a couple of aspects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765115">The first was that the harmonization taxation was not fully implemented, or that there were still other areas in which harmonization could take place. The other was that Government of Quebec, unlike other provinces, collected all the taxes and remitted to the Government of Canada its share as opposed to the reverse, which is the arrangement with the other provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765116">I do not know what impact those differences may have on the overall bill, but it would appear that the memorandum of understanding with the province of Ontario is unique, as is the understanding and the arranged agreement with B.C. Both of those are even different from the agreements that were reached with the three maritime provinces that harmonized some time ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765117">Could the member clarify what changes Quebec would have to make to the harmonization regime and framework that it implemented and how that might impact any requests for a renegotiation of the settlement, or the inducement to have a harmonized tax?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1765118">Mr. Speaker, I would like to clarify that most of the differences he is talking about regarding the way that the Quebec sales tax and the GST were harmonized have been resolved. There are just a few very minor points that remain, and they are not significant enough to justify the fact that the federal government refuses to compensate the Government of Quebec. It is very clear that changes have been made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765119">The main difference is that Quebec currently collects the federal tax and is paid $130 million by the federal government to do so. That is not an obstacle. It is the result of an agreement signed in 1992.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765120">The $2.6 billion in compensation has nothing to do with the fact that the Government of Quebec collects all of the taxes within Quebec. The compensation is to compensate—as the word says—a government that has already harmonized its tax or that plans to do so for the revenue losses it will incur. The Government of Quebec has been losing revenue since 1992, since it harmonized its tax. It makes sense for the federal government to compensate Quebec, as it does for the other provinces.</ParaText>

The bill updates the framework, based on the assessments that have been done. Of course, this paves the way for harmonization and compensation for Ontario and British Columbia, but it also opens to the door to compensation for all provinces that decide to harmonize their sales tax or have already done so. That is very clear.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1765123">Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to speak again in opposition to what is essentially an 8% ripoff for Ontarians and the people in British Columbia. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765124">If the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the McGuinty Liberals have their way, a haircut next summer would cost 8% more. Burying a loved one would cost 8% more. Vitamins, a pair of sneakers, postage stamps, vet fees for a dog and an oil change for a car would all cost 8% more. Even the price of gas would go up. That would hurt a lot of families, seniors, young people and small businesses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765125">From the outset, the NDP said that the HST was the wrong tax at the wrong time. The recession is still being felt, unemployment is still rising and this regressive tax will take $2.5 billion out of the pockets of those who are least able to afford it. To add insult to injury, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> will give Premier Dalton McGuinty $4.3 billion in exchange for his agreements to tax Ontarians more. B.C., which will also get the HST, is being paid too. Therefore, I can understand why Quebec, which has already harmonized its sales taxes, will want compensation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765126">These payouts are all money that drives Canada further into debt, and for which the government has not budgeted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765127"> At the same time, big companies will win the jackpot yet again with another $1.5 billion in corporate tax cuts and, as McGuinty and the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> boast, the HST will cut business input costs even further. In other words, the HST will drive up taxes for families and lower them for big business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765128">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and McGuinty say that we need to look at the bigger picture. Okay, let us do that. Here is what we see. This recession was caused, not by high wages or a lack of initiative on the part of working Canadians. It was caused by a carnival of greed among bankers, financiers and others who took reckless risks and triggered a worldwide financial crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765129"> Yet seniors and hard-working families are the ones taking it in the neck. Pension funds are in difficulties. Retirement savings tucked away in RRSPs have lost much of their value. From next summer onward, big business would pay less and ordinary Canadians would pay more for everything from Internet services to gasoline. That is hardly fair. That is why we are currently locked into battle in the House of Commons to block the legislation that will allow the federal government to foist the HST on Ontarians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765130">Under the leadership of the member for <Affiliation DbId="128315" Type="2">Etobicoke—Lakeshore</Affiliation>, the Liberal Party has sided with the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who has launched an underhanded gambit to ram through the House before the holiday break. It is his way of saying, “Merry Christmas”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765131">There will be no consultations on the HST law, no committee hearings, no opportunity for Canadians to have their say. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> does not want to hear from retiree groups, real estate associations, minor hockey organizations, provincial premiers and many others who have declared their opposition. He wants us out of the way as quickly as possible. He wants to hang this tax on Premier McGuinty. He wants us to get used to this tax grab so we will not blame him forward to the next election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765132"> We will not let the Conservatives take the blame because we know that this is the wrong tax in the wrong hands at the wrong time, and the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> knows it too.

Business cheques are cheap and I don't mind signing eight instead of four. What I do mind is investing more of my working capital into a never ending loop of payables and receivables, that I will never gain back these moneys 100% unless I liquidate my inventory and close up shop. As an Importer, I will have to pull the full 13% from my pocket when I customs clear my orders instead of the current 5% GST. I don't know how I'm supposed to benefit from laying out an extra 8% up front and waiting to recoup that money on receivables later. I am a very proud Canadian, but things like this shave a bit off the top of that pride every time it is forced down our throats by those who are elected by us and draw a salary from our hard work.

This is doubly true in a recession where less than 50% of the unemployed qualify for EI, where social assistance rates are well below the poverty line, and the cost of essentials loom all the larger.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765180">Second, the HST extends the sales tax to essentials previously not covered by the PST, and apart from those items exempted, and those differ from province to province, those with the lowest income have no choice but to pay it and sacrifice consumption elsewhere. The HST is hitting those who can least afford it harder than anyone else. The tax, quite simply, is unfair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765181">Third, without significant compensating measures, like the GST tax rebate, or significant exemptions of essential goods and services for low and moderate income families, the tax remains unfair. Our experience with social support programs does not reassure us. Governments that have demonstrated a callous disregard for the plight of low and moderate income households cannot be trusted to apply the HST fairly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765182">Fourth, the suggestion that the HST will lead to significant increases in investment is unproven. Economist Erin Weir has pointed out that a significant proportion of business inputs in Ontario are already exempted from the PST, therefore removing the remaining tax on inputs will not have the impact that the government claims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765183">Fifth, if as is argued a sales tax is bad for investment compared to the tax on profits, then why is the removal of sales taxes from inputs not matched by an increase in corporate income taxes? In fact, the opposite is true. The HST is accompanied by corporate income tax cuts at both the federal and provincial levels. In other words, the HST is part of a general and indiscriminate shift in tax burden from the corporations to individuals and families without adequate compensation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765184">Sixth, progressive economists argue that if we want to use the tax system to encourage investment, across-the-board cuts are an inefficient way to proceed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765185">Seventh, with the economy operating at two-thirds capacity, increasing profits by lowering taxes through the HST is not as likely to foster new investment as it might when the economy is booming. The timing of this tax, again, is inappropriate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765186">Last, as for lowering prices, this assumes businesses will pass along their savings to consumers. If this happens, it will happen only in competitive industries. Studies show much less than 100% of the savings are passed on to consumers. In other words, price increases are virtually inevitable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765187">In conclusion, let me repeat, this is the wrong tax in the wrong hands at the wrong time. It continues the pattern under successive federal Conservative and Liberal governments of pursuing policies that boost the returns to a privileged corporate elite on the flimsy excuse that they will use those returns to benefit the rest of us. Three decades of growing income inequality in this country prove those promises false.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1765188">Mr. Speaker, the member has covered a lot of ground. It is always interesting to hear what constituents have to say about things when they are only told part of the story.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765189">At the end of her speech the member mentioned the fact that there will be tax credits or input tax credits to businesses because there will not be the cascading of the provincial tax that currently exists, which means that the cost of business expenses will go down, but they will not be passed on unless there is a competitive environment. That is probably true. That is a very important point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765190">She quoted from an email saying, “Is anyone honest anymore?” I kind of hearken back to the very first thing she said which was that the price of a haircut was going up 8%. Period. Full Stop. However, throughout her speech she did not mention that as part of the agreement between the Conservative government and the province of Ontario, there are permanent income tax cuts of 16.5%, there is a one-time $1,000 credit, and there will also be a new sales tax credit, just as Canadians receive now with the GST sales tax credit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765191">So there are offsets. It is pretty easy to list the number of goods and services, particularly the services, that will in fact attract a new tax to make the whole system simpler, but the offset to that is to give real, permanent income tax decreases to the residents of Ontario at the same time, and those tax cuts are proposed to be effective January 1, 2010 whereas the HST is not intended to be implemented until July 1, 2010.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1765225">Mr. Speaker, how could anyone be against a bill that allows the provinces to harmonize taxes that affect everyone? We must ask ourselves this question. In Quebec, we do not understand how anyone could oppose it, since we harmonized our taxes in 1992. At that time, we thought it was only right that we should take over the management of our own affairs. It was only natural for us to govern in a different way. Business was business at that time, and accordingly, for services rendered, the Government of Canada reimbursed the Government of Quebec $130 million a year for administrative costs. It is an administrative arrangement: the federal government has what it has for $130 million. This has nothing to do with compensation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765226">At the time, the Government of Canada did not offer any compensation. As least that is what it said, until it offered three provinces—New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland—compensation equivalent to 1.5 percentage points of the tax base. That is how those three maritime provinces received nearly $1 billion, $961 million to be exact, beginning in April 1996, to be paid over four years, thereby compensating for 100% of the difference for the first two years, 50% for the third year, and 25% for the fourth year. No matter what administrative arrangements were made, there were arrangements and there was compensation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765227">It is up to the provinces to decide whether to let the Government of Canada collect the tax. I see this as yet another difference between Quebec and the Canadian provinces. Quebeckers would rather we control our own tax revenue ourselves. That is one of our rights, one of the rights we have claimed, one of the rights we exercise, and nobody is going to come and take that away from us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765228">However, since 1996, Canada's tax system has been blatantly unfair. The maritime provinces were compensated, but Quebec was not. Of course, there are those who say that since 1995, the federal government has been allowed to do whatever it wants to Quebec. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765229">The value-added tax system is a much better system that Quebec has favoured for ages. This is another example of what a great job Quebec is doing running its own affairs. It is doing such a great job that Canada's two largest provincial economies have now accepted that this is the best way to do things and are working on harmonizing their taxes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765230">And now, in one fell swoop, the Government of Canada wants to be in charge of collecting these taxes for free on top of providing compensation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765231">Compensation for these two provinces is more than peanuts. It will be around $4.3 billion for Ontario and $1.6 billion for British Columbia, a total of $5.9 billion in current 2009 dollars. Those two provinces will cash in, but Quebec will still get nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765232">This morning, one of the speakers estimated that the $5.9 billion will actually end up costing a little over $10 billion because of the interest that the Government of Canada will have to pay on the money it borrows to pay that $5.9 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765233">I did the opposite calculation and came up with some numbers of my own. If the government has owed Quebec $2.6 billion since 1992, what would that be worth today? How much? At an interest rate of 5% over 17 years—I did this properly using a 5% interest rate, not 10%—the current value of the $2.6 billion owing to Quebec since 1992 would be $6 billion. Now, $6 billion compared to $5.9 billion, that is saying something.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1765234">In other words, what the federal government will be giving Ontario and British Columbia is equivalent, in today's dollars, to what has been owed to Quebec since 1992. It could not be more unfair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765235">But we have no intention of interfering in the negotiations between the federal government and the Government of Quebec regarding the compensation. They have the power to negotiate and we will let them do so. But in order to negotiate, you need at least two parties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765236">One has to wonder about the willingness of the federal government to negotiate with Quebec. Despite a unanimous motion from the Quebec National Assembly, we have not gotten anything.

              <ParaText id="1765247">Some provisions do leave me confused, though, such as the advance notice required for changes in provincial value-added tax rates. From now on, the provinces will have to notify the federal government 120 days before making any changes. This means that a provincial finance minister will no longer be able to announce in a budget speech that effective at midnight, the tax rate will go down or up by a given percentage. I am getting into administrative details, but the fact remains that the substance of the bill is good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765248">The bill offers less flexibility and is sort of a Canadian compromise.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1765261">The member noted some of the independent research that I had requested which was done by the economists at the Library of Parliament. They reviewed the $5.9 billion that is going to be borrowed to bring in this tax in Ontario and B.C. They projected it over 10 years and applied the general borrowing rate of the Government of Canada over the last 10 years. The cost increases from $5.9 billion to $9.9 billion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765262"> I am wondering why the Bloc is supporting this bill along with the Liberals and the Conservatives, given the history of how Quebec has been treated. It is giving up a negotiation tactic here by allowing this to go forward without that issue being addressed. I would like to know from the member what the Bloc's strategy is in terms of caving into this right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765263">If the Bloc members actually were supportive of pushing this issue for fairness in Quebec, they would not give the government and the Liberals this easy out, especially over the holiday season, to close down debate this way and to limit committee hearings. If there were committee hearings, witnesses from Quebec could give testimony about what happened in the past and what should happen. They could make that argument, but the Bloc members are giving all that up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765264">On top of that, Quebec residents are going to have to contribute to that $9.9 billion because the money is going to come from all across Canada. They are also going to owe the $5.9 billion and the interest on that. That is going to be passed on to Quebeckers as well.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1765265">Madam Speaker, indeed, the Government of Canada, instead of the provinces, will have to borrow. Consequently, in terms of overall debt management, the result is the same: if one does not borrow, the other will. Quebec has been waiting for the $2.6 billion for 17 years. That should not drag on just because there is unfairness on one side.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765266">My colleague's question reminded me of something my mother taught me when I was a child. She used to say that being treated unfairly by someone did not give me the right to treat others unfairly. That is my position today. I am saying, and with justification, that Quebec is being treated unfairly by the federal government when it comes to tax harmonization, especially with regard to sales taxes. However, that is no reason to treat everyone unfairly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765267">In my opinion, the bill opens the door to future compensation from the Government of Canada. Ultimately, Quebec's concern is collecting what we have been owed since 1992 and, eventually, all the rest.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1765278">I suppose I could ask the same thing not only of the members from Quebec that are ministers in the Conservative government, but also of the other members because, although they are not many, there are Conservative Party MPs that are not ministers.

              <ParaText id="1765285">Madam Speaker, if someone were to tell someone else on the street that there would be an 8% increase in the cost of a number of services not currently charged any tax, and then took a survey of all of those people, asking them if that were a good idea or how they felt about it, I can only assume that most of the people would say that they really did not want to pay any more tax on something, if it is not taxed already. That, indeed, has been the basis of the argument a number of people have made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765286">Interestingly enough, the conversations that members have had and the discussions and debate have been about income tax issues in the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia at this time. The conversations are not with regard to Bill <Document DbId="4268485" Type="3">C-62</Document> specifically, the bill we are presently debating. It is the nature of this place that if a person can make a link to an issue, they can talk about pretty well whatever they want, because politically it may be more advantageous for them to say some things, but not everything. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765287">That is unfortunate, because the constituents I have heard are not exactly sure what is happening and who is in charge of what. So I thought I would try to explain this to them, because most of us have received a lot of emails from people about a harmonized sales tax, and they are not exactly sure what all of the details are, because the bills that will lay out all of the details have not even been presented yet in the Province of Ontario or the Province of B.C. There are some preliminary pieces of information on the websites of those provinces, which their residents can look at.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765288">The Conservative Government of Canada has entered into agreements with the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia to harmonize the federal and provincial taxes into one tax called an HST. Three other provinces have already done it. The fourth province, Quebec, has done a sort of harmonization; it is not complete and, indeed, there are still discussions going on about whether or not Quebec may be entitled to further compensation for having entered into a quasi-harmonization agreement. Now two provinces want to enter into such an agreement as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765289">We have to ask ourselves, why would provinces want to do that? Why would they want to harmonize their taxes, knowing that the issue of taxation is not politically popular? They do not do it because they want to somehow agitate people. There must be a reason. Having done enough research and having looked at the economic analyses and to some of the people who have been involved historically in dealing with consumer taxes like GST or PST, the consensus among the analysts I have looked to, the people who appear regularly before the finance committee and, indeed, some other committees, has been that the provincial sales tax system is a very inefficient system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765290">It is inefficient because provincial sales tax is charged at each stage of the life of producing a product. That means when someone gets the raw materials, for instance, cutting down a tree, that business of cutting down trees and sending trees to the lumber mill is charged provincial sales tax. The lumber mill will have some other expenses and it will process and produce the trees into two by fours and other building materials. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="15">(1215)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1765291">Those are sold to wholesalers and there is a provincial tax added to them, the same provincial tax. Now the product has been hit three times along the way. Ultimately, it goes from there to where the individual consumer can purchase the wood needed for the project, which is again charged. The provincial sales tax has been charged more than once. It is charged all the way along the line. It is tax on tax on tax. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765292">In fact, if we were to look at the analysis of the final selling price of a product that people purchase in the province of Ontario, we would find, notwithstanding that the provincial sales tax rate is currently 8% in Ontario, that the amount of provincial sales tax in the ultimate price we pay is far greater than that, because it has been applied several times and compounds. There is an enormous amount of tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765293">Could anyone imagine if that provincial sales tax were treated the same way the GST is treated? The GST is only paid by the end consumer. It is charged at the first point of production, for instance, in the example that I used, but when the product is sold to the next person down the line, maybe the lumber mill, the seller gets back the taxes paid. The seller has just passed on the 7% and it keeps building up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765294"> However, at the end of the day, the total amount of GST charged on the same product is currently 5%. That is the total amount that people would see in the final purchase price of that product compared with something now that is far in excess of the current provincial rate, simply because there are no input tax credits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765295">Most of the members here are very familiar with that, particularly the member for <Affiliation DbId="128220" Type="2">Hamilton Mountain</Affiliation>. She is on the finance committee and we talk about a lot of these things. She and I know the mechanics of the system and know very well that if efficiencies in the tax system save businesses money, these are is not going to help the consumer very much if the businesses decide to hoard the money and keep it themselves rather than passing it on to consumers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765296">The only way to address that is to have a competitive economy. There has to be enough competition within the system so that if a competitor is going to pass on more or all of the savings from changes in tax policy, another competing business has no choice but to match those or else lose business to the competitor simply because of the economies of lower pricing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765297">Therefore, it does make some sense to make the provincial system more efficient and fairer, in fact. We are overtaxed at the provincial level. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765298">However, why now? Many of the members have raised the issue of it being good policy but bad timing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765299">I do not think anybody is going to dispute the fact that the Province of Ontario is in some very serious difficulty in terms of its economic fundamentals. Its projected deficit is some $24 billion. The unemployment rate in most regions is much higher than the national rate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765300">The Conservative government has boasted about a stimulus plan that it has committed to but has not actually issued cheques for. It is a matter of, “Here is what we have promised to do and we have promised to do it so many times over and over again”. Eventually projects might get the money. However, before we know it, things are going to lapse and the government is going to say that the project did not get done or that it did not manage to get the money out, and it is just going to lapse. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765301">I am sure this is going to happen. Much of the money that should have been spent and the cheques that should have gone out to approved projects are going to lapse. It will never happen and we will never get the benefit of the job creation that was supposed to happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765302">Members will know that, because it also happened in the last fiscal year with the infrastructure funding. I think it was somewhere around $3 billion of approved infrastructure funding that lapsed and never got out. It was approved and ready to go and the government just did not issue the cheques. This is one of the reasons that members have to hold the government accountable on things.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1765303">It is easy to use this place and to say that the Province of Ontario has decided that it wants to enter into an agreement with the Government of Canada, which they did. There is a copy of it. It is about four pages long and includes a number of details. This was an initiative by the Province of Ontario directly related to what it can do to create jobs and investments in Ontario to deal with the economic crisis in the province. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765304">We have a system of taxation under our Excise Tax Act that permits the harmonization of taxes. As I indicated, we do have three provinces that have formally harmonized their sales taxes, including all of the maritime provinces. Now two other provinces have decided they want to make their system more efficient and do some other things in conjunction with that, as part of their program for economic recovery in their provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765305">As members would know if they looked at Bill <Document DbId="4268485" Type="3">C-62</Document>, it does not talk about the tax rate we are going to charge on haircuts, etc. That would be in a bill that would appear in the legislatures of Ontario and B.C. Our bill actually has amendments to the Excise Tax Act, and we would have to have the Excise Tax Act sitting beside us to know what some of these clauses mean.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765306">I went through the clauses that were of interest to me last night, and I think I understand the bill a little bit better. However, I am pretty sure that most members have no idea what is in this bill and what it means, what it means for direct sellers for instance, or what it means in terms of non-taxable items and how the system will deal with those to make sure that things do not slip through the cracks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765307">The bottom line is that this bill is an enabling piece of legislation. What it does is that it makes the necessary amendments to the Excise Tax Act, so that the agreements the Government of Canada has entered into with Ontario and B.C. can be formalized and those provinces will be able to pass the necessary legislation to conform to the agreed framework in the memorandum of agreement and the Excise Tax Act, as amended by this.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1765312">Madam Speaker, we have a situation now where the governments of two provinces have committed to harmonizing their taxes effective July 1, 2010.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765313">The Province of Ontario, in conjunction with the legislation it is bringing in to harmonize the sales tax, is also concurrently going to bring in income tax cuts and other credits for residents of Ontario. These cuts are going to be effective on January 1, 2010, six months before the HST in that province would take effect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765314">For the Ontario government to be able to make that effective January 1, its plans are to pass its legislation on the HST with the other permanent income tax cuts before Christmas. It cannot do that unless Bill <Document DbId="4268485" Type="3">C-62</Document> makes the necessary changes to the Excise Tax Act so that Ontario's bill conforms with the laws of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765315">I wish the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> would simply get up in the House and announce to everybody that the government made a deal with the Province of Ontario, which faces a great deal of difficulty in terms of its economy and wants to move forward with these tax cuts and the harmonization. On a projected basis, these tax cuts and the harmonization would create over 500,000 new jobs, create $47 billion in increased capital investment and increase annual incomes by up to 8.8% or some $29.4 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765316">The consequences of this legislation to Ontario are enormous. We have to ask whether the Parliament of Canada feels that it should not pass Bill <Document DbId="4268485" Type="3">C-62</Document>, thus effectively stopping the Province of Ontario from carrying out its decisions to address its economic crisis and therefore being able to make a contribution towards remedying the economic crisis facing our country as a whole. That is really the big question. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765317">The provinces have a choice about whether or not to do this. I could make a case, as others have, by indicating that a haircut would cost 8% more, but that is not exactly true because the hair salon or the barber shop also incurs provincial sales tax on all the other supplies and services related to its business and they all cascade down. Once we convert, their costs of doing business will go down in a perfect flow-through fashion in a competitive economy. In fact, their prices will go down. Even though the 8% tax will be added for the additional provincial tax component, the overall price really should not change. In fact, it theoretically should go down because of the built-in taxes in the underlying costs of doing business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765318">Canadians are going to hear a lot of stories, but the best thing they can do is to ask for all of the information on what a harmonized sales tax is and visit the provincial websites to see what the plans are. They will also see a copy of the agreement that outlines all of the details. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765319">In Ontario, for instance, notwithstanding that the harmonization of the tax would affect only about 17% of the goods and services that we purchase, there is going to be a very substantial reduction in personal income taxes for all Ontarians. In the first year, families are going to get a $1,000 transitional credit. There will also be a sales tax credit increase to reflect the fact that the harmonized sales tax has both levels of government tax included in it.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1765320">These are offsets. Canadians should know that to the extent that some exemptions will no longer be there, that is pursuant to the agreement. The agreement limited the exemptions to 5% of all of the goods and services that are being offered. Therefore there had to be some streamlining of the benefits. However, to take that into account, some things may be taxed now that were not previously taxed, but there is going to be a permanent offset through income taxes as well as through tax credits and the one-time transitional credit of $1,000 for a family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765321">There is more for people to know about. In Ontario, for instance, I know some of the members are saying this is a tax grab and asking how we feel about it. In fact, after implementation the provincial sales tax revenues to the Province of Ontario will actually decline. It is not a tax grab. In fact the revenues are decreasing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765322">If we look at the implications for Ontario, there is the possibility of getting the job creation activity that it drastically needs, as well as business investment. Businesses should be able to pass on the savings to them by investing further through creating jobs. We cannot ignore the job creation issue. It is critical in the economy of Ontario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765323">The Government of Ontario has made this decision. I am hopeful that Canadians will take the opportunity to inform themselves instead of listening to linear arguments.</ParaText>

There was the argument that when we lowered the GST, gas price savings would be passed on to consumers. We all know that did not take place. In fact the profits are still up. Canadians actually have less tax revenue, and the companies did not pass the savings on to consumers.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1765327">Madam Speaker, the price of gas is affected not just by the level of taxes. The taxes have not been changing up and down. The commodity prices certainly have. Therefore, I do not accept the member's argument.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765328">However, I can say that we have examples. For instance, when the GST was cut, the savings that should have been passed on to people were not. Therefore we know the Conservatives have not followed through on the GST. An example would be, and most Canadians would understand, the price of a theatre ticket to go to a show, to watch a movie. That price did not go down. They still charge the same price arguing that they had additional costs so that despite whatever reduction there was in the GST, they increased their own costs and therefore the price is the same.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765329">It does take some discipline, but in a competitive economy where the costs cascading at least from the provincial sales tax level are not passed on, if they are not invested in investments in that business or passed on that means the bottom line of the business has gone up. It means that it has decided to pocket those.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765330">That is why we need a competitive economy. That is what the issue is. It is all about competition. Businesses that are not going to be competitively priced will lose business and will no longer be able to participate. Everyone does it at their own peril. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1765334">I want to read something from one of my first nations chiefs. It states, “I am opposed to the harmonization of the Ontario retail sales tax and GST. As proposed an HST will impose additional tax burdens on Ontario residents during a severe economic downturn. I also hope and expect that your government respects first nations' rights, that tax exemption that is entrenched under law and in the treaties. The point of sale exemption for first nations should be maintained and should apply to both portions of the proposed harmonized tax and be reflected in the comprehensive tax implementation agreement. The imposition of a harmonized tax structure will impact and potentially perpetuate poverty. Your government has statutory contractual and common law obligations to consult with first nations and must engage their communities prior to implementing the harmonized sales tax”.</ParaText>

The $6 billion bribe fund is set up explicitly for this. Both provinces, Ontario and British Columbia, have said that without the $6 billion coming from Parliament, with the support of the member, his party and the government, this would not be happening at all. We would not be having this conversation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765342">In terms of first nations' right to consult, that sits in the Constitution and is constantly ignored. It was ignored by his government when it was in office. It is being ignored again, because this is an effect of Parliament having a direct impact on first nations in Canada, period. The Constitution explicitly states that we then must consult and accommodate first nations. Every court decision that has come down has said so. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765343">Does Bill <Document DbId="4268485" Type="3">C-62</Document> have an effect on the lives and the quality of life of first nations in Canada? Yes. Does the federal government have a duty to consult? Yes. Is it consulting? Absolutely not, and that is what is wrong. This will very likely end up in a court, and he should know that if he has been paying any attention to first nations history, law and practice in the last 85 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765344">The fact of the matter is that he is helping enable the HST to come in. If he thought it was such a great idea, then certainly he would have campaigned on it in the last election, but not having been in Mississauga, I am going to take a guess. I am going to guess that he did not mention this. It was not in his flyers. It was not a promise. They have no mandate to do this, and this is why the people of Mississauga and all across Ontario and British Columbia are upset with him, his party, and the Conservative Party as well. They feel that these politicians have no mandate to do this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765345">The mandate is $6 billion. That could be used for other things. He wants to talk about first nations. He should intimately know then that the housing on first nations reserves across this country is in desperate need of help. It is stuck at 1982 funding levels. Surely the $6 billion would be better applied to something like affordable housing in this country.</ParaText>

There are obviously a lot of costs involved and they were negotiated with the provinces individually, as were the other three when they came in, and as the province of Quebec negotiated its deal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765348">This is part of the process that it goes through, but the bottom line, and I do not want to be coy with any of it, is that there is no question that if we were to defeat Bill <Document DbId="4268485" Type="3">C-62</Document> and these amendments never passed, then there would be no harmonized sales tax in Ontario or B.C.

This bill is the culmination of an operation that the Conservatives began four years ago that has brought about the largest shift in Canadian history of taxes from the corporate sector on to the backs of ordinary hard-working Canadians. That is what the Liberals are supporting. That is what this bill is about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765351">To understand the scam, it has often been said that for a swindle to work, it requires two dishonest people, the person who is putting the scam together and a dishonest person on the other side who thinks he or she will actually gain from it. That is what we have here. The swindle put together by the Conservatives is the ideological continuation of what they have been doing for the past four years. The dupes in the Liberal Party are supporting them of course, and the numbskull premiers of British Columbia and Ontario think that somehow they are going to be putting money in their pockets, whereas in fact they are just further damaging the economies that have already been undermined by the Conservatives' actions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765352">Let us look at the genesis of this problem and how it began with the arrival of the Conservatives, shall we? Their ideology is that governments should play no role in the economy, that there is a pristine marketplace that makes all of the right choices, that anyone who thinks that governments or the state has a role in this is trying to pick winners. Let us look at it for what it is. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765353">The Conservatives have decided there is one winner in the Canadian economy and it is the oil sector in Alberta. That is what has been destabilizing an erstwhile balanced economy that was built up in this country since the second world war. Successive governments always understood that to give value to the second largest country in the world with a minor population, today just in the order of 30 million, we required vision. We required the government to play a role in ensuring that we could develop our primary sector, forestry in particular and mining, that we could have a strong manufacturing sector as well, and that we could develop as modern times have allowed us to do, a tertiary sector, the service sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765354">A lot of people look at the unemployment created since the fall of 2008 when the current recession began, but what we saw was that as a direct result of the Conservatives' choices, because governing is a reflection of one's choices and one's priorities, as a result of the Conservatives' choices backed every step of the way by their henchmen in the Liberal Party, they have reduced corporate taxes by $60 billion. The effect of that has been to provide that fiscal space of $60 billion to the most profitable corporations. I say the most profitable corporations because it should be obvious, but for some people it is not, that by definition if a company had not made a profit, if it was breaking even or losing money, it did not get any of the money from those tax reductions. Who did? Mostly the very profitable oil sector. Companies like EnCana saw windfall profits of hundreds of millions of dollars, which was totally unexpected and certainly unnecessary for it in terms of its operations, as did Canada's major chartered banks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765355">Who suffered? The manufacturing sector and the forestry sector centred in Ontario and Quebec for the manufacturing and the forestry sector which included a lot of lost jobs in British Columbia and in New Brunswick on top of those mostly in Ontario and in Quebec. That was a choice. Before the current recession hit, we had already bled off hundreds of thousands of jobs in the manufacturing and forestry sectors in Ontario and Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765356">One of the primary reasons for that was the high Canadian dollar which was being stoked by the petrodollars coming into Alberta that does not even internalize the environmental and social costs of the exploitation of the tar sands. There are three basic principles of sustainable development that have to apply to any exploitation of that nature. They are internalization of costs, polluter pay and user pay. Of course the Conservatives apply none of it. The Liberals are ill-placed to even discuss the subject. They signed Kyoto, and as Eddie Goldenberg, the former chief of staff for Jean Chrétien correctly pointed out, the only reason they signed it is for public relations purposes. That is why under the Liberals for 13 years Canada had the worst record in the world in terms of greenhouse gas reduction and that has simply become worse under the Conservatives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765357">The Liberals did nothing, the Conservatives do not want to do anything and the Bloc cannot do anything. It is a good thing that our leader, the leader of the NDP, is heading to Copenhagen. That at least offers some hope. I am told that this very morning, Bill <Document DbId="3643764" Type="4">C-311</Document>, which scandalously the Liberals have been holding up in committee, was finally allowed to go through, so there is a ray of hope on the horizon being provided by the New Democratic Party.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1765358">The $60 billion of tax reductions was only possible by creating a similar fiscal space. How was that fiscal space created? It was created by pillaging $57 billion in the employment insurance account and turning it into general revenues of the government. Again, it was with the culpable complicity of the spineless Liberals who have no principles and no beliefs. They backed the Conservatives every step of the way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765359">It should be remembered, as one of my colleagues said earlier, that the Bloc Québécois also voted for the first two Conservative budgets. That is something the New Democratic Party of Canada has never done. We have always stood up against the Conservative vision for the economy. We have always resolutely voted against the Conservative budgets and we are very proud of that record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765360">Some people have said that they may be taking $57 billion from the EI account, but it is a notional amount. They are turning it into general revenue, so who really cares, because it does not change anything; it is all still government money. There is a huge mistake in that analysis. Every single company in Canada, whether it was making money, breaking even or losing money, had to pay into that employment insurance account for every single one of its employees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765361">That money was paid in by employers and employees for a dedicated purpose, to take care of the cyclical nature of our economy for a day like today in the middle of a recession when there are dramatic job losses. The fund would be there. That is what it was put in for. To add insult to injury, $19 billion is calculated to be missing from the account now, because they have frozen contributions as part of the recession.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765362">That means that the very same companies that were losing money in forestry or manufacturing and had made their compulsory contributions for every single employee into that fund saw that fund turned into a fiscal space that was given in the form of tax reductions for the most profitable corporations in Canada, stimulating even more rapidly the Canadian economy, with regard to the oil sector, at least, and pushing the Canadian dollar higher as those petrodollars came in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765363">The result, in the clearest possible terms, is that companies that were already losing money in the forestry and manufacturing sectors were directly subsidizing the very petroleum sector that was causing the high dollar and making their exports even more difficult because of the very high Canadian dollar. It is similar to one being asked to pay one's executioner. That is exactly what happened here with regard to the Canadian economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765364">That is the Conservatives' way of doing business. That is what they wanted to do. That is what they set out to do. They set out to destroy the manufacturing and forestry sectors at the altar of the expediency of the rapid exploitation of the tar sands. As if that were not enough, projects like Keystone, one of the many pipeline projects that the Conservatives have put in place in the west since they arrived in government, are exporting the rawest form of the production of the tar sands straight to the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765365">We are exporting jobs. Keystone alone represents 18,000 lost jobs for Canada. We are not only stupid enough to send all of this south without any added value here, but we are sending it so fast that we are not even holding on to anything. We are not even internalizing the costs to the environment today and the costs for future generations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765366">The internalization of costs is a principle that Canadians all understand. When we buy tires for our car, the province adds a $3 fee to take care of the recycling of the tires. That is the environmental cost of the tires being paid by the person who is buying the tires. That is only fair. If people take the metro or the bus to work, or they take their bike or walk and they do not own a car, why should they pay for that recycling out of their general tax obligations? Why should they be paying to recycle their neighbour's tires? Everybody gets that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765367">It should be the same thing with the tar sands. It is an important resource, but it is not immune from the application of general principles of sustainable development. What one does is internalize the cost on a barrel of petroleum produced out of the tar sands. That would be the equivalent of approximately $3 to $4 a barrel. The internalization of the cost of sequestration of the greenhouse gases or their reduction and the treatment of all the pollution that is now being held back is going to be a problem that we are shovelling forward for future generations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765368">It is wonderful to watch the Conservatives, those great moralizers, wagging their index fingers under our collective noses, always telling us how to be and allowing the worst pollution on the planet to take place here in Canada in the Athabasca tar sands. Right now, the dykes at the tar ponds are the longest dams in the world. They are holding back what is not seeping right into the underground water. This is the greatest source of pollution right now in Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1765369"> We are destroying ecosystems. We are destroying groundwater. We are causing cancers that are exceptional, that can only be traced back to the chemical products being produced in the tar sands. At the very least, we should be internalizing the cost of that, instead of sending the bill to future generations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765370">Contrary to their theoretical position on all these matters, what we are doing with the Conservatives is enjoying ourselves today, taking everything we can for ourselves and letting the future generations of tomorrow fend for themselves. At the very least, a fund could be put aside out of those important revenues. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765371">Both the internalization of costs and the setting aside of that fund would reduce the pressure on the Canadian dollar. This would make it possible to go back to a more balanced economy like the one we had built up since the second world war. It would be easier to export than it is right now with the high Canadian dollar. We could at the same time put in place an infrastructure of green renewables, hydrogen, wind, hydro and others that can be developed in this great country of ours.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765372">However, there is a singular lack of vision among the government benches on this issue. The Conservatives do not care about future generations. They love to pose with future generations. There is nothing easier than to get a Conservative to pose at a hockey rink on a Saturday with a bunch of kids. What about the day when we will no longer be able to play hockey outdoors in Canada because of global warming and because of their incompetence and their negligence? That is the issue that has to be discussed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765373">We in Canada are in a unique position in the world. We have extraordinary resources that we can and should be developing, but we should be doing it cleanly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765374">The Conservatives are so much at the beck and call of our American neighbours. They are in such a hurry to get everything through the National Energy Board. They are in such a hurry to get all their approvals for these pipelines straight south, the raw agreement, to export not only our wealth but also jobs. That is the scandal of the Conservative approach. There is $60 billion in tax decreases for the richest corporations. Some $57 billion has been pillaged from the employment insurance account. Businesses that have already subsidized the oil patch are going to be asked to re-contribute in the order of $19 billion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765375">Right now, the government is saying, “We have a plan.

The bleeding off of hundreds of thousands of jobs in the manufacturing and forestry sectors is a direct result of what the Conservative government chose to do. We are leaving a debt to future generations in terms of the current deficit structure that we are putting in place, which will be one that we will not be able to get away from for decades. At the very least, we should be leaving something that future generations can use. We should be bequeathing them something in terms of clean renewables.

Whereas the former premier of B.C., now a Liberal MP, said, “It is absolutely horrendous and it is criminal on the part of the Conservative government to be pushing this policy in a time of deep economic recession”.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1765425">Madam Speaker, the actions of the Conservative government, with the help of its Liberal henchmen, have been devastating for the Canadian economy. We had already bled off hundreds of thousands of jobs prior to the current recession setting in. The addition of this $6 billion tax on the backs of those who can least afford it will simply exacerbate the situation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765426">People are on fixed income. A lot of people have lost their jobs. A lot of people are on social assistance. People cannot find 8% more for their heating oil. Yet that is exactly what the Conservatives have decided to do, to use the very weakness they created by their choices and their policies, where they killed manufacturing and forestry, to go in now for the kill on the Liberal governments in Ontario and B.C., their willing co-conspirators.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765427"> It is commonplace that for a scam to work, it requires two dishonest people. It requires the person conceiving the scam, and the Conservatives have said from the beginning what their plan is with regard to this tax, and it requires the henchmen in the Liberal Party, both here and in the provinces. It requires two dishonest people and that is what they have.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1765428">Madam Speaker, since we are talking about economic statistics, I would like to remind my hon. colleague that, according to the numbers for the month of November, the unemployment rate dropped by one tenth of a percentage point from 8.6% to 8.5%. Experts predicted that 15,000 jobs would be created in November, but in fact, 80,000 jobs were created, which means that, in fact, our economic action plan is producing results for the country. I think that if the member wants to talk about the government's record, he should take that into account.</ParaText>

They have killed Quebec's economy. They have killed the manufacturing sector. They have killed the forestry sector. This is no time for them to start lecturing others.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1765430">Madam Speaker, it is an honour to rise and talk about this issue while we can in the House of Commons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765431">I agree with my colleague that it is also important to mention the tar sands. My community of Windsor, Ontario is going to be significantly affected by the tar sands, because the refining of that gunk is going to be done across the border in Detroit. Windsor is downwind of the refining facilities that are being expanded, so we are getting the consequences of it on both ends. That is a real issue. Progressive environmental groups from all political parties, both on the Canadian and American sides, have been trying to work together to prevent some of this from happening. It is critical because it affects not only our economy but also our health, as we are the people who are going to breathe this in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765432">On this bill, I think it is important to talk a bit about the process in the House of Commons and the “harpocrisy” of the Conservative government. It is really outstanding because on this issue, the government is ramming the bill through the House really quickly, whereas on other issues where the government could actually get support from all political parties and affect the economy, it could get a lot of benefit from but does not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765433">I would point to the process that the government is going through with infrastructure funding. The Conservative government is not using the gas tax, for example, as a model to get some of these projects out the door. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765434">What we are getting here is not only a procedural ramming through of legislation in this session of Parliament, abetted by the Liberals and the Bloc, but we are also missing out on the important work that takes place in this place to ensure that when legislation goes through, it is done properly. The government is behaving similarly to the American-style Republican Party, adding riders to money bills to change legislation as opposed to actually doing the good work that usually happens at committees and providing the due diligence necessary to investigate the impact of legislation on various groups. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765435">Specifically, we would have a debate here in the House of Commons and then we would move the bill to committee if there were interest. Then at committee there would be witnesses who would be called from all corners of Canada to provide testimony on the impacts of a policy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765436">The impact of the HST is certainly going to be significant for Ontario and British Columbia. It does involve other provinces, as was noted in the House before. There is actually a history of Conservative governments trying to ram such legislation down the throats of residents, aided and abetted by some of their provincial support mechanisms. This time it is the Liberal Party in the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765437">However, in the past, I can think of the Grant Devine government of Saskatchewan, for example. That corrupt government was eventually thrown out of power and the HST was repealed by the Roy Romanow NDP government. That government then brought in great legislation, balanced the books, cleaned up corruption and set a significant mark for that province. Everyone remembers the corrupt Grant Devine Conservative government. That is important because it is tied to the HST.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765438">We also see what has taken place with the Darrell Dexter NDP government in Nova Scotia. That government has rebated the home heating portion of the HST right away, as it starts to delist items from the HST.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765439">Meanwhile, what we have here in Ontario and also in British Columbia is the new tax that is to be introduced. These provinces are not even considering removing a percentile point off the tax or delisting items that are important to consumers. We are not talking about luxury items, like jewellery or home entertainment devices or whatever; we are talking about haircuts or things that kids need to do, like going to camps or hockey practices. All of these things will now be subject to another level of tax. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765440">Ironically, the supposed fiscal wizards on that side of the House are actually going to be borrowing money from Canadian taxpayers at a time when Canada is running a deficit, and that money will be taxed back from Canadians. Canadians are waking up to this. It is a sensitive issue and it is also an issue where they understand the economics. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765441">Right now, the government has a large deficit and it is going to increase that deficit through some of its policies. One of its policies was large corporate tax cuts, and I will talk about the effects of those in a few minutes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765442">It is important to note that I had the parliamentary research bureau do some research for me. The bureau is available to every member. I submitted some information to the bureau and asked it to look at the costs of borrowing the funds from the public purse. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1765443">The bureau ran a model, and I am going to cite the results of this independent report from the economists at the Parliamentary research service. They said that the average annual interest rate on the market debt of the federal government from 1998-99 to 2007-08 was 5.3%. Should the federal government borrow $5.9 billion in order to finance the proposed transfer to British Columbia and Ontario, and should it repay that amount in exactly 10 years, and assuming an average interest rate of 5.3%, the total nominal cost to the federal government would be about $9.9 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765444">That is important. We do not know if we will, but the report assumes that we are actually going to be recovering and getting out of recession.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765445">The minister mentioned a few minutes ago that the jobless rate was going down, but one of the reasons it is actually falling in a place like <Affiliation DbId="128491" Type="2">Windsor West</Affiliation> is that people are running out of benefits. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765446">There has been high employment for years. We have been warning the government and the previous government of a lack of sectoral strategy for the manufacturing sector. The member for <Affiliation DbId="128308" Type="2">Outremont</Affiliation> was quite right in talking about how the petrodollar has raised the Canadian dollar so high and so quickly that we have been shedding tens of thousands of jobs in the manufacturing sector over the last number of years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765447">Therefore, in communities like Windsor, we now have people who are exiting the benefit system that was available to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765448">It is important to recognize what we are going to borrow and what we are going to get in terms of a return. I have seen some of the documents and read through the argument on why do this for the manufacturing sector? The HST will eliminate some taxation that is happening on multiple levels. There is no doubt about that, because it does happen, and that is a fair argument to make.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765449">However, then we have to believe that those savings will get passed on to the consumer. I do not believe that is going to happen. Those savings would have to be passed on to the consumer and then the theory is that people can buy more and can stimulate the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765450">I mentioned in earlier exchanges in the House that it was the argument put forth when we had no conditions put on the reduction of the GST on gasoline prices. What we saw was the GST reduced on gasoline. So the coffers of the nation lost that revenue coming in, but we have not seen that passed on to consumers. I have yet to see a study that shows that those savings have been passed on to consumers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765451"> I would suspect many Canadians justly question gasoline prices, especially because the government killed the only program capable of monitoring that, a monitoring agency, a watchdog program, that would have been fairly and independently out there. We have the industry that is policing itself, which is ludicrous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765452">One of the reasons I talk about the important process when the legislation passes is that we do figure out ways to ameliorate problems when we have legislation in front of us. Earlier this past week, we had the <Affiliation DbId="128715" Type="4">Minister of State for Small Business and Tourism</Affiliation> before us at committee, who admitted there had been no study done on the effects on tourism of this particular HST grab.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765453">That is critical, because there was a study done by the Tourism Industry Association of Ontario and another done in British Columbia by Butchart Gardens, which show that tourism is going to be affected significantly by this HST grab, because hotels, restaurants, theme attractions, travel, and all of those things are going to have a big whack tax put right on top of them right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765454">The tourism industry is the fourth largest sector in the Canadian economy, when all of its components are put together. It has been facing a perfect storm as well. Not only was there the introduction of the U.S. passport requirement, which is a real challenge, because only about 35% of Americans carry passports; but we have also had the petro dollar affecting the tourism industry, all the way from the Niagara region across Ontario, and even in my region, where the high dollar, especially its rapid acceleration, has resulted in a shift. It used to be an advantage for Americans to come over and take advantage of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765455">Then the government whacked the tourism industry again when it cut out the GST rebate. This is the party of our good friend Brian Mulroney, who brought in the GST, and there were severe economic repercussions for the tourism industry from that. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1765456">In fact when he introduced the GST in 1991, the food service industry in Canada suffered a 10.6% decline in real sales, 7.3% of which was attributed to the GST. Once again, it was our Conservative friends who introduced that tax on Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765457">We have a situation now where we have had a couple of hearings and some witnesses yesterday at the tourism committee. As we happened to be studying another sector of the economy in committee, we were able to get some testimony from them on the HST. They see this as a significant challenge. We had some good testimony, and that is important because they are calling for some rebates and a series of things to be delisted, but we cannot really get to that full evidence and analysis because there is no actual study at committee on this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765458">It is shameful for the Conservatives, and the Liberals in particular, not even to allow public debate to take place, not even to allow that evidence from witnesses who are important in our sectoral economies to come forward and to show what challenges would take place. There is complete ignorance on that. They prevented some really good evidence being heard on how this will affect the tourism industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765459">People have to be wondering about their representation, when they are in southern Ontario and look at the Niagara region and elsewhere, where we have to compete so hard for dollars. What is interesting is that our tourism deficit has ballooned under this government, and I will get into that later. We have seen U.S. visits to Canada, which account for three-quarters of all tourist visits here, decline significantly. On top of that, we have actually seen that deficit expand quite significantly, and so we have been suffering job losses in those industries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765460">A number of different independent studies have been done by the Tourism Industry Association of Ontario. It looked at a number of different scenarios as examples of what the HST is going to increase and what the industry is going to face. Keep in mind that Canada is already one of the most expensive places in the world to visit. I believe we rank fourth in the world in terms of the overall expense of a visit, and now on top of that, we are going to have another level of taxation that will further add to that component. That is a real problem, especially given the fact, as I mentioned earlier, that the dollar is high and U.S. visits are down and we have a struggling economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765461">Therefore, borrowing from our own taxpayers and from these businesses to throw another tax on top of them is going to affect a number of different scenarios.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765462">One scenario is the weekend getaway, which has a base cost of $1,603. Currently we have an 8.3% tax on that, but when we actually add the HST and future taxes and incremental taxation, taxes on these visitors are going to increase by 43.6%. When we look at the incremental taxation related to activities in that type of vacation and take all the different components of that vacation and visit, we see that taxes are going up significantly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765463">Another scenario is a one week camping holiday. The government cannot even leave camping alone. This is one of the ironic things about this in Ontario. This is another Dalton McGuinty tax day on Canada Day; he cannot help himself, apparently. Maybe we need to have a motion in the House of Commons to have Dalton leave our Canada Day alone, because he brought in his health care tax a number of years ago after not telling the public about that, and then once again went through an election and did not tell the public about that. Now the Ontario government is introducing a new tax on camping.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765464">My son is a Beaver and his Beaver group will be an example of the new taxation. We have to do fundraising for them as it is. We live in the inner city, where some of the kids cannot afford some of these events. In fact his troop, because there are kids in it that cannot afford the different events, was recently subsidized by the other troops for a fun day that we had in Windsor. I thank all the volunteers for that at the Cleary International Centre. It was a terrific family event day. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765465">Now when they go camping they are going to get taxed. When they go camping now, the estimated base cost is $2,173 with current taxes of $188 at a rate of 7.9%. That will go up and there may be future taxation on the other things that are added on. So the association is estimating there will about a 33.2% tax increase overall when all of the activities of a camping trip are put together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765466">We could not even exempt camping in Canada. We could not even have a discussion or a debate about that; we just have to accept this is going to happen.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1765467">We also looked at a shopping weekend in Toronto where good friends of the Conservatives, the Liberals, are right now in the Toronto area. A shopping weekend of $4,856 is the average shopping weekend in Toronto according to the study and there is going to be a 14.2% increase on that when we add in the hotels and all the different things that people would have. So that is going to make it more challenging for Toronto as a destination. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765468">We have already had a number of challenges such as SARS for example. In my riding people from the Detroit area refused to come to Windsor or Toronto explicitly because of the SARS issue and we had to debunk all that. It has taken years to recover from that issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765469">There have been challenges and tourism destinations are very important for the country, not just for Toronto. Tourism is our fourth largest industry and once again we have not been able to study this issue or to have any meaningful input on it other than these outside measures others have been doing. They are from credible companies. HLT is the advisory group for this one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765470">A family ski holiday of $4,363 ends up with the incremental taxation resulting in a 25.3% increase. That is the estimation because things like lift tickets and a whole series of other things that did not have any tax now are subjected to this new tax grab.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765471">In terms of the impact on the overall economy, it was good to have the Canadian Tourism Commission at our committee. It does a very good job. Madame McKenzie runs it. It has many challenges. It has a small budget, small department. Interestingly enough, the Liberals moved it toward the Olympics and that is a big event and destination that hopefully does take place. We hope that will turn some things around. The CTC said, “Canadian outbound travel spending continued to rise in light of a strong Canadian dollar to reach a record level of $26.9 billion in 2008, an increase of 15.5% over 2007. As a result Canada's international travel deficit, the difference between what Canadian residents spend abroad and what international travellers spend in Canada, rose to a record of $12.6 billion in 2008”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765472">That is devastating. When there is a significant deficit like that in one of our largest industries, it is critical to turn that around. We are not just talking about Americans or other destination marketers coming in that are going to have to pay the HST. When the government scrapped the GST rebate, they were very upset about that and many people said that was one of the reasons they would not come back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765473">With the HST imposed in Ontario and British Columbia there could be more incentives for more Canadians to spend their tourism dollars outside of Canada. Part of the CTC's mandate is to have Canadians spend money in their own communities or to travel around Canada. But now we are adding another level of cost when we are competing for tourism dollars at a time when we have the significant challenges of a crumbling economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765474">This is just absolute utter nonsense that we would not get into a responsible evaluation about the impacts of this, whether we agree or disagree with the ideology of the bill, but we should be concerned about getting some empirical data to analyze and propose some solutions that would look at this and show some leadership. To simply say we are washing our hands of it is unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765475">It is important that Canadians realize this is the agenda. When the Conservatives brought in the GST supported by the Liberals, I remember the big scrap that was supposed to happen. It never took place and there have been successive attempts to bring in provinces.

              <ParaText id="1765478">Madam Speaker, I would like to come back to what my colleague said and talk again about the harmonized tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765479">We believe that the provinces should be treated equitably and have the right to make their own decisions. Why would this Parliament object to the idea of a province harmonizing its sales tax with the federal tax? On what basis should we tell British Columbia and Ontario that we will not let them harmonize their tax with the federal tax?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765480">It is healthy and democratic, in a country that wants the system to work, to enable the provinces to make things easier for taxpayers to understand and to harmonize their taxes. We are not forcing them to do this. They asked us to bring in legislation that would let them harmonize their sales tax if they wanted to. That decision will be up to the governments of British Columbia and Ontario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765481">I would also like to quote some statistics, because my colleague also said that the country was not in good shape. He mentioned the unemployment rate. Not only did the unemployment rate go down from 8.6% to 8.5% in November, but 80,000 jobs were created in this country. That is significant. It means that the economic action plan is working and is producing tangible results. We do not wish anyone ill, but while Canada gained 80,000 jobs, the United States lost 15,000 jobs. That shows that this government made the right decisions to help workers and stimulate the economy. All sorts of statistics prove it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765482">I would remind this House that the government has introduced four different measures to support unemployed workers, in addition to new measures to help self-employed workers. Because of a whole series of actions we have taken, Canada's economy is in relatively good shape at present. Of course, it is still fragile, but at least we made the right decisions in taxpayers' interests.</ParaText>

When we look at the way in which we gather statistics through Service Canada and other measures, it is interesting that we do not count the people who have fallen off the system or are no longer looking for work. They no longer count. They almost do not exist in our society. About 50% of people with disabilities are unemployed in this country and many of them are not even counted in the actual roles that are out there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765485">In ridings like mine and other places, people are running out of employment insurance. That is why it was important to get some extension of benefits. I did appreciate working with the government on that extension of those benefits. It is an important thing that is helping some people, but the clock is ticking down on them. It is turning into a situation where people are getting a little bit more desperate. The statistics are very deceiving as to what the real economy is right now.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1765489">Madam Speaker, this is really the most offensive thing and I think Canadians understand this. They understand the issue, not only in Ontario but in British Columbia where the polls indicate 80% of people understand the implications of the HST, what it means to them and their families. They are opposed to it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765490">The most offensive part about this is that the Conservatives and Liberals are telling people, who have concerns about the HST, that they do not matter. The Conservatives and Liberals do not care. It does not matter whether it is ordinary citizens who are now going to have to pay the HST when they buy something for their kids or a necessity of life. All the experts in the different industries that have analysed the effects of this type of policy have been told to get lost. </ParaText>

It will not listen to ways that may improve the situation or soften the impact or look at a transition of some of the measures. All the concepts that are out there want to be proposed and are available from people who want to testify. The government, on the other hand, aided and abetted by the other parties, is basically saying it does not matter and it does not care.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1765495">It is important to note that this legislation can contain what it wants. It can contain exemptions. We have heard about aboriginal people who are being affected.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1765502">Madam Speaker, I would like to share my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="128382" Type="2">Sault Ste. Marie</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765503">I believe it is essential for me to speak today, on behalf of my constituents, against this insidious new tax. I say this because when it became clear that the party in power was determined to inflict a new tax on the people of Ontario and British Columbia, I sent out a mailing to the residents of <Affiliation DbId="128127" Type="2">London—Fanshawe</Affiliation>. I asked them what they thought of the HST, the new tax that Conservatives and Liberals plan to enact on July 1, their gift to Ontario and British Columbia on Canada Day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765504">I communicate quite regularly with my constituents and they respond in significant numbers. We have a good dialogue, and I always appreciate hearing from them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765505">However, the response to the HST survey was astounding. I received hundreds and hundreds of mail-backs, emails and letters. I have never had such a response. Despite nearly four years of mismanagement by the members from across the aisle, four years of cynically telling Canadians that our environment does not matter, that child care can be had for $100 a month, that housing does not have to be affordable, that first nation children do not need a school, after four years of ideological agenda from this group that basically says that there is no room for the aspirations of Canadians or the values that we cherish, my constituents have responded with renewed and greater anger, greater than I have ever seen. Because of those nearly four years of bad government, my constituents said, with absolutely clarity, that they had enough. This tax grab was the last straw and they counted on New Democrats to defend their interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765506">We have heard repeatedly from the <Affiliation DbId="128634" Type="2">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> that this legislation is the will of the provinces, that this is democracy in action. The truth is we are fighting a bill, in the name of the <Affiliation DbId="128634" Type="2">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, to amend the excise tax and enable the HST.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765507">The party in power insists it is innocent. According to the <Affiliation DbId="128634" Type="2">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, the bill is to accommodate the provinces. Despite his insistence that this is not a federal bill, despite his persistent attempt to wash his hands of this bill, it stands in his name. I would suggest he has much greater responsibility than he cares to admit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765508">I can understand his desperate need to distance himself from the HST because it is, quite simply, the wrong tax, at the worst of times. It will increase the cost of haircuts, home heating, gasoline, firewood, Internet, cell phones, snow removal, newspapers, magazines, camping fees, veterinary care, taxi fares, carpet cleaning, landscaping, utilities, commercial property rentals, postage stamps, courier fees, domestic air, rail and commercial bus tickets, funerals, all of these and more, by an additional 8%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765509">Imagine one earning minimum wage, trying to raise a family and, now, despite all the sacrifices, is hit with an additional 8% cost of living. Many women in Canada will face particular hardships due to this increase in the cost of living. It is well known that single women and single mothers face higher poverty levels than any other group.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765510"> According to the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, most anti-poverty strategies in Canada and elsewhere have concentrated on reducing child poverty, but other groups within the population are even more disadvantaged. In 2007, for example, 9.5% of young people under age 18, the child poverty measure, had low incomes and 23.6% of Canadian women heading lone-parent families had incomes below the after-tax level. In fact, the incidents of low income for female lone-parent families was almost five times as high as that of two-parent families with children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765511"> At the same time, 14.3% of women aged 65 and over, who are on their own, had low incomes. Seniors living on their own experienced a low income rate almost 13 times higher than seniors living in families in 2007. The depths of poverty of these groups was significant. On average, the after-tax income of senior women on their own was $2,400 below the poverty level. However, the average after-tax income of women who had lone-parent families was $7,500 below the after-tax income level.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1765512">To a large extent, these groups of women might be described as the forgotten poor. They are generally not mentioned in budgets or stimulus packages, and with one or two notable exceptions, no specific programs are developed to address their needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765513"> Of course it goes without saying that children are poor because their parents are poor. Many poor children live in low-income lone-parent families headed by women, but it has become more acceptable to talk about child poverty than women's poverty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765514">I would like to make special note that according to CCPA, while many people seem to believe women to choose to work part-time or on a temporary basis so they can more easily combine their paid employment with family responsibilities, in 2008 among women in the main childbearing age group, 25 to 44, 27% of those who were employed part-time worked part-time because they were unable to find full-time jobs. About 38% of women in this age group were working part-time because they were caring for children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765515">Women in Canada still have unacceptably high rates of poverty, especially if they are on their own as lone-parent heads of families or as older women living alone. While we used to talk about the feminization of poverty, addressing women's poverty no longer seems to be a high priority among policymakers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765516">The HST is a policy that continues to ignore the feminization of poverty in our country. The worst of it is the tax is inherently regressive. It disproportionately hits those who have no choice but to spend all or a large part of their income and it favours those with income to save. This is doubly true in a recession where less than 50% of the unemployed qualify for EI, where social assistance rates are well below the poverty line and the cost of essentials looms larger and larger.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765517">Those with the lowest income have no choice but to pay the tax and sacrifice consumption elsewhere. The HST is hitting those who can least afford it harder than anyone else. The tax is quite simply unfair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765518"> The Conservatives have demonstrated a callous disregard for the plight of low and moderate income households. They cannot be trusted to apply the HST fairly. It has been argued a sales tax is bad for investment compared with a tax on profits. Then why is the removal of sales tax from inputs not matched by an increase in corporate income taxes? In fact, the opposite is true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765519"> The HST is accompanied by corporate income tax cuts, both at the federal and provincial levels. In other words, the HST is part of a general and indiscriminate tax shift, shifting the burden from corporations to individuals and families without adequate compensation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765520">The claim that it will lower prices assumes businesses will pass along their savings to consumers. Studies show that much less than 100% of the savings are passed on to consumers. Price increases are virtually inevitable. Remember when the GST was introduced? Prices to consumers did not decline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765521">One of the arguments the Conservatives put forward states that because it applies to a wider range of goods, it is more efficient as a generator of revenue and hence, under progressive governments, provides support to high-quality public services. Scandinavian countries depend on HST for much of their revenue. This, of course, does not apply to the current situation because the party in power is far from progressive and it has done nothing but undermine services to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765522">It should be noted that I have refused to call this a government. A government leads with integrity and places the needs of people before its own. A real government would never have done what the Conservatives have done to undermine women's rights, deprive first nations, use the resources of government to mislead and create dissension among its citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765523">Finally, last evening the members across the aisle invoked closure to stifle debate, to force through its undemocratic and unfair tax. It wants, like its <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>, to wash its hands of responsibility for the people of Ontario and British Columbia, just as it washed its hands of its obligations to this nation and to its people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765524">That is a group I cannot call government because, quite simply, it is not.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1765540">What we are entertaining here in our short, limited opportunity to debate this bill is the imposition by the federal government on the provincial governments of Ontario and British Columbia to increase taxes on items that people have to buy for themselves and their children on a daily basis to keep themselves going.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765541">The Retired Teachers of Ontario said it best. They indicated that the HST is basically a tax on daily living. They hit the nail on the head when they said that northerners will be hit with significantly increased heating costs due to long winters. Lighting, water and heating are necessary for survival.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765542">An extra 8% tax on almost all goods and services will be difficult for retirees or for those on a fixed income. There are a lot of people across this province, particularly in northern Ontario and in my own riding of Sault Ste. Marie, who are living on fixed incomes and are already finding it difficult to get by. An extra 8% on the cost of basic necessities that they cannot do without simply will be devastating for them.</ParaText>

I have two children and have them involved in lots of sports and activities, and to be honest, I have very little extra money.

              <ParaText id="1765861">I place those thoughts on the record here this afternoon as symbolic of a larger strong feeling coming out of the Sault Ste. Marie riding about this imposition of the HST in partnership with the provincial Liberal government in that province.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1765868">They tell me that they are stretched to the very limit. There is no place else for them to go.

              <ParaText id="1765869">They cannot pay for the basics in life. They cannot feed themselves and their children with healthy, nutritious food. They cannot pay the rent. They cannot involve their family members in the things they should be able to be involved in to participate in their communities. Another imposition of a further cost to them will be devastating. They are saying they do not know what they will do.</ParaText>

This will end tonight; we will vote on it tomorrow, and ultimately, next July, there will be another 8% added to the cost of some very basic items for ordinary citizens in my riding and across northern Ontario, and for the poor in Ontario and British Columbia. </ParaText>

Today we are witnessing a real lack of democracy, a shortcoming in the approach of the government toward pieces of legislation that very directly affect every man, woman and child in this province and in the province of British Columbia. We are not willing to take the time necessary to hear them and to go through the public consultation process.</ParaText>

Certainly no one in those consultations suggested for a second that we bring in the HST and raise the cost of living for them.</ParaText>

If they look at Bill <Document DbId="4268485" Type="3">C-62</Document>, which is an enabling legislation amending the Excise Tax Act, they will see that there are no clauses to do with the HST, at least none that I could see. There are a number of changes on issues such as the provisions for direct sellers and some other consequential amendments, but there is nothing in here that the public would actually be able to comment on, unless the member is aware of any clause in Bill <Document DbId="4268485" Type="3">C-62</Document> that has something to do with what he was talking about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765880">I suggest to the member that the consultation process with the public has to do with the legislation of the Province of Ontario and the Province of B.C., which are harmonizing their provincial taxes with an existing federal tax.

              <ParaText id="1765887">I rise today to speak against the HST. However, before I do, let me take a moment to say it is an honour for me to stand in the House of Commons, representing the communities of New Westminster, Coquitlam and Port Moody. I am humbled by the trust and faith that voters have recently placed in me. I am committed to building a sustainable community that is socially just, inclusive and economically vibrant. This is why I am so strongly opposed to the harmonized sales tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765888">First, let me tell members about the community I represent and the concerns of the people in New Westminster, Coquitlam and Port Moody.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765889">My riding is made up of three unique communities, bordering the Fraser River and the Pacific Ocean. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765890">New Westminster is British Columbia's first capital city and the oldest city in western Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765891"> Port Moody is the home to the last spike of the transcontinental train track and is known as the city of arts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765892">Coquitlam, the youngest of the three municipalities, is home to one of B.C.'s first francophone communities, Maillardville. It is also known for its green spaces and quality education system. Coquitlam literally means “red fish up the river”, so named by the Kwikwetlem First Nation for the abundant sockeye salmon that historically travelled up the Coquitlam River.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765893">The history of these communities is intertwined with that the Fraser River, through settlement, trade and economic activity, and bound by the environmental attributes of this great river and linked to the salmon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765894">The Fraser River sockeye salmon recently faced one of the most devastating collapses in Canadian history and are in jeopardy of going the way of the Atlantic cod unless immediate action is taken.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765895">This is why I called for an independent public judicial inquiry into the collapse of the Fraser River sockeye salmon. It is also why, as the New Democrat fisheries and oceans critic, I have been actively calling the government to phase out open-net fish farms and move to closed containment; to immediately move existing fish farms away from important wild salmon migration routes; and to invest in habitat protection and salmon enhancement programs to protect our wild salmon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765896">It is no secret that I am incredibly passionate about the fate of British Columbia's wild salmon. This is why I twice swam the length of the 1,400 kilometre Fraser River to draw attention to the negative impacts we have on this mighty river system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765897">I feel so strongly because the demise of our wild salmon is really an indication of the broader problems that my community faces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765898">Homelessness has nearly tripled in the tri-cities and more than doubled in New Westminster since 2005.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765899">We have seen the closure of several mills in our community, and this latest recession has brought some of the highest unemployment in over a decade.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765900">At a time when my community is struggling, at a time when British Columbians need us most, at a time when the world is calling on Canada to take a major role on the international stage in Copenhagen, the government is making life less affordable for students, seniors, families and small businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765901">The HST is more than a new tax on British Columbians; it is a tax shift from big business to B.C. families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765902">What is worse, British Columbians were not given a chance to vote on it provincially. Students, seniors, families, small businesses and working people were not consulted on this new tax, and they are furious with the government about it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765903">I know. I have talked with them. This was the number one issue raised on the doorstep. I have knocked on thousands of doors over the past six months.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="30">(1530)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1765904">For instance, I talked to a family, James and Patty, with two small kids and who live in New Westminster. James has recently lost his job and Patty is now the sole breadwinner in the family. If this tax comes in, they will now have to pay 7% more for clothes and basic items for the family. This means they will have to make tough choices in that household. It means they will have to cut things they need to thrive. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765905">I talked to a student, Angie, who lives in Coquitlam and goes to Simon Fraser University. She told me that another 7% on text books, which are already very expensive, will affect her bottom line. She said that if she wants to do the right thing for the environment and purchase a bicycle, that will be another 7% impacting her bottom line that is already faced with some of the highest ever tuition costs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765906">I talked to Anne, who is a senior in Coquitlam. She told me that another 7% on her strata fees will impact her bottom line. She also said that 7% on taxis to get around will affect her daily choices about what she can and cannot afford.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765907">These are just some of the impacts on hundreds of people I have met over the past month. The HST will hurt people in my community, and when given the chance to voice their opposition to this new tax, constituents in New Westminster, Coquitlam and Port Moody have overwhelmingly rejected it. It will hurt small businesses. It will hurt students and seniors. It will hurt working families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765908">Having grown up in this riding, I have seen our community go through many changes. The mills were working at full capacity in New Westminster. My father worked in one. Young families were buying their first homes in Coquitlam, and residents were able to walk to work in Port Moody. All of that has now changed. Most of the mills in New Westminster are closed. Average housing costs in Coquitlam have spiralled to over three-quarters of a million dollars. Residents in Port Moody now commute across the Lower Mainland to get to work. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765909">What did I hear from constituents? No to HST. Instead, create jobs and increase infrastructure funding in New Westminster. No to the HST. Instead, implement a national affordable housing strategy and help families in Coquitlam. No to the HST. Instead, fund the Evergreen Line and help small businesses in Port Moody. No to the HST. Instead, increase funding for community policing and crime reduction programs. They said no to the HST. Instead, set meaningful targets to reduce emissions, stop climate change and protect our air, green spaces and our waterways. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765910">Today, on day two of the Copenhagen summit on climate change, world leaders are meeting to discuss the most pressing issues facing the planet. People in New Westminster, Coquitlam and Port Moody understand these connections. They see the changes taking place in our community, in our rivers and around the world and they know things are not right. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765911">Not one penny of this new tax will make life better for their families. This tax takes money out of their pockets, the pockets of working people, and puts it right back in the pockets of big corporations. Today I am calling on all parties to listen to the people of British Columbia and, like our mighty Sockeye salmon, to swim against the current and vote no to the HST.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1765931"> The government put its axis of taxes in line with the Liberals and Bloc and proceeded to come in with its closure motion and time allocation procedures to force the bill through before the Christmas holidays, when nobody pays attention, in an effort to save its skin. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765932">The reality is the Conservatives could have saved themselves a lot of grief by simply dealing with the bill in the proper fashion and not draw special attention to it. The bill could have been brought in earlier. They knew months ago they were going to do this.

My guess is there is probably some sort of an understanding, that if the Bloc supports the bill, the government will look more favourably on its negotiations with the Government of Quebec, and Quebec will get the money it feels it should get, which I believe is in the area of $2.6 billion. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1765939">This whole policy has been written and dictated by Bay Street. The Liberals recognize that if they do not do what their Bay Street commanders demand, they will lose potential support and it will bleed to the Conservatives. The Liberal Party is stuck in the middle and, as usual, it tends to fall in behind what Bay Street and the corporate community want.</ParaText>

It seems they remain very slavish to the corporate agenda.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765941"> By the way, we had speeches yesterday from some of my colleagues who have been here longer than I. They pointed out in detail how sad it was that the Reform Party was actually dead across the way and how Preston Manning would be, and must be, totally embarrassed to see how this group operated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765942">He favoured public participation and referendums on taxes and a lot of things. Those members used to support that approach. To have them now sit here and drive this through in the middle of the night, through time allocation and closure, has to be a big embarrassment to him and all that he fought for all those years. That party has come full circle and is basically nothing more than a mature government that has lost most if not all of its ideals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765943">Saskatchewan PCs, under Grant Devine, were the ones who brought in the first harmonized sales tax shortly after the GST was introduced in 1991. We should remember back to those days when Brian Mulroney brought in the GST legislation. At the time, his argument was that it would be revenue neutral. It was to get rid of the existing manufacturers' sales tax, which was a tax hidden from the public, but a tax on manufacturers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765944">It was at a period of time after Ireland, New Zealand and other countries in the world had developed VAT taxes and lowered the manufacturers' sales tax. The idea behind it is to lower the price of one's exports and make them more competitive. When we were growing up, most of us did not know what a kiwi was, but now there are kiwis all over the place in the stores.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765945">When New Zealand got rid of its export taxes, it made the products cheaper to export. That produced some more jobs. Then it put a heavy VAT tax on the public, which could not escape. That was the whole ideology behind it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765946"> Brian Mulroney probably would have been more successful if he had done what previous Liberal governments had done, and that was to make it a hidden tax. However, for some reason, he decided he wanted to make it visible. At the end of the day, that was his undoing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765947">Nevertheless, the GST was brought in. It was a visible tax. The manufacturers' sales tax disappeared. At the end of the day, I do not think it was revenue neutral. That was the claim at the time, but I think it was proven afterward that this was an untruth spoken.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765948">We recall the Liberals saying that they were going to eliminate the GST. In 1993 Jean Chrétien's red book outlined all those famous promises that he made to get rid of the GST and never kept. The Liberals being Liberals, when they were re-elected in 1993, they proceeded to give up on practically every promise in the red book they used so successfully to win election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765949">The point is we have a history in our country of both of those parties being involved together in the whole business of getting the GST implemented originally. As I said, the Saskatchewan PCs brought in the harmonization tax in 1991. Roy Romanow of the NDP won the general election before it could be implemented and did not—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1765974">People watching, people listening, may be wondering why an MP from Manitoba would be getting up to participate in a debate that is so very much focused on two of our provinces. It is with a real concern and it is in solidarity with my colleagues from B.C. and Ontario that I stand to point out that not only is the process by which the government is ramming through and silencing any opportunity for debate a problem but it is really the substance of the harmonized sales tax that is a real problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765975">It is a real problem not just for the people in these two provinces and the provinces that have already had this tax imposed on them but also for provinces like Manitoba, which is the one that has stood up and said no, it is not going to put up with this new tax. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765976">It is about recognizing that Manitoba and other provinces might be, down the line, subjected to even greater pressure if Ontario and B.C. are to accept this tax. It is about joining our voices to say how many ways the process, the substance of this whole harmonized sales tax debate, is flawed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765977">Many of my colleagues have stood in the House, the vast majority of us, time and time again to talk about how this is the wrong tax at the wrong time, something that has great resonance where I come from. Certainly, it is a regressive tax, as we know. Really, it places the burden on consumers at one of the worst times in recent history to bring in a new tax, a new tax that increases taxes on consumable items, items that people cannot go without: food, basic goods, basic services and transactions that average Canadians must make in their daily lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765978">Instead of looking at taxing corporations and private companies that benefit from the labour and the resources in our country, this tax goes after the people who are suffering the most as a result of this recession.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765979">This tax also has a very disproportionate impact on certain parts of our population, and I would like to speak in particular in terms of two areas: students and young people, and aboriginal people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765980">When we talk about students and young people, I am the critic for youth and also post-secondary education. This House has a pretty pathetic record in terms of talking about the challenges that young people face in general, but nowhere is this more the case than the imposition of the HST.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765981">Young people, as we know in the case of this recession, have suffered much but in a very different way than many other generations. While we hear of the great job losses inflicted upon middle aged income earners, it is young people who have not gotten the jobs because they do not exist anymore. It is young people who are the first to be laid off. It is young people who have to put up with increased temporary, part-time, contract work, more than any other generation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765982">To have young consumers take on a tax at a time when they are making even less, when they are living in a much more insecure situation and looking at a very insecure job market, is extremely unfair.</ParaText>

We are seeing an increase of food banks at universities. Now we are going to impose a tax to make it more difficult for students who are already going into debt to achieve an education and contribute to our country. We are making it more difficult for them as a result of the HST.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1765991">It is shameful that first nations, which under the treaty are guaranteed the right to tax exemption in the case of the GST, will no longer have that right in terms of point of sale. It is absolutely horrendous that we are not only seeing a tax being imposed that would wipe away that treaty right, but we are seeing a complete and utter lack of consultation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765992">Have we learned nothing, from the way we work with first nations, regarding the most basic practice of the duty to consult? Chief's organizations in Ontario have been extremely vocal in this area. I had the opportunity to speak with chiefs that I have the honour of representing at the Assembly of First Nations congress yesterday. Many of them were also recognizing that this is a dangerous precedent. I am shocked to hear members of the federal government talk about this matter being up to the provinces when we know that federally it is obligated to work with first nations, obligated to respect treaty rights of which tax exemption at the federal level is most definitely one of them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765993">The challenge is that the substance of the tax does not work, the imposition on many vulnerable people, people who are already struggling to make it through, struggling even more as a result of the recession. We have a situation without consultation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765994">Before I finish I would like to note how proud I am to come from a province like Manitoba where we have an NDP provincial government that has stated clearly why it does not support a harmonized sales tax. It recognizes that it is unfair to the average Manitoban and notes the benefit that it does not provide to people who are struggling to make it by. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1765995">I would hope that across the country we could benefit from voices that are standing just as we are in the House to say no, no to a tax that does not work for Canadians, no to a process that excludes Canadians, and no to something that is going to put us further behind as we try as a country to move forward.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1765999">Mr. Speaker, it has been interesting to watch the Conservatives and their anemic friends over there called the Liberal Party. What they have tried to hide behind is the claim that this is a provincial matter, that this is strictly provincial jurisdiction. Yet this is an attempt to shut down the voices of senior citizens and of people with fixed incomes. If this was just an issue of provincial jurisdiction, then why are members of the Liberal Party, like the member for <Affiliation DbId="128753" Type="2">Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca</Affiliation>, breaking ranks with their leaders? Why are Conservatives wanting to break ranks. We know the member for <Affiliation DbId="128215" Type="2">Surrey North</Affiliation> is certainly concerned about this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766000">If this were simply an issue of provincial jurisdiction, the yahoos in the backbenches would not be afraid of bringing in witnesses. They are afraid to bring in witnesses because they know it will come back to them. They are not standing up for their people. They are not standing up for senior citizens. They know that the only party in the House that is standing up for senior citizens is the New Democratic Party of Canada.</ParaText>

They are ramming through, with closure, a bill that is going to impose on the average family in British Columbia a $2,000 bill. These families are struggling economically. These families are already finding it very difficult to make ends meet. The sorry remnants of the Conservatives and the Liberals are allying together to impose closure on all of those Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766011">In this corner of the House, the NDP is not standing for it. We are speaking out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766012">I want to make it very clear that if people want to exercise their opposition to the HST, then in coming elections or in coming byelections, they should be voting NDP. It is as clear as that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766013">Why is closure being imposed this week? We all saw, the whole country saw, the results of the byelection in <Affiliation DbId="145800" Type="2">New Westminster—Coquitlam</Affiliation>. The Conservatives pumped unlimited resources into that riding. What was normally a barometer riding, the were hoping to take it. The residents of <Affiliation DbId="145800" Type="2">New Westminster—Coquitlam</Affiliation> and Port Moody unequivocally rejected the HST and the Conservative Party on November 9.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766014">If we take those results of <Affiliation DbId="145800" Type="2">New Westminster—Coquitlam</Affiliation> and Port Moody and we put them right across British Columbia, a dozen Conservative MPs will not be back in the next Parliament. That is because British Columbians are speaking with one voice. They are saying “no” to the HST.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766015">What do we see? The Conservatives are now, in one of the most sorry Parliamentary episodes that we have ever seen in our country, imposing closure, imposing a motion and imposing a bill that provides for four hours of so-called committee work, between 7 p.m. and 11 p.m. on a weekday evening. It is absolutely despicable what they are doing to the Canadian public, what they are doing to British Columbians and Ontarians, which is almost half the country, if we take those two populations, by imposing closure and refusing the kind of public participation that we should have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766016">Only the New Democrats are standing in the House, saying that we do not agree. We are going to do everything we can to force the public consultations that the government should be performing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766017">There is no doubt that this plot was hatched by the Conservative government, that it forced the HST on British Columbians and Ontarians. It offered up the so-called bribe money to try to influence those governments. However, in the British Columbia election, which was held on May 12, not a single reference was made to the HST. In fact, the premier at that time said that he was not even considering bringing in the HST. British Columbians may have voted on that basis, but they were fundamentally lied to by B.C. government. There has been no public consultation. There has not even been a vote in the legislature.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766018">For the Conservative government to impose closure on this bill, to impose closure on the HST, is nothing less than an attempt at damage control. The Conservatives have no legitimacy to bring this in. They have no legitimacy, aside from their sorry Liberal allies, to impose this on British Columbians. They are doing it because they are hoping that British Columbians are going to forget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766019">British Columbians are not going to forget. They understand the implications such as $500 for the average British Columbian, $2,000 for the average family of four. This is a tax shift for corporate CEOs who the Conservatives and Liberals seem to love. They just cannot give enough love to corporate CEOs. They will give them whatever they want, regardless of whether it makes sense fiscally or not. However, that massive and irresponsible tax shift has to be paid for and it will be paid by ordinary British Columbians and Ontarians. It is not only bad for the individuals involved, it is not only bad for British Columbia and Ontario families, it is bad for community businesses.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1766020">As these fees go up throughout the whole spectrum of necessary purchases that families make in this country, small businesses will find that their clients have less money to spend. That is why the restaurant industry, dry cleaners, hairdressers and barbers all oppose this incredibly misguided, irresponsible and outrageous tax shift. It does not just hit individuals. It hits community businesses as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766021">We have another sop to foreign companies so the money can go to Houston and the Bahamas, but people and businesses on Main Street in small towns and cities across British Columbia and Ontario will be negatively impacted. Some businesses will go under and some families will lose their homes because, quite frankly, $2,000 breaks the backs of some families that are already suffering because of this recession.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1766028">Nadia is from Burnaby and works in the food service industry. She says, “I am very worried about the impact of the HST on our business. Consumers today don't have money to spare and higher prices will mean fewer customers”.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1766030">Members can laugh about new Canadians opposing the HST, but we are their voice in the House. The government should start listening to ordinary British Columbia and Ontario families and new Canadian families. It should start listening for the first time. It should actually listen to the voices coming from across the country opposing the HST. Rather than invoking closure, what it should be doing is holding public hearings and allowing the real voices of Canadians to be heard. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766031">The NDP has opposed this unfair tax shift not only nationally, but we opposed it in each of the provinces. In Saskatchewan we stopped it cold, rolled it back and abolished the HST. We knew it was bad for ordinary families. In Manitoba we stopped it cold and refused to implement it in Nova Scotia. The new NDP government in Nova Scotia has cut it out on heating fuel because it knows what this means for ordinary families in Nova Scotia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766032">Across the country we oppose the HST. It is unfair to ordinary families, and British Columbians and Ontarians deserve better from the government.</ParaText>

Gas prices in places like Wawa, Manitouwadge, White River, Hornepayne, Elliot Lake, Blind River, Nairn Centre, Kapuskasing, Hearst and Smooth Rock Falls border on the insane and now will be 8% more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766063">There is no recognition from the government that the cost of living in northern Ontario is much higher than in the south, which means that the impact of this tax grab will be disproportionately larger among northerners. Does that seem fair or equitable? Another reason we are against the implementation of the HST is the shirking of Canada's statutory, contractual and common law obligations to consult with first nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766064">First nations will be impacted greatly by the implementation of this blended tax. They are currently some of the most marginalized, vulnerable and poorest people in Canada. In Ontario, the point of sale has proven beneficial for them and their ability to better provide for their families while on very limited incomes. Having gone through years of this kind of treatment at the hands of the federal Liberals, first nations had hoped they would finally get a government that would address these inequities affecting first nations. This is certainly not the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766065">Earlier today, I shared a message from Chief Franklin Paibomsai. For the record, I would like to add a few more of the names of those who sent me similar messages from Birch Island on beautiful Manitoulin Island, these being Kyle McGregor, Gabriel Paul and Valerie McGregor. As mentioned yesterday, Grand Council Chief Patrick "Wedaseh" Madahbee of the Anishinabek First Nation has written government officials to raise objections on behalf of the approximately 52,000 people within 42 first nations communities in Ontario and other first nations people in Ontario. They are outraged by the government's violation of statutory and contractual rights to consultation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766066">I would like to remind the government that it is not only first nations people who will be impacted by the removal of the point of sale tax exemption. Ontario farmers, who are already facing a very difficult time, will also be impacted. Farmers currently present their farm organization card and sign for the exemption. Not under the HST. They will now have to fork out taxes ahead of time and hopefully will receive some of those back at tax time.</ParaText>

The reason it is a real honour is that only occasionally in politics can one discern when a measure that has been proposed by government is roundly disliked and opposed by the population that we come here to represent.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1766123">The other thing is that in a democracy, the people are always right. In this particular case the people are not only right, in that a vast overwhelming majority of people are opposed to it, but they actually understand very well the reasons why this tax is bad policy and is bad for them. I am going to go through some of those reasons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766124"> The number one reason this tax is bad is that it will hurt consumers. Context is everything. Think of the timing. Right now we are in the middle or perhaps the late stages of a recession, when our economy is operating at approximately two-thirds of its effectiveness. Many people are unemployed. Many people are worried about their paycheques. They are worried about their jobs. They are worried about their pensions. Businesses are having trouble as well. What happens? We bring in a tax that is going to shift the tax burden of this country from corporations on to consumers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766125">Putting aside political rhetoric in the House, which is always a difficult thing to do, I have heard members on the other side of the House say that they are the party that champions tax cuts. They say that we are the party that is always in favour of tax increases. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766126">Let us tell the truth about this tax. This tax is a tax increase. The HST represents the addition of a tax on the people of British Columbia. I will tell the House why. While harmonizing the GST with the provincial PST, as that is being implemented by the government , that combined tax is now going to apply to many goods and services that previously were not subject to the PST. That means many dozens and dozens of goods and services in British Columbia that are not subject to the PST will in fact be subject to the PST after July 1, 2010.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766127">I am going to list some of them: restaurant meals and catered foods, snack foods, prepared foods and heated foods, school supplies, taxi fares, movie and theatre tickets, accounting services, veterinary care, classes for yoga, dance, cooking and martial arts, membership fees for clubs and gyms, acupuncture and alternative medicine, haircuts, repairs to home appliances, laundry and drycleaning, carpet and upholstery cleaning, janitorial services, car washes, local residential phone service, basic cable TV service, new homes over $400,000, vitamins, dietary supplements, even the cost of a funeral.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766128">Here is the truth. The truth is that the HST represents a tax increase of 7% on British Columbians on all of those goods and services. My friends opposite do not want to acknowledge that. They just want to ignore that fact and use political rhetoric, but that is the truth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766129">We have to ask ourselves, at a time when Canada is in a recession, when middle and working class families across the country, particularly in British Colombia are struggling to stay ahead, is this the time that we should be making a comprehensive list of goods and services, like the one I just read out, more expensive? I do not think so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766130">Number two, this tax is going to hurt business. It is not just me who is saying this. I have gone to public fora in British Columbia and I have heard representatives from organizations as diverse as the British Columbia Restaurant and Foodservices Association, the British Columbia Real Estate Association and representatives of small business associations of every type. They have made it very clear that the HST is bad for their business. It is bad for small business. Why? They know that the consumers that they count on to patronize their businesses and keep them healthy will not be able to do so in the future to the same degree that they are doing now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766131">The government has talked about how the HST will reduce paperwork. Yes, it may in fact do that. It may reduce certain inputs. Yes it may in fact do that. However, the very best measure one can take for a business and what businesses depend on is having customers. Measures that actually attack a customer base, and these are the types of retail businesses that count on healthy customer bases, will suffer as a result of the HST. That is a bad thing for our country.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1766132">Number three, this tax represents an unfair tax shift. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766133">Again, if we put all politics aside and just tell the truth about tax policy in this country over the last 20 years, the numbers are absolutely clear. There has been a complete tax shift from corporations on to individuals. That is a fact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766134">Members in this House who want to dispute that should bring forward their numbers and let us have a debate on that. But that is the truth. It represents a philosophy that I say is outmoded, that began in the early 1980s with Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. It is trickle down economics, where if the tax burden on large corporations is reduced, then what they will do is magically cut their prices and those benefits will flow right down to the consumer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766135">Let us look at the evidence. Over the last 25 years in North America, and Canada in particular, the inequality gap between the wealthy and the poor has grown dramatically. The proposed so-called benefits of giving tax breaks to the wealthy and large corporations because that will trickle down to all of us has not materialized. In fact, it has been the exact opposite, just as New Democrats said would happen in the early 1980s, and we say it again in 2009.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766136">Number four, this tax is a regressive tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766137">What is a regressive tax? A regressive tax is applied to someone regardless of the person's income. On July 2, 2010, a poor, single mother will walk into a store in British Columbia and she will pay the same 12% tax on a good that a billionaire walking into that store will pay. That is unfair. It is bad economic policy, but most of all, it is unjust. That 12% to a person making $22,000 a year represents a much larger percentage of the person's income than that 12% does for someone making $300,000 a year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766138">The Conservative government, of course, carrying on the tradition started by the previous Liberal government, has presided over the flattening of our tax system, the regressing of our tax system over the last 25 years. It has made Canada a much more unfair and a much more unequal place today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766139">We cannot sit and ignore the reality that people make less in real dollars today. Middle-class earners or working-class earners make less money in 2009 than they did in 1999. That is not progress. However, I can say that large corporations and the wealthy make disproportionately more money today than they did in 1999. That is a tragedy for our country. It is going in the wrong direction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766140">The fifth reason that this tax is a bad idea is that it is born of dishonesty. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766141">I was in British Columbia in May 2009 when journalists asked Premier Gordon Campbell directly, “Are you considering bringing in an HST?” I was in British Columbia when the minister of finance in British Columbia, a member of the Liberal Party, was asked whether the party was considering bringing in an HST. What did they say? They said, “No”. That is an act of political dishonesty. If it is such a good idea to bring in an HST, if there are arguments that they think will convince the majority of the population that it is a good policy and should be brought in, why did they not have the guts to talk about it?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766142">That dishonesty has been compounded by the federal government. I sit in this House every day and watch as the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> stands and says that this is just a provincial issue, that it is not the federal government.</ParaText>

In fact, an article by the Canadian Press in <I>The Chronicle Journal</I> in Thunder Bay on December 4 says that the Ontario aboriginal affairs minister stated that “the province supports demands for a point-of-sale exemption for first nations and is urging Ottawa to get behind the move.

This is not a time, when Canadians are already struggling to make ends meet, when people are worried about their jobs and seniors and pensioners are worried about being able to make their payments on their rent, on their medications, on their food. This is just the wrong time to pass on an additional cost to them. This is simply a tax shift from businesses, but not from all businesses. We have heard that this will not help the service sector out at all. However, there is an overall tax shift from the business sector to consumers. This is not the time to pass on those costs to consumers in British Columbia and Ontario.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1766237"> moved that Bill <Document DbId="3969852" Type="4">C-442, An Act to establish a National Holocaust Monument</Document>, be read the second time and referred to a committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766238"> He said: Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce my private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="3969852" Type="4">C-442, An Act to establish a National Holocaust Monument</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766239">As a student growing up in Edmonton, I learned about the history of the Holocaust as part of the second world war. Textbooks recount the events that unfolded, the battles that were waged, the sacrifices of our soldiers, airmen and sailors, along with their families, and the eventual victory of the allies over the Nazis. I also learned about the Holocaust, how groups of people who did not fit certain stereotypes were exterminated in the name of racial purity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766240">However, as a student reading from a textbook, those events seemed distant and dated. They happened before I was born, to people I did not know much about, in countries on the other side of the world. I had only a superficial understanding of the Holocaust. It was a part of history. It was something I learned about but never truly understood or appreciated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766241">For young people today, it is even more remote. Privileged to live in a country like Canada, the Holocaust can seem totally foreign, something which people have difficulty understanding because they cannot relate to the atrocities and horrors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766242">For some, a deeper understanding of those terrible events is provided through the stories and retelling of family members and veterans who were witness to the Holocaust, and in some cases, survived it. Elie Wiesel and Branko Lustig have done much to remind us of what they experienced. However, as time passes and the ranks of those who are able to tell those stories dwindle, there comes a danger that this unparalleled crime will become just a part of history, something which may exist in a textbook but whose real significance is lost. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766243">In a way, it is a tribute to the progress we have made that our children have difficulty understanding this brutality. Today's Canada is a nation of hope and opportunity, a beacon to those around the world seeking to find a new home and brighter future for themselves and their families. As Canadians, we pride ourselves on a nation that values and demands respect toward other people, affords a personal dignity to all people and provides an environment of tolerance and understanding. Our society is the dream for many around the world and is something that the thousands of men and women in our armed forces have fought for in distant, war-torn and oppressed nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766244">My own parents came to Canada in order to take advantage of all that Canada affords to newcomers and we remain deeply grateful toward this country that values its new Canadians as positive assets to our national identity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766245">Today's Canada and those who are honoured to call Canada home would have tremendous difficulty identifying with the deep horrors of the Holocaust. The concept of state-sanctioned killing and ethnic cleansing is completely alien. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766246">The dangers we as a country now face are complacency and fatigue, to allow things like the Holocaust to rest in the pages of history. To do so, invites a return to the terror of those dark years, and losing those very things which we hold most dear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766247">We must remember that just because no crime so horrible has occurred in Canada does not mean we need not concern ourselves. After all, the history of our country is not perfect: the internment of Japanese Canadians; the events surrounding the <I>Komagata Maru</I> incident; and the treatment of aboriginal Canadians. We should not pretend that crimes against whole groups of people are something that only ever happen far away and long ago. Time and time again our government has urged vigilance and for people to learn the lessons of history so we never find ourselves ignoring the signs of trouble.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766248">And lest we think that hatred and anti-Semitism are relics of the past, we are reminded on an almost daily basis that there are individuals around the world who continue to deny the very existence of the Holocaust, or who seek to downplay the extent of the crimes that were committed against humanity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766249">President Ahmadinejad of Iran continues to outrage people with his denial of the Holocaust. His myopic and ignorant comments on the subject of the Holocaust have resulted in condemnation from virtually all quarters of the world, but there are people even in our country who agree with him.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="50">(1750)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1766250">The denial of the Holocaust and those who voice such opinions must continue to be fought in the public square. This monument will be a testament to where Canada stands.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766251">Others have not been so vocal and public with their hatred, but have cloaked their denial of the Holocaust behind a veneer of claiming respect for human rights. The rise of anti-Semitism in some places around the world, whether overt or subtle, is another compelling reason why Canada must continue to ensure that the Holocaust is both acknowledged and condemned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766252">As a member of Parliament, I am privileged to represent the citizens of Edmonton—Sherwood Park in Ottawa. In my opinion, members of Parliament are charged with two important roles: fighting for the interests of their constituents; and pursuing issues which will benefit Canada as a whole. I believe that establishing a national Holocaust monument speaks to both of these roles and will help to instill in generations of future Canadians an understanding of the atrocities of the Holocaust through a visible, tangible icon in the nation's capital.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766253">Some people have suggested that a monument is not necessary. After all, who has not heard of the Holocaust, they say. Do we really need a monument? I believe that yes, yes we do. Remember, after the second world war was over, people began speaking about the Holocaust. Newspapers printed the crimes that had been committed, but they were not fully understood or appreciated. No one really grasped what happened. It was not until we saw the photographs, until there was a more tangible and visible way to understand, that the significance of the Holocaust began to sink in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766254">This is why I believe that reading about the Holocaust in a textbook is not enough. Every year there are thousands of Canadians who come to visit our capital, many of them schoolchildren. A physical, tangible monument, given space in our nation's capital, will make a different impression than the words they read on a page.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766255">Like many, I was surprised to learn that Canada remained the only allied nation without a Holocaust monument in its nation's capital. As it is the case in these other countries, with the passage of time there are fewer and fewer survivors who can bear the personal witness to the Holocaust.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766256">A permanent monument to those who died in concentration camps or in their own homes at the hands of the Nazis will serve as a lasting reminder of a dark era of hatred and violence that we must ensure never occurs again. By placing the monument in the nation's capital, at the seat of government, we accord an appropriate respect and acknowledge the gravity of this terrible event. Great Britain, the United States, France, all our allies have understood the importance of remembering the Holocaust, and so should Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766257">I would like to express my sincere appreciation to those who have made fighting anti-Semitism, bigotry and racism their cause, and in doing so, have helped make our nation and our world a better place. In particular, I would like to extend my deepest appreciation to the men and women of the armed forces who continue to battle extremism and uphold our values of freedom and justice around the world. As Canadians, we owe them a tremendous debt which we can never repay.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766258">I have been thrilled with the broad level of support I have received to establish a national Holocaust monument, both from my colleagues in the House and from organizations throughout Canada, specifically Laura Grosman from the Canadian Holocaust Memorial Project, senior parliamentarians such as the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128189" Type="2">Mount Royal</Affiliation> and the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128203" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation>, along with a number of my colleagues in the Conservative caucus, and in particular, the hon. <Affiliation DbId="128722" Type="4">Minister of State for Foreign Affairs</Affiliation>. They have been strong supporters of moving this initiative forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766259">I see this bill as an example of the best of what Parliament can do when we transcend traditional party lines and move forward on an issue of tremendous importance to Canadians. I would urge all hon. members to support this legislation. Let our commitment to remembering those who died in the Holocaust and those who continue to be confronted with anti-Semitism be represented by a visible, concrete reminder of that dark time. Let it stand as a testament to our own ideals and values and be the embodiment of the words and stories inscribed in the textbooks of history, read but not fully appreciated.</ParaText>

This council will be responsible for the design of the monument, arranging or putting together the funds for it as well, and for raising funds throughout Canada, through the community. I definitely believe it will be well beyond just the Jewish community. I think Canadians in general would be very eager and willing to support this monument.</ParaText>

In remembrance of Holocaust victims, in recognition of survivors, in tribute to those who fought so that we may live and that our values may endure, and in order to ensure, as the preamble to the act puts it, our collective resolve never to forget, so that never again will not only be a matter of rhetoric but will be a matter of resolve and commitment to act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1777008">I am now citing from the preamble: to ensure that the Holocaust continues to have a permanent place in our nation’s consciousness and memory; to forever remind Canadians of one of the darkest chapters in human history and of the dangers of state-sanctioned hatred and anti-Semitism; and to ensure that future generations learn about the root causes of the Holocaust and its consequences in order to help prevent future acts of genocide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1777009">Such is how the preamble speaks and this frames my support. I must say that whenever I speak on the subject-matter related to the Holocaust, I do so with a certain degree of humility and not without a deep sense of pain, for I have neither the wisdom of the Holocaust scholar nor the horrifying experience of the Holocaust survivor. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1777010">But I am reminded of what my parents taught me while I was still a young man, the profundity and pain of which I only realized years later, that there are things in Jewish history, in human history, that are too terrible to be believed but are not too terrible to have happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1777011">Oswiecim, Majdanek, Dachau, Treblinka, these are beyond vocabulary. Words may ease the pain, but they also can dwarf the tragedy. For the Holocaust was uniquely evil in its genocidal singularity, where biology was inescapably destiny, a war against the Jews in which Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Laureate Elie Wiesel put it, “not all victims were Jews, but all Jews were victims”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1777012">As it happens, we meet at an important moment of remembrance and reminder, of witness and warning appropriate that we should be, in fact, speaking to this issue now of establishing a national monument to the Holocaust. We meet on the eve of the 60th anniversary of the Nuremberg Principles, the double entendre of Nuremberg, the Nuremberg of hate, the Nuremberg of jackboots, as well as the Nuremberg of judgments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1777013">On the eve of the 61st anniversary of the Genocide Convention, which we will be commemorating tomorrow, as it happens, sometimes spoken of as the “Never Again Convention”, but which has been violated again and again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1777014">On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the second world war, in fact, there were indeed two wars at the time. There was the Nazi war against the Allies and there was the Nazi war against the Jews, and where the Nazi war against the Jews sometimes overtook the Nazi war against the Allies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1777015">We meet on the 70th anniversary of the doomed voyage of the <I>St. Louis</I> known as “the voyage of the damned” where those who sought to enter our country Canada and those who sought to enter the United States at the time were turned away, so that those seeking a safe haven were forced back into the inferno that was engulfing Europe. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1777016">This came a year after the Evian Conference when the nations of the world met to ask themselves what to do about the plight of the Jewish refugees at the time, of those living and wishing to leave. It ended up that the world was divided into two parts: those countries from which the Jews could not leave or indeed could not live in, and those that they could not enter which took us down the road to the Holocaust.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1777017">And so, on this anniversary of anniversaries, we should ask ourselves: What have we learned? What must we do? And why is this national Holocaust monument so important for that learning and for those lessons?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1777018">For reasons of time, I will share only two, and if time permits, three, lessons which the establishment of this Holocaust monument will serve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1777019">Number one is the importance of Zachor, of the duty of remembrance itself. For as we remember six million Jews themselves defamed, demonized and dehumanized, as prologue or justification for the Holocaust, we have to understand that the mass murder of six million Jews and the mass murder of the millions of non-Jews is not a matter of statistics. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1777020">As we say on the occasion of the national Holocaust remembrance ceremony that this Parliament itself enacted as a bill for that purpose, as we say at that time and as we should say again today, unto each person, each person has a name. Each of the victims had an identity. Each one was a universe. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1777021">As our sages teach us, if we save a single person, it is as if we have saved an entire universe, but if we kill a single person, it is as if we have killed an entire universe. And so, the overriding imperative which should always govern us and which underpins this national Holocaust monument is that we are each, wherever we are, the guarantors of each other's destiny.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1777022">That brings me to the second lesson; that is, the dangers of state-sanctioned incitement to hate and to genocide, that the enduring lesson of the Holocaust and the genocides that followed, in Srebrenica, Rwanda and Darfur, occurred not simply because of the machinery of death but because of state-sanctioned cultures of hate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1777023">It was this teaching of contempt, this demonizing of the other, where it all began.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1777024"> As our Supreme Court of Canada put it in words echoed by the international criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, “The Holocaust did not begin in the gas chambers--it began with words”. These, as the court put it, are the chilling facts of history. These, as the court put it, are the catastrophic effects of racism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1777025"> And tragically, we are witnessing yet again, in our own time, a state-sanctioned incitement to hate and genocide whose epicentre is Ahmadinejad's Iran. I say Ahmadinejad's Iran because I want to distinguish that from the people in Iran who are otherwise the targets of mass domestic repression. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1777026">Let there be no mistake about it. Iran has already committed the crime of incitement to genocide prohibited under the Genocide Convention. Iran is already in standing violation of international prohibitions against the production and development of nuclear weapons, along with prohibitions respecting crimes against humanity which are being committed regarding Iranian citizens as we meet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1777027">And so, the second lesson, namely, the dangers of state-sanctioned incitement to hate takes us down the road to genocide, as we have seen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1777028">In fact, may I make reference to the unspeakable genocide in Rwanda? I say “unspeakable” because nobody can say that we did not know. We knew, but we did not act. Just as nobody can say, with respect to Darfur, that we did not know. We knew and we did not act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1777029">This brings me to the last lesson: the dangers of indifference and inaction in the face of such incitement and mass atrocity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1777030">This monument will be a monument to remember, a monument to remind us. It will be an act of remembrance. It will be, also, a remembrance to act so that never to forget, which is underpinning this monument, will be translated into never again.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1766297">Mr. Speaker, the Bloc Québécois supports Bill <Document DbId="3969852" Type="4">C-442, An Act to establish a National Holocaust Monument</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766298">The Holocaust was one of the worst crimes of the 20th century. The Bloc Québécois therefore supports the bill to commemorate both the survivors and the victims. We believe that we must commemorate the victims of the Holocaust, but we also believe that we must continue the fight against anti-Semitism and all other forms of hate speech and discrimination. We have done so in the past, and we intend to continue that fight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766299">Anti-Semitism and all other forms of hate speech are contrary to the values of Quebec and Canada. They must be denounced publicly, without hesitation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766300">The Bloc Québécois has always acted to secure social peace and a public space without hatred, discrimination or violence. That fight is crucial for any society that claims to be democratic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766301">The purpose of the bill is to create a national monument in Ottawa to honour the victims and Canadian survivors of the Holocaust. To that end, Bill C-442 creates the National Holocaust Monument Development Council, whose five members will be selected by the federal government from a list of volunteer candidates. Candidates will have to show that they have a strong interest in and familiarity with the Holocaust. The council members will not be entitled to any remuneration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766302">The <Affiliation DbId="128696" Type="4">Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities</Affiliation>, who is responsible for the National Capital Act, and the monument development council would supervise the monument's design and planning. They would also select an appropriate parcel of public land in Canada's national capital region, where the monument would be erected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766303">While the minister is tasked with designating the public land, the council would be responsible for a fundraising campaign to pay for the monument's construction. It must be completed within three years of Bill C-442 receiving royal assent. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766304">When we think of the Holocaust, the first images that come to mind are images of horror. All of us have seen pictures of the concentration camps that shocked the entire world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766305">In the wake of the political and economic crisis that hit Germany after World War I, the National Socialist German Workers' Party singled out the Jews and blamed them for all Germany's troubles. They became scapegoats and the worst lies were fabricated about them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766306">It is estimated that about three quarters of Europe's Jews were massacred by the Nazis, representing approximately 40% of the world's Jewish diaspora. Six million Jews died under the Nazi regime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766307">This mass murder was implemented by the Hitler regime, as well as by a number of bureaucrats of the Third Reich and many collaborators, both individuals and states. In addition to Jews, the Nazis also massacred gypsies, homosexuals, disabled people and Slavs from Poland or Soviet countries.<Sup /></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766308">After the war, faced with the horror of the crime that had been committed by Germany, governments the world over agreed to incorporate into international law the crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. These crimes have no equivalent in terms of their gravity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766309">The purpose of Bill C-442 is to establish a monument to serve as a reminder of this crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766310">The Bloc Québécois is in favour of establishing a monument to commemorate the Holocaust. Such a monument would serve as a constant reminder of the violence inherent in intolerance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766311">In order to preserve a public space of freedom and democracy, we have to fight against intolerance here at home. We cannot remain silent before words or actions that are anti-Semitic, homophobic, sexist or racist and that aim at discriminating against fellow citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766312">We cannot help but be concerned when people are targeted and become victims of discrimination because of their religion, and more generally, their ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation or language.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766313">Canada is not immune. According to Statistics Canada, Canada's police forces have indicated that 785 crimes in 2007 were hate crimes. That was a decline over 2006 when 892 such offences were reported. Of those crimes committed in 2007, 185 were religious hate crimes. Again, that was a decline over the 220 cases reported in 2006.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766314">This data shows a slight decrease in the number of hate crimes, which is good news. Nonetheless, the fact remains that such acts still take place, even though they are unacceptable in democratic societies like Quebec and Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1766315">One religious hate crime is one too many. There must be zero tolerance. We must work on putting an end to such crimes. We cannot remain silent, on the sidelines or attempt to downplay the situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766316">We must oppose anti-Semitism and racism. Anti-Semitism stems from profound ignorance. Thus, education is the most effective way to oppose it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766317">We believe that we must raise awareness and foster dialogue to build a Quebec that is even more inclusive and respectful of all its citizens. Priority must be given to education and prevention in order to eradicate beliefs and activities based on hatred.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766318">Funds from anti-racism programs must be first allocated to groups that are victims of racism and hate crimes. All too often, acts of hatred target children in schools. These children very regrettably learn about violence or hatred motivated by race or religion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766319">In an effort to effectively combat anti-Semitism and all other forms of racism, the Bloc Québécois member for <Affiliation DbId="128171" Type="2">Châteauguay—Saint-Constant</Affiliation> presented a concrete proposal in April 2008: she introduced Bill <Document DbId="3627234" Type="4">C-384</Document>, which was passed at second reading. This bill amended the Criminal Code and created a new offence to prohibit hate-motivated acts of mischief that target specific identifiable groups at institutions such as schools, daycare centres, colleges, universities, community centres, playgrounds, skating rinks and sports centres or any administrative, social, cultural, educational or sports establishment used exclusively or mainly by such groups. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766320">The creation of this offence sends a clear message and reaffirms that society does not tolerate acts of violence against places attended or used by identifiable groups.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766321">This bill—now law—sends the message that violence motivated by hate of a group or community is not tolerated. The specific offence allows us to denounce not only the material damage to a building, for example, but also, and above all, the fact that hatred of an identifiable group, which is the cause of the act, is morally wrong. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766322">Such crimes fly in the face of the values of Quebeckers and the society we wish to create for ourselves. These crimes only increase tensions between members of our society. That is why we must do everything we can, still in line with our own values, in order to prevent such acts from ever happening again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766323">The bill introduced by my colleague, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128171" Type="2">Châteauguay—Saint-Constant</Affiliation>, is already receiving support from minority groups in Quebec and Canada. For instance, the Canadian Jewish Congress sees this bill as an appropriate response to the concerns of the Jewish community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766324">The Bloc Québécois recognizes the importance of the fight against discrimination and hate crimes. Such acts go completely against the core values that drive Quebec and our party, which always represents the interests of Quebeckers here in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766325">The Bloc Québécois has always opposed anti-Semitism and all other hate crimes, which fly in the face of the values of the Quebec nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766326">What kind of shared values are we talking about? It is becoming increasingly necessary to remind people of the shared values on which the Quebec identity is based. The most important values, those that form the foundation of our nation, would, we think, include the following: gender equality—and it is no accident that that is at the top of the list; French as the official language and common public language; democracy; basic human rights; secularism; pluralism; and so on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766327">In closing, all citizens of Quebec have the same rights. Quebec citizenship is inclusive and unifying. It transcends differences by promoting a collective identity that focuses on civic identity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766328">In that regard, the monument in question, to be built outside of Quebec, in no way contradicts the values of Quebeckers, and the Bloc Québécois will be pleased to vote in favour of this bill.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1766329">Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to participate in the debate on Bill <Document DbId="3969852" Type="4">C-442</Document>, sponsored by the member for <Affiliation DbId="128297" Type="2">Edmonton—Sherwood Park</Affiliation>. I am honoured because this is a significant presentation to the House and one that ought to be adopted unanimously. In fact, I wish our procedures would allow us to seek the unanimous consent of the House to pass the bill at all stages and ensure that it becomes law immediately. I know it has to go through a process, and I understand there are some technical amendments that have to be made, but the essence of the bill is something very basic, something very fundamental around which there can be no disagreement, and that is the establishment of a national Holocaust memorial.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766330">It is interesting that it was about six years ago this month that the House came together with all parties agreeing to a bill to establish a national Holocaust memorial day. With that bill and this bill today, the best has been brought out in people in this place. We have come together across party lines and we have done something important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766331">Today is a historic moment when together we resolve to deal with the fact that we are the only country among the allies from World War II that has not yet established a national Holocaust memorial in its capital. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766332">We have heard about the range of memorials that exist around the world. I found it fascinating that there are many that form the basis for the establishment of such a memorial here in Ottawa. Just to name a few, there is the Ani Ma'amin Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem, the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam, Netherlands, the Auschwitz Jewish Center in Poland, the Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service and the Beth Shalom Holocaust Centre in England, the Holocaust Memorial Center in Budapest, the Cape Town Holocaust Centre, Centre de la mémoire d'Oradour in France, the Dallas Holocaust Museum and Center for Education and Tolerance, the Forests of the Martyrs in Jerusalem, the Ghetto Fighters' House in Israel, the Holocaust History Project in Detroit. The list goes on and on. I have named but a few of the memorials that exist in other parts of the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766333">It is truly amazing that we do not have such a Holocaust memorial right here in Canada's capital city. Tonight with this bill we are actually making a significant attempt at redressing an oversight. I hope that we can accomplish this quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766334">The purpose of the memorial is no different from the bill establishing the national memorial Holocaust remembrance day. It is two-fold. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766335">The first purpose is to remember the horrors of the past, the six million Jews who were killed, who were slaughtered, who were sent to the gas chambers by Hitler in Nazi Germany in World War II. It is a chapter in our history that must never be forgotten. It is in the establishment of a memorial that we have another way of remembering that sorry chapter in the history of our society. It is another way of ensuring that we never forget that horror that should never, ever be repeated. That is the fundamental reason for such a memorial.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766336">The second purpose is to remind ourselves that apart from the Holocaust, the motivating factors behind the Holocaust, the hatred of Jewish people, the anti-Semitism, the discrimination, the vile nature of attitudes toward people of Jewish faith is repeated today, every day, in incidents that are increasing from accounts by many in our society. They must be part of our discussions today. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="25">(1825)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1766337">I am very pleased that I am part of a parliamentary coalition to combat anti-Semitism. That is an organization of all-party members in this House determined to come together to try to grasp the nature of anti-Semitism and to understand how we can stop the spread of it, and how we can actually ensure that people live in our society with a sense of freedom and security and identity without discrimination, without living under any kind of hatred or discriminatory attitudes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766338">It is an important initiative in Parliament, but it is one that is certainly in question today because of the fact that so much controversy has happened around mailings from Conservative members slandering Liberal members, accusing them in the most inappropriate way of anti-Semitism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766339">That has put a cloud over these hearings and in fact has given us all cause for concern. We are hoping that this sorry chapter here in Parliament can be resolved, that the cloud can be lifted and in fact that public apologies can be made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766340">I want to ensure that we continue with those hearings because we need to be able to say to Canadians that anti-Semitism in any shape or form is wrong. That does not mean, as we have said in our committee over and over again, that criticism of the State of Israel is anti-Semitic in any shape or form, or that constraints can be put on that debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766341">However, we have to be sure at all times that we are in fact not giving audience to people allowing them to take this debate and to make broad or sweeping statements about a people suggesting in any way, shape or form that the Jewish people of this country or around the world do not have a right to their homeland, that being the State of Israel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766342">This is a difficult topic and a major issue before us today. I think the bill before us actually helps us to remember what we are here for and why it is important to stand up and say, “We will not tolerate any form of anti-Semitism, or hatred or discrimination against anyone because of their sex, or race, or faith.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766343">I know that time is limited, but I want to say that it is imperative that all of us in the House go back to our respective communities and speak about the need to stop anti-Semitism and hatred of any shape or form.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766344">I want to reference the work that is happening in Winnipeg, in particular the work by the Jewish Federation of Winnipeg. It is a force, a committee, an organization that is vigilant on a daily basis to ensure there is awareness that the very purpose, the very reason, for the solidarity of our community in Winnipeg is not being threatened by signs of anti-Semitism and a regular occurrence of incidents of hatred that have to be stopped.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766345">In fact, in a recent brief to one of our committee hearings on anti-Semitism, the Jewish Federation of Winnipeg clearly documented a number of incidents that are hateful and growing and must be stopped.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766346">I will conclude by citing the words of the Jewish Federation of Winnipeg to describe their concerns and why this bill is so important and why it is important we are vigilant every step of the way. The federation states: </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1766359">Last summer, with my mother and a good friend of mine, I visited a student rabbi. For some 30 years he has been a friend of my family. I visited his synagogue on Long Island and I learned a lot about the Jewish people who call Israel their home. It was quite impressive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766360">I must also acknowledge that a number of associations and centres across Canada are dedicated to remembering the Holocaust. I certainly would be remiss if I did not also mention the recently established Canadian Museum for Human Rights, which will allow people to learn about the values of democracy, freedom, human rights and the rule of law, and indeed to remember such atrocities. Democracy, freedom, human rights and the rule of law are the things we stand up for in Canada and the things we try to spread around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766361">I am very proud to say that I believe this particular museum was made possible in no small part by today's <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. Our government is very excited that this new museum broke ground in December 2008. While there are official plaques and monuments in Manitoba, Alberta and Ontario, it is indeed unfortunate, as the member suggested, that a federal memorial commemorating this very bleak period in our world's history of humankind does not exist in Canada's capital.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766362">For these reasons, our government fully supports the intent of Bill <Document DbId="3969852" Type="4">C-442</Document>, and I am very confident that all members in the House would also agree that the ultimate objective of Bill C-442 is definitely justified and long overdue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766363">While I am sure all parties in both Houses of Parliament will certainly be in favour of this bill, I hope that the bill will also receive royal assent and that the national capital region will be graced with a national Holocaust monument in its midst. I am hopeful of that, as I think all members in the House are, but before arriving at that final stage, other events would have to transpire.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766364">Of course, the minister would be expected to actively seek the interest of Canadians who would be willing to contribute their time and energy to this undertaking, but I am certain that a host of individuals would be interested in pursuing this endeavour and would together have a very positive impact on the realization of a national Holocaust monument and the content of it. I am looking forward to it, as I think most Canadians are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766365">Regarding the exact placement of the monument, the National Capital Commission has already established an inventory of potential sites. In accordance with its mandate and policies, the commission would identify appropriate sites from this inventory in consultation with the council. The commission would also approve the final design of the monument, with the construction phase commencing shortly thereafter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766366">Bill <Document DbId="3969852" Type="4">C-442</Document> proposes to create a new council that would be responsible for spearheading a fundraising campaign for a Holocaust monument that would be established in this region. We suggest that it would not take very long to do so, because this is remembered by Canadians, and it is very important indeed to remember it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766367">With the pooling of the talents and resources of various stakeholder groups and committed individuals, the establishment of a national Holocaust monument in our national capital is feasible. I look forward to visiting it in a few short years, as I think many Canadians do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766368">Along with the many supportive actions by this government, our entire cabinet and our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128297" Type="2">Edmonton—Sherwood Park</Affiliation> has outlined many good reasons for this bill to proceed. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1766369">Indeed, I urge all members of this House to vote in favour of this important and necessary bill, just as I urge all members of the other place to do the same. Hopefully we will receive royal assent in due course thereafter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766370">This memorial will serve to forever remind Canadians and all visitors to this great country and this capital of one of the darkest periods and unimaginable genocides in recent history, so we do not forget and it never happens again.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1766371">Mr. Speaker, I had not anticipated speaking because I did not know the bill was up tonight, but I am very pleased to have an opportunity to speak to it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766372">As it happens, I have a bill on the order paper that is virtually the same as this one. Unfortunately, I am much further down on the list and do not have the opportunity to present it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766373">I want to speak to this bill because I think it is very important. As one of the proposers of the Holocaust memorial day here on the Hill, I think it is a natural conclusion that there be a permanent memorial.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766374">As members are undoubtedly aware, there are hearings going on in this building that deal with anti-Semitism in Canada. An all-party coalition is looking at the issue of anti-Semitism. Just yesterday we heard a very important discussion on the importance of remembering the Holocaust, how important the Holocaust is, not only for defining the history of the Jewish people but also for speaking to the atrocities that man is capable of and, as we heard earlier tonight, to say never again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766375">This is an important initiative. It is important that all parties and all members in the House support it. However, I want to digress a little. We heard a member opposite speak of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights in Winnipeg, which is an important initiative in this country. The original capital funding of $100 million promised by the previous Liberal government is fully supported by the current government, which I applaud, as is the ongoing operating funding making it a national museum.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766376">However, the important issue is that the genesis of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights in Winnipeg was that it would be a Holocaust museum. There was much discussion over it and much input from a whole host of communities as to whether it should be a Holocaust museum or indeed a museum of human rights, as it is now established.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766377">It is equally important that there be a permanent Holocaust gallery in the Canadian Museum for Human Rights. It was the vision of the late Israel Asper in promoting this museum. It was the basis upon which many private sector donors made their contributions to it. I think that however we acknowledge and look at the Holocaust, whether through the Holocaust Memorial Day or through a permanent remembrance of the Holocaust on the grounds of this building, as we have on the grounds of the legislative buildings in Manitoba, or a permanent museum in the Canadian Museum for Human Rights, every one of them is equally important and must be sustained.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766378">I am pleased to have had the opportunity to speak however briefly, and I am hopeful that all members of all parties will see fit to support this. It is something that it is important, not just to acknowledge what happened in the past, but, as we have heard elsewhere tonight, to ensure that our children know what happened and will determine that it will never happen again in the future.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1766385">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be back here. I have spoken on this issue before in previous late shows and I am back again in response to questions I have asked before. I want to underline the importance of what I am saying, the importance to many groups in Canada and, I would submit, the importance to many Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766386">I want to acknowledge the Sisters in Spirit initiative of the Native Women's Association of Canada. It was launched by a Liberal government in 2005 and supported ongoing by the current Conservative government. It is an initiative that has brought forth the issue of the more than 520 missing and murdered aboriginal women and girls in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766387">Before this initiative, Canadians did not have much knowledge of this issue. They did not know about the tragedy that had been mounting over the past 30 years. Because of the important work of Sisters in Spirit and so many other grassroots organizations, the national disgrace is now part of the public dialogue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766388">More than 223 of the 520 recorded cases have happened since the year 2000. That is 43% in the last nine years. These cases are all over the country. It is not a provincial problem. It is a national problem and it is one that needs to be addressed by the federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766389">To date, since we on this side of the House have raised the issue and called for a national, public and comprehensive investigation into the matter, it has been the provinces that have taken up leadership on the issue. Manitoba announced a joint task force with the RCMP and Winnipeg Police Service on this matter earlier this fall. Alberta has an initiative to look into the disappearances which have happened in that province. The province of British Columbia is launching its own inquiry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766390">These inquiries should not be left up to the provinces. These cases are national in scope. Many of the girls could have been trafficked, or have been trafficked, across borders and may be in other provinces and perhaps even in other countries, yet the federal government chooses not to take action on this critical problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766391">Last year at the United Nations peer review, Canada was denounced for not taking any action on this matter. The council gave the government an opportunity to respond with a deadline of November this year. That deadline has come and gone and now we hear the government will reply some time later this year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766392">Why is it not taking this issue seriously? Why is it not giving it pre-eminent attention? What will it take and how many more women have to go missing?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766393">I know the government's response will talk about the work of Sisters in Spirit. I applaud the initiative of Sisters in Spirit and I hope to hear it say that it will renew this initiative. The research is important, but it is now time to take action and it is time for the government to act. I am hopeful the government will finally hear the calls from aboriginal peoples across the country and the international community and launch a public investigation into this matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766394">I have travelled the country, primarily in western Canada, meeting with individuals and organizations. I know this is what they are looking for and I know they are calling on the government to act, and I am as well.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1766397">That is why we are working to find answers to the complex issues surrounding the disappearance and murder of aboriginal women and girls in Canada, in particular by supporting the Sisters in Spirit initiative, run by the Native Women's Association of Canada, in collaboration with several departments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766398">Sisters in Spirit has been around for five years, and does the groundwork so that we can attack the root causes of violence against aboriginal women and girls.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766399">Putting an end to violence against women is everyone's responsibility. It is the responsibility of all levels of government, of the police and of the justice system, but also of society in general.</ParaText>

Together with federal, provincial, territorial and regional partners, Justice Canada is working hard to improve criminal justice system interventions in cases involving missing and murdered aboriginal women. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766404">Our government believes that the solution to the problem of missing and murdered aboriginal women and to the larger problem of violence against women lies in gender equality. We will keep working to end violence against all Canadian women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766405">Violence against women, aboriginal or otherwise, is unacceptable. Yes, it is up to the government to do something, but it is also up to people from all walks of life to work together to find solutions to end gratuitous violence against women. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1766411">Mr. Speaker, in preparing for, responding to and recovering from the H1N1 pandemic, Parliament's focus must be the health and welfare of all Canadians. Specifically, our goals must be to reduce the rate of hospitalizations, illness and death as well as to reduce economic and social impacts. Therefore, our discussions must remain on the winding down of the second wave as well as preparing for a possible third wave.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766412">We are here to address the question regarding the overrepresentation of aboriginal people and the morbidity and mortality statistics for the spring wave of H1N1, namely, the fact that 18% of those hospitalized due to H1N1 were aboriginal, 15% of those requiring stays in ICUs were aboriginal, and 12% of deaths were among aboriginal people, despite the fact that aboriginal people account for only 4% of the Canadian population.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766413">Before I begin a discussion of the first wave and what could have been done differently, I want to recognize the intervention of the opposition parties that resulted in Dr. Paul Gully, former director general of the Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, being appointed as a special adviser for aboriginal communities H1N1 response. I also gratefully acknowledge that aboriginal peoples have not been overrepresented in the second wave, the tremendous work of chiefs and their communities and their co-operation with health officials.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766414">Despite the improvements, an investigation still needs to be undertaken into the sad and sobering statistics. As late as the summer, one chief reported that of 30 communities in northern Manitoba, only 2 had a pandemic plan and none had been tested.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766415"> The first question must therefore be this. Why were some aboriginal communities unprepared for a possible pandemic when WHO and Canada had been preparing for several years for H5N1? Where was the support from Canadian health officials to ensure that each aboriginal community had a pandemic influenza plan that had been tested, with the necessary supplies, funding and human resources so people could receive treatment in a timely manner and have suitable infection control measures?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766416">My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128311" Type="2">St. Paul's</Affiliation> and I travelled to aboriginal communities in the summer to see first hand the state of pandemic preparedness. We heard the challenges and the lack of support from health officials. We heard comments such as, “There was no help. We figured we had to do it on our own” and “We are starting a plan. Can you order supplies?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766417">My colleague asked that the health committee be called back in August because the House had recessed on June 18 and would not sit again until September 14. We wanted to ensure preparedness should there be a second wave of pandemic influenza. Pandemic preparedness is an insurance policy. The more communities prepare for a pandemic, the greater the probability that they will be able to mitigate impacts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766418">Every effort should have been taken to protect the health of aboriginal Canadians. Did the government simply hope that a pandemic would not strike? Hope is not a strategy and is particularly untenable in aboriginal communities, where history reveals that these communities are particularly hard hit in past pandemics. Underlying environmental, health, overcrowding, poverty and water challenges today make aboriginal communities particularly vulnerable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766419">In 1918, for example, the Spanish influenza killed close to one-third of the Inuit population and forced some communities out of existence. At Okak, the disease killed 204 of 263 residents. At Hebron, it killed 86 of 100 residents. Pandemic preparedness and response should not have been a test in patience and humility for aboriginal peoples.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1766423">Budget 2009 also provides $400 million over two years to support on-reserve housing, dedicated to new social housing projects, remediation of existing social housing stock, and complementary housing activities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766424">To combat H1N1 and maintain the level of community health that all Canadians expect and deserve including aboriginal people, we have stockpiled and distributed antiviral medications to the provinces and territories, overseen production and distribution of the H1N1 vaccine, and procured additional emergency supplies to complement provincial-territorial stockpiles. We continue to conduct surveillance and lead the federal-provincial-territorial effort on providing timely public health advice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766425">Antiviral drugs and a safe and effective pandemic vaccine are key infection prevention and control measures of the Government of Canada's H1N1 response efforts to protect the health and safety of all Canadians against the flu virus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766426">We have increased antiviral drugs in the national emergency stockpile system in order to provide provinces and territories with surge capacity in the event that their stocks become overwhelmed as they treat Canadians with influenza-like symptoms during this H1N1 flu outbreak.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766427">According to the experts getting immunized with the H1N1 flu vaccine is the best way for Canadians to protect themselves and those around them from getting the H1N1 flu virus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766428">The Government of Canada continues to work with the vaccine manufacturer to supply provinces and territories with doses of the H1N1 flu vaccine on a weekly basis. As of the end of this week, approximately 24 million doses of the H1N1 flu vaccine have been distributed to provinces and territories. We are on target to immunize all Canadians who need and want the vaccine by the end of December. This of course includes first nations, Métis and Inuit populations. To date, based on numbers of doses of the vaccine we have distributed and the rate at which the provinces and territories have been administering it, at least one-third of Canadians have been immunized.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766429">We have established a national surveillance system for tracking the H1N1 virus and providing detailed analyses of its impact in Canada. This surveillance system is integrated in our longstanding FluWatch system that was established 13 years ago. The lessons learned from these analyses not only inform our response to H1N1, but also help improve our understanding of pandemics in general. This system has been expanded to include aboriginal people in the general population and is complemented by first nations on-reserve specific data collected through Health Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766430">I am able to report that as of late November, our wave two data shows that first nations living on-reserve accounted for 1.3% of hospitalizations and 1.7% of all deaths in Canada. Considering that first nations living on-reserve account for 1.4% of the population, these numbers are within the expected proportion for wave two.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766431">In terms of the off-reserve aboriginal population for the period August 30 to November 28, aboriginal people living off-reserve represented approximately 3.8% of all hospitalized cases, 6.4% of all ICU admissions and 7% of all deaths. While still slightly disproportionate compared to the general population, this is likely due to the fact that a higher percentage of aboriginal people possess the risk factors for increased health impacts due to H1N1. These factors include underlying medical conditions such as diabetes and living in remote and isolated communities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1766432">Mr. Speaker, we must also ask, why was no attempt made to slow the spread of the H1N1 virus in aboriginal communities as theoretical modelling showed was possible and has since been recommended by the WHO? Why was the science forgotten in a response that was supposed to be evidence and science-based?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766433">What was done to ensure the administration of antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu in a timely manner? Antiviral drugs can prevent serious flu complications. Dr. Anand Kumar explained to our health committee that some people had to wait seven or eight days for treatment and that this likely impacted patient outcome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766434">An investigation should ask questions regarding antiviral use, containment and social distancing measures. Other important questions include: when and where did aboriginal cases start and spread?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766435">We need to recognize there is a real health crisis across the country in aboriginal communities. Perhaps H1N1 will prompt the government to fix chronic social problems.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1766436">Mr. Speaker, the statistics cited are from wave one of the pandemic. This wave took place from April until late August.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766437"> As already stated, more recent statistics demonstrate a marked improvement in aboriginal health outcomes relating to H1N1. In all three categories, hospitalizations, ICU admissions and mortality, there is a dramatic decline. Of note, we, in wave two, were seeing fewer children and pregnant women hospitalized.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766438">I am pleased to see that the efforts we have undertaken with our aboriginal partners reflected in the steady decline of the spread and severity of H1N1 in aboriginal communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1766439">We will continue to work with our partners to monitor this pandemic and, as we learn, we will of course always improve at what we do.</ParaText>
