              <ParaText id="1499368">He said: Mr. Speaker, while the Conservative government refuses to make the changes to employment insurance that are needed to help thousands of unemployed workers, the Bloc Québécois understands that urgent action is needed, and is proposing a major overhaul of employment insurance in order to improve the system and enhance accessibility. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499369">Accordingly, I am proud to rise in this House to introduce a bill to make people who have lost their jobs as a result of a labour dispute, whether a lock-out or strike, eligible for employment insurance. This is an important bill, because it addresses a gap that currently exists in the Employment Insurance Act. Indeed, in the past, when people lost their jobs as a result of a long labour dispute, which prevented them from accumulating the required hours in the 52 preceding weeks, they were not eligible for employment insurance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499370">Now, with this bill, their benefits will be calculated based on the weeks worked before the labour dispute began, regardless of how long the dispute lasts. I therefore invite all members of this House to vote in favour of this bill.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1499383">I have now reviewed the <I>Debates </I> of May 13 and 14. On May 13, at the end of his reply to a question posed by the member for <Affiliation DbId="128300" Type="2">Laurier—Sainte-Marie</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="125159" Type="4">Minister of Public Works and Government Services</Affiliation> had stated: “To say that we are hindering Quebec is an untruth. What we are doing is giving it a boost.” (p. 3446 in the <I>Debates</I>). It is possible in a purely technical sense to argue, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister has done, that the transcript shows that these remarks are not directed to any specific individual and therefore are not out of order. A review of the video of the exchange in question has given me a better understanding of the context and suggests to me that quite a different impression may well have been left by the minister when he used the word complained of. This has led me to conclude that the minister should withdraw the word. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499384">In his comments on the point of order, the leader of the Bloc Québécois had stated: “Mr. Speaker, when I say the government is telling lies, I am not addressing the specific individual, but an institution.” (<I>Debates</I>, p. 3529). However, having reviewed the beginning of the preamble to his question on May 14, this is not entirely the case. The member for <Affiliation DbId="128300" Type="2">Laurier—Sainte-Marie</Affiliation> has made the point that this part of his preamble was of a general nature, similar to that of the <Affiliation DbId="125159" Type="4">Minister of Public Works and Government Services</Affiliation>. However, he then added that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>’s responses were also full of lies and this is where his remarks became clearly unparliamentary. And as the House is aware, I did advise the member at that time that the remark was unparliamentary and asked him to withdraw it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499385">After a full review of the remarks made on May 14, I must conclude that the member for <Affiliation DbId="128300" Type="2">Laurier—Sainte-Marie</Affiliation> did indeed use unparliamentary language in reference to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and therefore that he should withdraw the words complained of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499386">I wish now to address the second point of order, namely the one raised by the member for <Affiliation DbId="128173" Type="2">Montmorency—Charlevoix—Haute-Côte-Nord</Affiliation> on May 14.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499387">In his submission, the member pointed out that the <Affiliation DbId="128719" Type="4">Minister of State for Science and Technology</Affiliation> had used the word “dishonest” in his reply to a question posed by the member for <Affiliation DbId="128305" Type="2">Shefford</Affiliation>. The whip of the Bloc Québécois asked the Speaker to determine if such a term was acceptable to the House and, if he found it unparliamentary, to ask the minister to withdraw the word.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>

              <ParaText id="1499400"> Mr. Speaker, I move that the first report of the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration, presented on Wednesday, February 25, be concurred in. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499401">I am speaking to a motion that had been approved by the immigration committee not just at the beginning of this session, but also last session. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499402">Canada's immigration policy has a devastating impact on many Canadians and their loved ones. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499403">A situation that happens quite regularly is that thousands of Canadians fall in love with their classmates, co-workers or friends whom they meet at university, in the workplace, or at a park. After a few months or years the couple decide to get married, start a life together and sometimes have children. If the spouse that the Canadian meets happens to be a foreign student, a temporary worker, someone who has declared refugee status or has precarious immigration status in Canada, the Canadian will have to sponsor his or her spouse. That is no problem. The person can stay in Canada while the sponsorship takes place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499404">The sponsorship process in Canada can take six months, one year, two years, sometimes even three years. One would think that while the sponsorship application forms and paperwork are being processed, the wife or husband would be allowed to stay in Canada. After all, he or she has married and has possibly started a family. There may be children involved. The couple may have been together for 5 years, 10 years in some cases. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499405">Canada has a very strange policy. Canada will deport the spouse. That is hard to believe. Canada will actually deport the person with precarious status even though the person is married to a Canadian. Even though a woman could be pregnant, breastfeeding a baby or has a one-year-old child, she could be deported. Sometimes it is the mom who is deported and sometimes it is the dad. It completely breaks up the family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499406">This policy is absurd. It does not make sense. Why? Because we are cruelly separating members of a family. It causes human suffering. The breadwinner in the family could be the one who is deported. When that person stops working, the family may become destitute. If the mom who just had a baby is deported, the baby would probably be deported also, even though the baby was born in Canada. The baby and the mom would be deported back to wherever the mom came from while the husband is desperate in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499407">Once the person is deported, he or she will have to wait maybe a year or two years, sometimes a shorter period, sometimes longer, to come back to Canada. Imagine a couple who has just gotten married or has been married for a few years and has to face this kind of separation for several years. That is grossly unfair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499408">On top of that, the couple may have to pay thousands and thousands of dollars on lawyer fees and flights. For example, if the person is from China, the couple will have to pay for the flight to China for the mom and the baby and then for their return to Canada. The couple could be looking at spending $10,000 before the whole situation is finished and they get back together.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1499409">Not only is it hard for the couple, but it is hard for the Canadian public. Why? Because the case has to first be processed through the Canada Border Services Agency. Then the person is deported, which consists of court documentation. Then, the application that started in Canada has to start all over again. All of that is swept away. The applicants have to put in the application overseas and the sponsors sponsoring it here in Canada. Then the immigration department here in Canada and the embassy overseas, let us say it is in Beijing, have to start the application all over again. Think about the staffing costs, the paperwork and how much taxpayer money is wasted on this absurd policy. I am not just talking in abstraction. I will mention three situations that have hit the media. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499410">On May 21 on ctv.ca, I saw the story of a Dutch woman in Halifax who is facing deportation. She said that her ex-husband will kill her and her children if she is sent back to the Netherlands. Lillian Ralph said that Canadian officials want to deport her family next week, even though a decision on her application for permanent residency is expected soon. She is married to a Canadian. She came to Canada in 2000. She has been in Canada for nine years. She married a Canadian. She said her ex-husband has put a number on their heads. She said:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">“Literally, he has threatened to kill us many, many times... He has explained how he would do it, where he would put our bodies... he will definitely go after us.”</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499412">She is 39 years old. According to her, her ex-husband smuggled weapons. This woman said that her two young children are having nightmares about being sent back to the Netherlands.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499413">We are not just sending back one person. We are sending back three. Think of the cost. Her Canadian spouse would have to bring them back to Canada, if she survives. Apparently, her permanent residency application is supposed to be decided within 90 days. The right hand, which would be the Canada Border Services Agency, is not talking to the left hand, which would be the Canadian immigration department. The process at the immigration department is slow. It is taking 90 days. In the meantime, the Canada Border Services Agency will deport the person. That is hard to believe. It is absurd. It is a bit Kafkaesque.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499414">Another situation occurred in December 2008. In this case, I know the family really well. This occurred on December 23, just before Christmas, a time for families to celebrate. The family is Catholic. They go to a church in my riding near St. Patrick and Dundas. This young woman has been in Canada for quite a few years. She is married to a Canadian. Her spouse, Mr. Wu, is a factory worker. His wife is expecting a baby. Not only is she pregnant, but she and Mr. Wu have a 10-month-old son.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499415">Imagine telling a pregnant woman with a 10-month-old son just before Christmas that they will be deported in the new year. Imagine getting news like that. Mr. Wu, who is the factory worker, put in the application years ago to sponsor this woman. They have been married not just for a few months; they have been married for quite a while. They have a kid and are expecting a second one. Mr. Wu is very sad because his family will be broken apart. He said that if his wife could stay, it would be very good.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="30">(1030)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1499416">Chen, who is 28 and three months pregnant, is being deported by the Canada Border Services Agency. Her application to allow her to say in Canada is being processed. It is being reviewed. Even though it is being reviewed, that does not stop the deportation. She does not know how long it will take for this application to be processed, even though she was told that perhaps the application would be approved in a matter of a few months. It is absurd that she would be deported while her application may be approved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499417">They filed their application in November 2007. This was two months after they were married, before the first baby was born and before she became pregnant with the second baby. In November 2007, they were told it would be six months or a year. In November 2009, the application still had not been approved. It took two years plus several months for the approval. To sponsor a spouse within Canada, in this case, it took two and a half years. I have heard of situations which have taken even longer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499418">Imagine putting a family in this kind of heartbreaking limbo. They do not know what to do with their lives. They face deportation. After waiting for more than two years, instead of an answer, this family received a letter from the Canada Border Services Agency that ordered Chen to buy a one-way ticket, not a two-way ticket, to China. She was told she could leave her son, the 10-month old baby she was breastfeeding, in Canada if she wanted to. The baby did not have to be deported. Imagine a mother leaving the baby she is breastfeeding behind. This is completely cruel and absurd.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499419">On top of that, they have to book a non-refundable flight, and the husband is to start a spousal sponsorship process which could take two to three years. Imagine this, they have already waited for two years, they are being deported and then have to wait for two years. So this family is looking at more than four years of uncertainty. That is not the Canadian way. That is not how we should treat Canadians who happen to fall in love and marry a foreign student, worker, or someone in that kind of situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499420">At the end of the day, in this case, the <Affiliation DbId="128705" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism</Affiliation> did the right thing and allowed the family to stay. They are very appreciative. I think the minister understands that to send a pregnant mom with a 10-month old baby overseas makes no sense. I am glad that did not happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499421">It should not be a case-by-case situation. We need to change the policy. It is not as if it was determined to be a marriage of convenience. Be my guest, if the immigration department found there were marriages of convenience, deport those people. That is fine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499422">This is before the decision is made. These cases I am talking about were not determined to be marriages of convenience. What kind of marriage of convenience would we be talking about when they have two kids? We are not talking about that very small percentage that may be cheating. Deport them after it is decided they are cheating, but do not leave these Canadians in limbo.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499423">There are several things that need to be fixed. First, it should not take two or three years to have a sponsorship application approved. Second, we need to change the policy, so that while the immigration department is taking its time to make these decisions, these people are not deported.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="35">(1035)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1499424">I have one more situation. When I first started this little campaign of mine to change this policy, I came into contact with Mr. Chen. Mr. Chen came to Canada in 1995. He began a relationship with a woman who is now his wife. They worked together. After a two-year courtship, they got married. He was the main person who was working. Not only was he working, he was a very successful businessman. He managed and owned a food store, which opened in 2001, and he was a part shareholder of this company. The gross revenue was $13 million last year. This was a very successful businessman. He was married to a Canadian spouse. The spouse started the sponsorship application after they were married and two years later, he faced deportation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499425">Imagine deporting a business owner. In the last situation I talked about, it was a factory worker. This man was a businessman who owned two businesses and managed one of them. He was the head of the household, the main bread earner for his wife and child, and he faced deportation which meant that his wife and child, who are Canadians, would have no means of supporting themselves. They would probably eventually have to go on welfare while this father was deported back to his home country to await sponsorship to return to Canada. That is just absurd. There is no criminal case. They are ordinary, hard-working people. And yet, in this Canada, we have this absurd policy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499426">If we were to ask any Canadian, “Do you know that if you married, let's say, a foreign student, you would have to wait for several years to get it approved?”. They would say, “My gosh, how could that be possible?” Then, we would add, “And by the way, that person will face deportation”. They would say, “That is even hard to believe”. And if we were to say, “And then if that person is deported, it can take two or three years to return to Canada”. No one would believe that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499427">In fact, I am often stopped at Tim Hortons, and my colleagues like to tell me that I can collect all types of stories at Timmy's. Just a few weeks ago at Tim Hortons, I came across a young woman. She has a master's degree. She is working full-time. She fell in love, in the park, Christie Pits Park, with her husband to be. They got married. But he got deported. They decided not to fight it. He left to go back to, I think it was either Cuba or Mexico. I do not remember which Latin American country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499428">She has been desperately trying to bring him back to Canada because they have been together for quite a few years and have been separated now for two years. He is still waiting in Latin America to return and join his wife. He is a professional. She is a professional. She is spending a huge amount of money to hire lawyers. He is spending money to hire lawyers so that he can return to Canada. Imagine the hardship that is being created by these cruel regulations. This is a young couple. She wants to start a family with him. She travels to Latin America every three or four months to continue their relationship. She told me about the phone bills, the flights costs, and the legal costs that she is incurring because she is separated from her husband because of the deportation. </ParaText>

Yet, all too often when we are dealing with situations like spouses, like families who are being broken up, families who are being deported, the rules seem arbitrary, erratic and for the families who are caught up in this situation very Kafkaesque.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499432">I heard my colleague say, in the situation of one of the families who were going to be broken up and deported, that we had the minister intervene, but it seems that in the absence of a just, coherent system, someone has to deal with their local MP who then has to deal with the minister. At the end of the day, such a situation remains arbitrary and hence unjust. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499433">I would like to ask my hon. colleague, given the experience she has had in the immigration cases she has dealt with over the years, could she give us a sense of how we can move forward so that we do not destroy family lives, we do not penalize families who are trying to make a life as good Canadian citizens? How do we restore confidence so that the immigrant families who come to Canada, who put roots in Canada, who are the people who have helped build Canada, that they can be assured they are doing this in a country that respects them, that respects a sense of law, and respects the integrity of family which I am sure all members in the House would agree is the foundation of our society?</ParaText>

Some members may remember the case where the former minister of immigration gave a minister's permit to a former stripper and then it became a big brouhaha in the House. Then there was a new Liberal minister of immigration who decided to change the policy and allowed people to stay in Canada and apply in Canada; however, the deportation rules still continue. The immigration minister tried to fix it in a very superficial way, but did not get it done, did not get the matter resolved because deportations continued to be allowed--</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1499442">In the early 1980s, after that campaign, the spouse could in fact apply in Canada. The Liberals changed that later on.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1499459">The Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration has voted on a motion that would entitle any applicant to an automatic stay of removal and a work permit until a decision was rendered on their first in Canada spousal or common law sponsorship application.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499460">We believe our current policies strike an appropriate balance between family reunification and maintaining program integrity. The hon. member's motion is unnecessary and potentially damaging.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499461">Let me explain a bit about how our system works.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499462">Family reunification is a key element of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Keeping families together helps people integrate into Canadian society and contributes to their well-being and long-term success.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499463">As members of the House are aware, all immigration applications are carefully examined to ensure they are bona fide. For spouse or common law partner applications in Canada, processes are in place to ensure that the relationship that forms the basis of the application is genuine and the application is legitimate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499464">According to the provisions of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, spouses and common law partners of Canadian citizens and permanent residents who are already living in Canada may apply for permanent residence from within our country. In these instances, there are two types of cases: those who are in status and those who are out of status. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499465">Spouses and common law partners who are already in Canada and who are in status may apply for permanent residence in the spouse or common law partner in Canada class. In order to be eligible under this class, applicants must have a bona fide relationship, live with their sponsoring spouse or common law partner in Canada and have legal temporary status in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499466">While their applications are being processed, spouses and common law partners can apply to maintain their temporary resident status. Applicants at this point undergo an initial eligibility assessment, also known as approval in principle. Once applicants have received an approval in principle they can remain in Canada and apply for open work permits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499467">This initial eligibility assessment plays an important role in preserving the integrity of Canada's immigration program. It ensures that Citizenship and Immigration Canada has determined that an applicant's relationship is genuine before he or she is eligible to apply for a work permit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499468">These are the measures already in place for people who are in status to stay in Canada while their application is in process. However, Canada's immigration system is even more generous than that. We have measures in place for individuals who are out of status to stay here permanently as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499469">For spouses and common law partners who are in Canada without legal immigration status, a public policy was introduced in 2005 to allow these individuals, including failed refugee claimants, to apply and be processed in the in Canada class.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499470">This policy was implemented to facilitate family reunification in cases where spouses and common law partners are already living in our country with a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident but who may have certain inadmissibilities that resulted in a lack of status. These inadmissibilities include, for example, having overstayed their temporary status, working or studying without being authorized to do so, or entering Canada without a valid passport, the required visa or other documentation. Like those who are already in status, these applicants will be allowed to apply for a work permit once they have obtained approval in principle. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499471">In addition, should removal action be initiated against an applicant prior to an approval in principle decision, removals may be deferred for 60 days. This period facilitates the processing of their application to the approval in principle stage. In the majority of cases, this is more than enough time to process the application.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499472">In some cases, individuals may not be eligible for this deferral. This applies to those who are ineligible for serious reasons, such as criminality, security, and violation of human rights, those who have previously avoided removal or those who apply to the spouse or common law partner in Canada class after they have been advised that they are ready to be removed.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="55">(1055)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1499473">In addition to this initial 60 day deferral or removal, once an applicant has obtained approval in principle, a stay of removal is invoked until a final decision is made on the application.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499474">The current policy that facilitates family reunification applications and processing from within Canada is generous and flexible. In most cases, it allows people to stay in Canada while their applications are in process and once the bona fides of their application have been established it allows them to apply for an open work permit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499475">As I have outlined, the measures we already have in place make the hon. member's motion simply redundant, but it is more than that. Allowing automatic stays of removal together with automatic access to work permits to individuals applying for permanent residence through the spouse or common-law partner in Canada class could seriously undermine the integrity of Canada's immigration program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499476">Ours is an ethnically diverse and welcoming society and our immigration program is an attractive one, albeit one that is already working to its capacity. This motion would almost certainly lead to an increase in applications from individuals whose relationships might not be legitimate and who are seeking to remain in Canada through fraudulent means. Not only that, but we would also see an increase in individuals who want to delay their removal from Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499477">The government is diligent in ensuring that bona fide applications are processed in a timely fashion and maintaining Canada's commitment to family reunification. Moreover, the existing measures minimize the potential for abuse, and that is a critical point. They strike the appropriate balance between our family reunification goals and the need to maintain the integrity of our immigration system and program.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1499479">Mr. Speaker, if there is an abuse or a marriage of convenience, surely the department can make that decision and then deport the applicant. In terms of marriages of convenience, the percentage is quite low and many of them happen overseas, not within Canada. Therefore, how would continuing this policy encourage people to get married in order to remain in Canada? It sounds absurd. Marriage is very important. As some would say, if they are religious, that it is a sacred vow. How would that encourage people to take that vow just to abuse the system knowing full well that if they were found out at the end of the whole process they would get deported anyway? How would that encourage fraudulent behaviour? I do not quite understand that logic.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1499480">Mr. Speaker, I am trying to understand the member for <Affiliation DbId="128233" Type="2">Trinity—Spadina</Affiliation>'s point on this. On the one hand, she is suggesting that there are situations, even though the percentages are very low, where marriages of convenience have been determined but, on the other hand, she is asking why a couple would get married if they were not going to be committed to each other and that it was not a marriage of convenience. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499481">What she is actually arguing is that our system currently works, that it does exactly what it is supposed to do. It is supposed to entrust within the ministry the opportunity to respond and investigate these cases in a very fair and forthright manner. All of us here in the House have had these issues to deal with and, for the most part, it has been determined that marriages that fall into this category are very legitimate and are approved. However, there are situations where this simply is not the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499482">If the member for <Affiliation DbId="128233" Type="2">Trinity—Spadina</Affiliation> is suggesting that we eliminate the investigation of this and simply trust couples to move in the right direction regarding marriage, it would be anything but a marriage of convenience. That is simply not possible because that would lead to further abuse of the system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499483">We have a system currently in place that is fair, equitable and probably the best system in the world, quite frankly, which is why it is filled to capacity and overcapacity. It is such a good system to work through. Why do we want to change something that actually has a fundamental way of properly doing an investigation that, at the end of the day, finds legitimacy in almost every aspect except for a limited number of cases?</ParaText>

There are obviously times when abuse has been determined and that these marriages are considered marriages of convenience.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499488">The member makes a very important and significant addition to this discussion we are having this morning, which is that there are individuals within that bond of marriage who have been taken advantage of. They come into our constituency offices. I have had them in mine and I am sure members from all parties on both sides of the House have seen the same situations. Our system is also able to assist those individuals who were taken advantage of, who were not in a situation where the person they entered into a marriage with actually did so based on any fundamental relationship but did so simply because it gave the person the opportunity to set foot in our country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1499491">It is being determined that all marriages are illegitimate, that they are all fraudulent and that is why we should deport them first and then decide whether they are legitimate. I would say that 95% to 100% of these cases are probably legitimate. I am sorry that they were already deported.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499492">Yes, make the decision and then take action but in this case the person is considered guilty of fraudulent behaviour even before the immigration department makes a decision and the person is deported because it is presumed the person is guilty. For anyone falling in love and getting married to a person who has precarious status, it is considered that the marriage is probably illegitimate and that is why we are deporting the spouse right now without making a decision.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1499499">Mr. Speaker, I had a question for the parliamentary secretary, but I will have an opportunity to bring it up in my speech. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499500">We need to thoroughly examine what we are talking about. Therefore, for the benefit of Canadians who are tuning in, scratching their heads and asking themselves what the parliamentarians are talking about, let me give a rundown of exactly the things we are discussing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499501">We are talking about an individual who comes to Canada on a visitor visa seeking a better life. We are talking about an individual who is in Canada maybe without status or with status. This individual meets a landed immigrant and/or a Canadian citizen. Then two individuals fall in love and get married. When they get married, they have a choice of being sponsored outside Canada from their homeland or sponsored within Canada under humanitarian and compassionate grounds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499502">In some instances, for individuals visiting Canada who do not require visitor visas to come to come to Canada, it is faster to be sponsored outside Canada. However, there are instances where individuals need visitor visas to enter Canada and it is a hardship for them to leave Canada, to be sponsored outside and then to be brought back into Canada by their spouses. Right now a spousal sponsorship outside Canada can take anywhere between six to eight months and other posts can take up to three years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499503">For example, Tamils coming from Sri Lanka face processing timelines of up to three and four years, which is three and four times as much as in other posts, and I have seen this happen. People who come from Sri Lanka as visitors, fall in love with Canadians and get married have two choices. They can go back to Sri Lanka and be sponsored by their spouses, which can take up to four years, or they can be sponsored inside Canada. If they are sponsored inside Canada and they are on status, then the sponsorship is done through the case processing centre in Vegreville. Vegreville then takes a look at the paperwork and if officials believe the bona fides of the marriage, they send it to the local Citizenship and Immigration centre office in order for them to land. If they have some serious doubts such as a person might be married before, there is a child, somebody is claiming refugee status, they send it to the local Citizenship and Immigration centre. That is where the problem arises.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499504">In the local centre of Citizenship and Immigration waiting for an interview can take up to four years. Therefore, individuals sponsored by spouses, if they are in status in Canada and have a visitor visa, have to keep renewing their visitor visas for the next four years until they have an opportunity to go in front of immigration and present their cases. If for any reason they are not in status and claim refugee status, then they still have to linger in Canada for four years until their cases and interviews take place at the local Citizenship and Immigration centre.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499505">This is where the problem starts, and it is twofold. First, if individuals are in status in Canada and for whatever reason Citizenship and Immigration decides it will not give an extension on their visitor visa, they become out of status. Second, if they have come to Canada, have claimed refugee status and get married in Canada, again they are not in status. On those two occasions, we have a spouse in Canada who could be removed from Canada and it does not allow the couple to set roots, to plan for their future, to have children and to carry on a life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499506">Let me examine a particular case I dealt with recently. A young lady came to Canada from China, from the province of Fujian, and claimed refugee status. That failed. She found a Canadian and they were married. However, CBSA, the Canada Border Services Agency, which is responsible for making the decision to remove people, decided that the woman needed to be removed. The decision to removed is no longer with Citizenship and Immigration, so it can say it is not responsible.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1499507">Let us look at the family. There is a three month old child. CBSA does not care that an applicant is waiting to have an interview. It is saying that the individual has to be removed. The mother is breastfeeding the child. When the mother is to be removed from Canada and sent to China, what will happen to little Kevin, who is three months old? CBSA has said the mother can take him with her. How in God's name can we send little Kevin, who is a Canadian citizen, to China? He has to get a visitor visa into China. If the mother is to be sponsored by the husband to come back, it could take a year and a half to two years. We will have a Canadian child in China, probably out of status over six or seven months, and we have separated the couple. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499508">This is what is being faced in reality. We have Canadians who are marrying folks who are in Canada. Maybe their status runs out or maybe they claim refugee status. They are trying to start a family or they have a family. Then they go in front of CBSA. In this case, the CBSA officer bluntly told the couple to get a passport for little Kevin in order for them to remove the mother and for Kevin to go with her to China. The rights of this three-month-old Canadian are tossed out the window by a CBSA officer, who pretty well has absolutely no heart or feelings. He does not give a hoot about a three month old.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499509">That is what we are facing with these existing difficulties. These are the people we are talking about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499510"> There is another case I would like to discuss. A young individual came to Canada and claimed refugee status. He found a wife and they got married. She was three months pregnant when CBSA told him he had to go. He would either be removed or he could remove himself voluntarily, so he removed himself voluntarily. That was two years ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499511">He is on his way back in the next few days. However, in the meantime, the child had his first birthday and the father was not here. He was not here to enjoy his son's first words. The father was not here to enjoy being called “papa”. The father was not here to be present at the birth of his child. We went to Citizenship and Immigration and explained the situation. We asked if it could expedite the case, but we were told no. It does not care. This was after he voluntarily removed himself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499512">We are talking about a young individual who found a wife. He got married. She was pregnant with a child. Why was he removed? Why was the family separated? The department should have done exactly what this motion calls for. If it is the first time individuals are sponsoring their spouses, they do not get removed until they have had their interviews at CIC, the local Citizenship and Immigration centre, and they are given work permits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499513">In the case of the individual who was sent back to China when his wife was pregnant, that would have fit perfectly. He would have stayed in Canada. He would have been given a work permit. He would have had an interview. There is no doubt that it was a bona fide marriage. There was a child involved. How can we tell a people that they were married out of convenience when there are children involved? Certainly, convenience does not include that sort of arrangement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499514">In the case of this individual, remaining in Canada and establishing himself probably would have been less of a hardship for the wife. The child would have had his father with him. They probably would have bought a home and moved on. He probably would have continued at his business and the couple would have been successful. What did we do instead? We separated the family. His business went down the drain. Now, he coming back to Canada. He is going to see the child, who is now over a year old. He has his first birthday a couple of months ago. He has only ever seen his child in pictures. He has to realize that the only reason he is coming back to Canada is because of his child.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1499515">The onus is on us. The severity of the cases we are talking about, when we separate husbands and wives and they are apart for a couple of years after they are married because we have told them they have to go back, or when we go into places of work and remove the husband or the wife, who have a baby, or when we order a couple to get a passport for the child, a Canadian citizen, because we are about to deport the mother, I challenge anyone in the House to tell me our system works. The needed changes are well overdue. These changes must come in so we protect young Canadian families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499516">I hear the Conservative minister and the parliamentary secretary say that there are a number of bogus marriages. Yes, we will run across that, but at the end of the day, that will certainly take care of itself when they have their interviews, when the individuals go before an officer of immigration and try to dot their <I>i</I>s and cross their <I>t</I>s that their marriages are bona fide, but they are not, then they will be removed. However, we need to address those overwhelming cases that we see day after day in the newspaper, where we have families being kicked out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499517">Let us look at what happens when a case is referred from a case processing centre in Vegreville to the local office. The local office will tell the individual not to send any representations and not to bother the office for the next 36 to 48 months. The couple is therefore at a standstill. The husband, if he is being sponsored by a Canadian wife, has absolutely no health care or work permit. It is the same with the wife if she is being sponsored by her husband. Not having any health care, if the couple decides to have a child in Canada, a little Canadian, the father has to cover the health cost of delivering the baby. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499518">A delivery in Ontario, such as a delivery in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="128362" Type="2">Scarborough—Agincourt</Affiliation> in Toronto, can cost up to $15,000. A married couple submits its paperwork and then the husband and wife are told they cannot do anything, that have to wait for four years. When the immigration officer is told that the wife is pregnant, how can it be questioned whether it is a bona fide marriage? The immigration officer will say it will not be called anything and they couple will have to wait until the case is dealt with in four years. If the husband and wife want to have children, that is up to them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499519">I have five daughters and I know the cost of bringing up children. However, imagine the cost of also having to pay for the delivery of the children? Some of us share the fact that we have children one after the other for a number of years. If individuals wait for four years and have two or three children, it will cost $45,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499520">I worked on a case in my riding where the mother had two children and was sponsored by the husband. The case was being at the Scarborough Citizenship and Immigration office. The mother was pregnant again and the couple did not want to move. It got a little more hairy when there was a knock at the door. It was CBSA with a removal order. There are two Canadians involved. The mother is pregnant again and CBSA is there to remove her. Where is the reality? Where is the common sense?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499521">We hear the parliamentary secretary say that it works, that we have checks and balances in place and the system works. That is totally false. The system does not work. There is case after case in our offices where there are bona fide marriages with children involved, and where CBSA and CIC take their sweet time. With CIC, if it goes to the local office, it is four years. It does not care if there are children, or if there are circumstances or if the husband has to go to work because the Canadian wife who sponsored him has already one or two children and has to stay at home to take care of them while the husband provides.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1499522">There is a husband who is being sponsored staying at home and cannot go to work. How would members of the House feel if they could not provide for their family? How would they feel if they had one or two children, their wife had just come out of the hospital and there was absolutely no income coming into the house? That is the tragedy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499523">This is why we are saying we should allow them to have a work permit. This is why we are saying that we should also move forward quickly to make sure that the female spouse has the opportunity to deliver children in Canada and the bearing of children is not a burden on a Canadian family. These are Canadians who have been born in Canada. These are Canadians and the CBSA officer is saying to the mother, “Get a passport for the child because you are going to be deported and we are going to send the Canadian child with you to China”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499524">Who are we deporting? Are we deporting the mother or are we sending into exile a young Canadian? Who are we hindering and who are we kiboshing? I will tell the House who we are doing it to. We are doing it to a child who is four or five months old, little Kevin. Once his mother goes, Kevin will have to follow his mother to China.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499525">When Kevin goes to China or another country, he will be there as a visitor. If Kevin is sick and needs to go to the doctor, the local medical facilities will not take care of Kevin because he is not from that country. We are putting in harm's way a Canadian citizen who should have health care and all the other benefits. We are kicking him out of the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499526">Imagine if little Kevin follows his mother, lives in China and becomes severely sick and he has been out of Canada for six months. The father then goes to China to bring the child back. OHIP in Ontario would say, “I am sorry, but the child has been out of the country for more than three months or six months. Therefore, the child is not entitled to health care”. How can we face a family when we separate them? How do we go about telling them that we stuck it to them?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499527">We did not care about little Kevin. We did not care about the young man whom we separated from his wife and she had a child in Canada who is a year and a half old. Frankly, we just do not care. Why? Because maybe they are new immigrants. Why? Because maybe they do not fit the mould of the rest of us. Why? Because maybe we are xenophobic. I do not like to think that is the case. I hope it is not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499528"> In order to make sure that we have a society that looks after families and we have a society that cares about the young ones and the young families, it is about time we stepped up to the plate and helped these young Canadians who found somebody they want to marry. Maybe the person is not in Canada, or maybe the person does not have status, or maybe the person has run out of status, but we have to take the responsibility in order to help them establish a family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499529">This is why it is very important to note that it mentions first time applicants only. I urge all my colleagues in the House to support this very important motion as we try to establish and build families and help young families grow with the rights and obligations that we have as Canadians and as the government. </ParaText>

He has had a great deal of immigration work in his constituency because he has a large immigrant new Canadian community in his riding as I do in mine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499531">Like the member for <Affiliation DbId="128233" Type="2">Trinity—Spadina</Affiliation>, I was a constituency assistant for many years and had to deal with many situations where families faced complications in their immigration status. The most difficult ones were where a family was being separated because of some immigration problem or there was the threat of that. For many years I was able to say that family reunification, keeping families together, was a key principle of Canada's immigration policy. That was the overriding concern of what our immigration policy was about. Yet we have this phenomenon, this particular aspect of the way immigration law is enforced that actually forces spouses of Canadians out of the country because of some problem with their immigration status.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499532">Could the member comment on the importance of ensuring that keeping families together remains the key principle of our overall immigration policy?</ParaText>

It is the only principle that obliges us. It is the obligation of every one of us in this House. Whether we are members in government, in opposition or the third or fourth party, it is our obligation to make sure that we support, nurture and are shoulder to shoulder during the good times, the hard times and the times when young families are trying to stay together. It is probably the toughest decision that has to be made by a family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499534">I want to go back to the family that I was talking about. The decision was whether the mother would take little Kevin with her or leave him behind. There is absolutely nothing tougher for a mother to have to decide. There would be nothing easier than for a CBSA officer to say, “We will wait and we will not deport you until your case has been heard by citizenship and immigration”. There is nothing easier than the minister making sure we adopt this motion so that the separation of families does not continue.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1499535">Mr. Speaker, in his speech the member stressed the fact that the report from the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration talks about filing a first in Canada spousal or common law sponsorship application. This should go some way to addressing some of the concerns that somehow adopting this policy of preventing the deportation of a spouse would clog up the works in the immigration process and give people the opportunity to do end runs around appropriate processing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499536">We are talking about the first application. We are not talking about a second or third application, or other ways of prolonging someone's stay in Canada when there have been decisions made about the person's status or the bona fides of a marriage, for instance.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1499538">Mr. Speaker, certainly the report addresses the first application. There are people who make a habit of getting involved in marriages that are not bona fide, doing end runs and putting their names out as a spouse a number of times. Those people are a very thin minority. I have spoken to some of them and said that they should not do it and it is going to hurt the rest of the people. That is why this report refers to the first application in a marriage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499539">If an applicant is, let us say, wife shopping or husband shopping and there are first, second and third marriages, then we know clearly that the individual is not part of a legitimate marriage, does not want to establish himself or herself in Canada and does not want to start a family. This is why it is very important that when we vote on this, members on all sides of the House, especially the government side, understand that this is about the first application and that they do not participate in separating families and putting young Canadian children in harm's way in countries where the medical system virtually does not exist.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1499542">There used to be an expression used in my workplace. When I worked at Bell Canada changes were forever being made.

              <ParaText id="1499544">Mr. Speaker, this is not as they would say at Bell, if someone digs a hole, somebody else will find an opportunity to fill it. This is a situation where two people meet, one of whom might be in status, but the couple falls in love and wants to start a family. There is no hole here. There is no magic. It is two young people, or two older people for that matter, who want to be together near the end of their lives and live happily together. There is no hole. There is no magic. It is just two people who, if they are younger, want to start a family or, if they are older, want to find comfort and security with each other. It is just a family. It is the obligation of every member in this House to protect, to nurture and to support those families. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499545">If somebody wants to talk about people who are trying to make end runs on a system and find ways of filling the holes, there is nothing like that in this situation. This is about a first application. The person is given the opportunity to have his or her day with a citizenship and immigration officer. If that officer decides that a person is not bona fide in Canada, then the officer proceeds to remove that person. Until that time, people should not be removed from Canada. People should be given the opportunity to establish themselves, to start a family and to work to support that family. There is nothing more important than for a spouse, a husband, to be able to work and provide for his wife and children. There is nothing more important than for a mother to know that she will not be separated from her three-month-old child and that the three-month-old child will not be forced to go to a country where the child is not going to be treated as a citizen of that country because in fact the child is not a citizen of that country. That child is a Canadian and we are putting the child in harm's way. </ParaText>

This motion is a response to a real situation. It reflects the situation of citizens and permanent residents who come to our offices.

              <ParaText id="1499553">We have also heard from members of the government, including the parliamentary secretary, who have shown insensitivity toward the reality of immigrant families. Given the speeches we have heard this morning, I also believe that the government is insensitive toward the shortage of workers in this country. The people who fall into this category are often skilled workers. They also include people with unstable jobs and young families. Earlier, my colleague talked about children born to people who are in Canada temporarily. We have to remember whom we are talking about. There is also the whole tendency to support economic immigration. While it is no less important, the issue of family reunification is part of immigration policy and is the very cornerstone of that policy. We need to keep this in mind, because family reunification is a question of values, a question of our society and how we want to live together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499554">As I mentioned earlier, we need to consider the situation of young families and the impact of unjustified separation. This is not the first time this issue has been debated in Parliament. The Bloc Québécois supports the motion before us that the report of the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration on family reunification be concurred in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499555">The Bloc Québécois believes that it is important to put a high value on the family. On February 12, we voted in favour of the committee's motion. I would also like to remind this House that the government members opposed the motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499556">We know that the immigration process is long. It can take several months from the time an application for permanent residence is filed until a final decision is rendered. It makes sense to us to try to keep the couple and the family together during this process.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1499557">When things are not done this way and when the policy as currently written is maintained and upheld, thousands of families end up vulnerable and distressed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499558">The government has the moral duty to ensure that such families are treated with the greatest possible compassion. I think that all opposition members have stressed that now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499559">The motion strikes me as wholly reasonable. On the one hand, it does not apply to anyone who has committed a serious crime, that is, those who are inadmissible because of their involvement in organized crime. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499560">On the other hand, there is a time limit. The spouse can have a temporary work permit and an automatic stay of removal. However, if the person's application were to be rejected, these advantages would be nullified and these privileges lost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499561">In the absence of regulations, I feel we need to ask the Canada Border Services Agency to revise its policy with respect to these cases in order to ensure that it properly respects the rules of equity and natural justice and allows these people to benefit from the immigration policy as it stands.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499562">As I have just said, we also need to keep in mind the arbitrariness of an immigration policy that contradicts the objective of family reunification. Despite what the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and his departmental officials said in committee when the Immigration Act was being reviewed, there is no efficient process at this time for examining all of the circumstances of a file before someone is removed from the country. Nor is there any hearing process which would allow people to defend themselves and raise questions of law. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499563">Permanent residents, Canadian citizens, are therefore deprived of the possibility of claiming their rights and drawing attention to one important element in the legislation, which is family reunification and the importance of the family to our values.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499564">I would also encourage hon. members to keep in mind the shortage of Immigration and Refugee Board members. The shortage of IRB members has a serious negative impact on case processing times. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499565">When the Conservatives came to power, there were five IRB vacancies. Their management of IRB appointments has been nothing short of disastrous. The government has deliberately slowed the process for appointing and reappointing board members. As a result, immigration claims processing was plagued with undue delays. During most of the Conservatives' mandate, the average vacancy rate for commissioners has been 36%. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499566">In 2008, things were so bad that the IRB chair warned the Conservative government about its inaction and lack of initiative in appointing new board members. He emphasized the impact of the crisis. He told us all about the IRB's current crisis situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499567">The situation is disastrous, and the chair of the IRB had to publicly chastise the <Affiliation DbId="128705" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism</Affiliation> for failing to carry out his duty to appoint commissioners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499568">As the official IRB report states, “The growing deficit of decision-makers has a direct impact on the IRB's ability to render fast and fair decisions”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499569">A number of organizations working with immigrants and refugees have testified about the impact on the immigration system of the lack of IRB members to hold hearings and render decisions. Since the ongoing shortage began, it has been impossible to find out when immigration claims involving family reunification cases were scheduled for hearing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499570">This motion addresses issues related to family reunification and, as such, we must remind the minister and those in charge at Citizenship and Immigration Canada of the pressing need to review our immigration policy and honour the role and importance of family values. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="45">(1145)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1499571">As I mentioned earlier, this is the cornerstone of the Canadian policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499572">What we find unfortunate today is that the primary purpose of the immigration policy has changed. Canada's current immigration policy has led to a decrease in the family component of the immigrant pool over the past decade. Immigration by family members used to account in general for 60% of the annual flow. Now it is less than 20%. The policy favours economic immigrants more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499573">The changes made to the regulations before the Immigration Act was implemented eliminated the assisted relative class. I believe that some members mentioned this earlier. In addition, the Immigration Act changed family class applications, restricting discretionary authority during the selection process and bringing in unfair exclusion policies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499574">I would remind the House that under the law, families' right to immigrate and remain in Canada is subject to many exceptions and restrictions. Immigrating is therefore not as easy as all that, and it takes a long time to process immigration applications.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499575">As a general rule, permanent residents and citizens can sponsor spouses, common-law and conjugal partners and their children. There are rare exceptions, as I mentioned earlier, where spouses are inadmissible. But I find the current situation completely unacceptable, and it is condemned in the motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499576">We would be in favour of amending the immigration policy so that spouses who are already here can be given a work permit and allowed to stay in Canada with their family while their application is being processed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499577">I would also like to talk about issues such as the disparity in application processing times among visa offices. Citizenship and Immigration Canada has made a public commitment to adopt a service standard of six months for processing sponsorship applications for spouses, common law and conjugal partners and dependent children. Several announcements have been made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499578">My colleague said earlier that 80% of cases were finalized in three months in New Delhi. My figures may be somewhat out of date, but the Citizenship and Immigration Canada website gives time frames for processing family reunification applications. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499579">I would also like to add that it is obvious from this website that there is a longer waiting period in certain countries. There is therefore a disparity in the way applications are processed and it seems not to bear any relation to the program's integrity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499580">I would therefore invite the minister to debate this and the committee to examine more specifically the disparities between one office and another in processing times. This will likely turn up cases that are purely political and that have influenced decision makers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499581">I also believe that sponsorship applications should be finalized, and at the very least there should be a commitment once the person is here that his or her application will be finalized within a reasonable length of time. That could be one year, since medical exams are usually valid for a year. That would spare sponsored persons the expense of a second medical.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499582">I am also of the opinion that Citizenship and Immigration Canada is not coming clean about the processing times for sponsorship applications. Their website gives the impression that they are handled within a predictable length of time, regardless of where they come from, and that is not the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499583">In the meantime, Canadian citizens and permanent residents continue to pay substantial application fees with the false hope that their files will be processed within a predictable period of time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499584">The sponsorship situation is linked to policy decisions. It is a matter of values. The government can decide that, by virtue of Canadian values, admission to Canada is not justified under current policies. Such a decision has major consequences.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1499585">We feel that the opposition members have taken a stand on what is important for them and have centred their actions on the values of family reunification. We cannot say the same for the government members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499586">One assumes this is a political decision. Family is a fundamental issue and as such deserves public debate. That is why we are debating this matter today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499587">If the government intends to assign a low priority to family reunification, it ought to come out and say so openly, so that future immigrants can make informed decisions about coming to Canada. The lengthy processing times outside Canada should be included in the factors for assessing sponsorship applications within Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499588">I will make that my conclusion. I have raised several important points and I have contributed certain points that are connected to our experiences as members of Parliament with respect to this important issue which touches our hearts and engenders compassion. Immigrants are important and we must enact open policies. </ParaText>

The minister talked about the principles governing immigration in Canada. </ParaText>

This mantra was repeated all the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499593">When the first Conservative minister came to committee he left out family reunification. When I asked him about it afterward he said he was trying to keep his remarks short.

I was also surprised that he did not speak about family reunification at the committee. Family reunification is the cornerstone of Canadian immigration policy. It is one of the objectives of the act. We cannot ignore the act. In a number of situations, which we are well aware of, the government has decided to not implement sections of the act.

              <ParaText id="1499600">Mr. Speaker, that is a very good question. I would remind the House that the immigration policy has changed and as a result of the amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the burden of proof often lies with the claimant. The system is designed in such a way that it is easy to refuse someone. As I was explaining earlier, when someone is refused, the decision is somewhat arbitrary and they are not always entitled to appeal; they do not always have the right to be heard. Some situations I have had to deal with in my riding fall into this category, and the only available means is to invoke section 25 of the act, that is, appeal to the discretion of the minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499601">As for removals, I have seen many situations in which the people were removed not because their file was incomplete, but because of administrative technicalities. For example, when they were defended in court by the lawyer assigned to them, that individual did not do his or her job properly. Unfortunately, the claimants suffered the consequences of that and had no means of recourse. Furthermore, in many situations, the fact that wait times are long—and the government refuses to honestly and openly address questions related to why it takes so long to reach decisions in these cases—causes hardship. When it comes to refusals and removals, much greater sensitivity is needed in that regard.</ParaText>

Then the couple could get on with their lives, start a new family and perhaps have children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499603">Right now, instead of processing an application in six months, we have seen situations where it takes over a year, two years or sometimes even three years.

The government is not meeting this commitment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499606">In 2003, the immigration minister announced improvements in the form of a new kit for spouses that made it possible to consider the results of medical exams with the sponsorship application. A number of announcements have been made as well since the Conservatives took office. Yet the statistics show that two of the busiest offices, where we know false documents have been submitted and information is unreliable, are able to process spousal applications within three to four months. This is an example of the disparity among the immigration offices, and it concerns me. Most offices that issue visas do not seem to be meeting the six-month standard.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1499608">The motion we are debating today has two parts: allowing applicants who have filed their first in Canada spousal or common-law sponsorship application temporary work permits and entitling them to an automatic stay of removal until a decision is rendered on their applications. I do not support the motion. It is unnecessary and potentially harmful to our immigration system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499609">With regard to the first point, work permits are already issued to those who have been determined to be in a bona fide relationship. Regarding the second part of the motion, we already provide a 60-day deferral of removal for many applicants who do not have status in Canada if removal action is initiated. This is an adequate amount of time in the majority of cases to determine whether the application will be accepted. In addition, a regulatory stay of removal is granted automatically once the applicant has been determined to be in a bona fide relationship meeting eligibility requirements. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499610">What I would like to discuss are the dangers inherent in adopting the motion. While the government is fully committed to family reunification, it is imperative that we guard the integrity of Canada's immigration program. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499611">Allowing automatic stays of removal and automatic access to work permits will lead to an increase in applications from people wanting to remain in Canada by any means, legal or otherwise. Our immigration system is already generous and fair. The proposed automatic stay and automatic open work permits are two significant elements that will make it even more attractive to those who want to circumvent the process. An already busy system may overload, leading to delays and a greater possibility of abuse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499612">There is presently a rigorous process in place to verify the legitimacy of each application. Under this process, each claim is examined carefully to ensure that relationships are bona fide. When immigrants apply to remain in Canada as part of the spouse or common-law partner in Canada class, immigration officials may check an applicant's background, may perform in-person interviews and examine other evidence in order to assess the relationship. Applicants who are assessed to be living in Canada in a legitimate relationship with an approved sponsor receive a first stage approval, or approval in principle, pending the outcome of medical, criminal and security checks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499613">Once this approval in principle is granted, applicants can then apply for open work permits and those with removal orders receive a regulatory stay of removal until a final decision is made on their application. However, I have already stated that our present system is generous and fair. It is also flexible. For spouses and common-law partners who are in Canada but do not have legal immigration status, there is a policy in place that allows these individuals to apply and be processed in the in Canada class.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499614">The generous provisions of our immigration program make it a very attractive one and therefore, I might add, extremely busy. Immigration officers are trained to be vigilant in watching for inconsistencies that may indicate a relationship is not bona fide, thus ensuring that only genuine applicants are granted approval in principle. However, even with the due diligence exercised by Citizenship and Immigration officials, so-called relationships of convenience are already a concern. There is a very real possibility that instances of fraudulent claims such as these will increase if this motion is adopted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499615">The policy that is currently in place facilitates the reunification of families and guards against abuse. It protects the integrity of our current immigration program. The hon. member's motion, on the other hand, calls for actions that are not only unnecessary, but would open the system to fraud and misuse. I urge my colleagues in the House to vote against this motion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1499619">Therefore, my question for the hon. member is this. Should the son of someone in his family find a wife and get married, and that individual is in limbo for four years, and if she were to become pregnant, would the son be eligible, available and willing, even afford, to pay the $15,000 that it takes for the delivery?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1499620">Mr. Speaker, one of the important things that we have to consider here is that when it comes to family reunification, we have to recognize that our government has been supportive of measures that increase the possibility that if there are marriages of convenience, they are dealt with and dealt with properly. Really, what we are talking about right now is the increase in immigration fraud and concerns that we have in that regard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499621">We do look at these overseas spouses and partners and try to make sure that they are processed on a priority basis. The example of which he speaks, of four years, I believe is a bit of a stretch. Specifically, there are measures under existing provisions that allow applicants to remain in Canada. Spouses and partners can seek and maintain their temporary residence status while their applications for permanent residence are being processed.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1499624">If I am understanding the Conservative government's logic, it is saying that any application to sponsor a spouse who is in Canada is going to be fraudulent anyway and that is why it is going to deport the spouse while it makes a decision on whether it is a genuine application or not.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1499630">Mr. Speaker, perhaps the member was not here when I spoke at around 10:30 a.m. this morning. I actually named cases, applications that had gone in on November 27, 2007. In the case of Mr. Wu, he sponsored his wife, Chen. That case has taken two years and there is still no decision. It will probably be another six or nine months before one is made. That is close to three years for a Canadian to sponsor his spouse. In this situation there was a child involved and a second one on the way. The wife is pregnant. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499631">Can the member tell me why the immigration department would take so long in making a decision, two or three years, and how can he justify deporting the pregnant wife and the 10-month-old child during this lengthy period?

              <ParaText id="1499637">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in the debate today to this concurrence motion in the first report of the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration. I want to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="128233" Type="2">Trinity—Spadina</Affiliation> for giving us this opportunity to talk about this important issue today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499638">The key part of the committee's report is a recommendation that the government allow any applicant, unless he or she has serious criminality, who has filed his or her first in Canada spousal or common-law sponsorship application, accompanied by a permanent residency application, to be entitled to a temporary work permit and an automatic stay of removal until a decision is rendered on his or her application. It is a very straightforward recommendation that tries to address a very difficult situation that all too often arises in dealing with immigration policy here in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499639">I want to go over some of the key parts of this. The committee clearly understood that criminality was an issue that had to be taken into consideration in these circumstances, which is something we want to take very seriously. The committee said that serious criminality still must be considered in these circumstances and that there was often a reason to proceed to deportation and removal when there was an issue of criminality. The committee has been careful. It has not said that we excuse criminality if we are going to change and make this policy clear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499640">The committee also made it clear that this deals with first in Canada spousal or common-law sponsorship applications. Therefore, we are not talking about attempts to drag out the process or delay the imminent decision on a file by successive applications and appeals. We are talking about the first application for a spousal or common-law sponsorship application. This is not down the chain somewhere. This is at the very beginning of that process. The committee was very wise to include that and has been very careful to include that language in its recommendation in the report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499641">The committee report also talks about an in Canada spousal or common-law sponsorship application accompanied by a permanent residency application. In effect, we are getting the whole thing at once. We are not doing a separate spousal application and a later application for permanent residency. It was very prudent of the committee to ensure that it was saying that everything had to be in order about the application, that it had to be a serious application and that all aspects of the application needed to be complete and part of what was being considered by the department. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499642">It was very wise of the committee to do that because we want to ensure the system has integrity and we want to ensure that people engaging this new policy are very serious about that engagement and very serious about their situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499643">The committee was also wise to talk about entitlement to a temporary work permit until the decision has been reached on the application. I think everyone in the country knows the importance of work and how many families have struggled with the requirement that both spouses work to maintain a reasonable standard of living in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499644"> I think that was a very wise inclusion. We know the financial stress that many families who are going through the immigration process are under and especially those who have gone through a difficult immigration process often face that. It was very wise of the committee to include the entitlement to a temporary work permit until a decision is rendered on the application.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499645">The automatic stay of removal is also very important. We know that removal is a serious issue that involves the need for legal representation and a new level of engagement with the law in Canada. To get to that point, it is always very difficult to stop that process once it has begun. The seriousness of deportation has ongoing ramifications. It will ultimately take the direct intervention of the minister, I believe, to allow someone to return to Canada after the person has been removed and deported. It is a serious level of engagement of our immigration laws to consider removal and deportation. The committee was wise to say that should not be needed until a decision is made on the application. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1499646">This is a very prudent recommendation, a conservative recommendation in the small “c” sense. The fact that it gained a majority support at the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration is an indication of how carefully crafted it was to deal with very serious situations. Some of the most difficult situations that any member of Parliament can face is dealing with a family that is about to be separated because of some aspect of our immigration law. The committee was wise to be very careful in how it crafted this recommendation. I would hope the government would take it more seriously than it seems to be doing this morning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499647">What we also must remember, when we look at this situation, is that we are talking about but a Canadian sponsoring his or her spouse or partner. We are not talking about people who are trying to come into Canada who have no connection to Canada. We are talking about someone who is related to a Canadian in the most direct way as his or her spouse or partner. It is important to keep in mind that we are talking about Canadians who want their spouse to be with them here in Canada and that is a crucial piece of this recommendation from the committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499648">Overall, it is a very prudent, important and carefully constructed recommendation from the standing committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499649">I want to pay tribute to my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128233" Type="2">Trinity—Spadina</Affiliation>. Like me, she was a constituency assistant to a member of Parliament for many years. She has had, like I, the experience of sitting with constituents who find themselves in these kinds of difficulties and has sat with them as they faced the possibility of their family being split and a family member, a spouse, being removed from Canada. I am sure members can imagine that there is not a more difficult situation than to sit with people and try to advocate for them when they find themselves in that circumstance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499650">My constituency staff and my case workers, Ayesha Haider, Caren Yu and Jane Ireland, have had the same experience in recent months of having to sit with constituents who are on the verge of their family being split up and have sat with them through that experience of seeing a spouse removed from Canada. It is one of the most difficult situations that they can deal with. I want to thank them for taking that responsibility and working with those folks to try to find every avenue that would make it possible for that family to stay together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499651">I believe families need to be the key principle behind our immigration laws and policy. Family reunification must be a fundamental principle of Canada's immigration law and for many years it was always seen as the key aspect. Keeping families together and reuniting families here in Canada was crucial to a successful immigration policy. I think it is one of the reasons why Canada, around the world, is seen as having a very successful immigration policy. If we were to look at the history of immigrants to Canada, the ones who have been most successful have been those who have had family here in Canada and have been reunited with them because it gives them a built-in support committee or a built-in settlement committee that allows them to adapt more quickly and more happily to life in Canada. We are loath to forget that family reunification has been the most successful part of our immigration program, which is good cause for continuing a bias in favour of families when it comes to our immigration policies, For me, that is a no-brainer. When we look at the immigration program, we will see that success. Most of us know from our own families that family reunification was an important aspect of immigration for many of our families. Successful immigrants come out of family reunification and we need to maintain that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499652">We heard concerns this morning that the Conservatives may be moving away from that emphasis in our immigration policy.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1499653"> Mr. Speaker, you and I were on the immigration committee in the last Parliament when the then minister of citizenship and immigration, Mr. Monte Solberg, made his first visit to that committee and made his presentation entitled, “Minister's Vision for Citizenship and Immigration”. I remember being quite shocked listening to the minister's statement to the committee when he talked about the principles behind Canada's immigration program, the needs of the Canadian economy, the protection of vulnerable people and the refugee program. He did not talk about family reunification. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499654">For years, Canada has had sort of a mantra. When we talk about the goals and principles of the immigration program, we talk about family reunification, the needs of the Canadian economy, the protection of vulnerable people and nation building.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499655">The former minister, Mr. Solberg, however, left out nation building and family reunification. I thought those were very serious omissions. When it came to my time to question the minister, I said that he had listed the important principles behind immigration but that for the first time, I suspect, in many years, a minister has left out family reunification and I asked him why he did that. The minister replied that he was trying to keep his remarks short so he had not included everything but that he did see it as important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499656">I think the first time the immigration minister in a new government visits the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration his statement is very carefully drawn out. It is not something that is done carelessly. The words are chosen very carefully.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499657">As it turns out, that was our first indication that for the Conservative government family reunification had literally dropped off the list of key principles around immigration. We have seen that with the emphasis on temporary foreign workers. We have seen that with the emphasizing of economic immigration over family reunification that has come with the Conservative government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499658">That is a very sad situation because family reunification and family immigration has been the strongest part of our immigration program and it is what has built this nation. To turn our backs on that success story is a serious problem indeed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499659">When I hear a Conservative standing today to criticize this recommendation from the standing committee, I worry that this is another example of the Conservatives failing to support families in Canada and failing to support Canadians as they build their families. I want to ensure we have a clear debate and that the government is forced to take a very clear position on this because it is something that I think is very important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499660">In my own constituency in recent months we have had a number of serious cases where families have suffered through this kind of situation where a spouse has been removed from Canada. I must say that these are very traumatic situations. One of them involved a spouse who was here in Canada on a visitor's visa. She had overextended her visitor's visa, forgot to renew it and, unfortunately, that left her out of status. She and her spouse realized the mistake but it did not change the fact that she was married to a Canadian and that she was pregnant with their first child. Unfortunately, we could not convince the government to cut them any slack to ensure this family would not be separated, especially at such a crucial time in their life when they were expecting the arrival of their first child.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499661">The woman was placed on an airplane at the Vancouver airport. It was very difficult and traumatic getting her to that point of being on the plane. On the plane, she took ill before it took off. The flight had to be delayed and she had to be taken to the hospital where I believe she remained for about a week just because of the stress of what was happening to her at that point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499662">I think we can all agree that this is not a good situation for a pregnant woman. Needless to say, she and her husband were most distraught with what was going on. The husband was often denied visits with her during her hospitalization. Later, when she recovered from that immediate episode, she was removed from Canada. Here we have a family separated from their means of support, a father separated from the imminent birth of his child and a family separated by thousands and thousands of miles.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1499663">The father had to take an unpaid leave of absence from his job to be with his wife when their child was born. Having to take that time inflicted significant financial difficulties on the family. It affected his ability to maintain his position where he worked as well. This was all totally unnecessary. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499664">This was a bona fide relationship. The spouse was pregnant. Yet, somehow we could not find it in our immigration process or in our hearts as Canadians to make sure this family stayed united in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499665">We felt very strongly that the government failed this family at an important time for them. It will take some time to rebuild their confidence in this country. All of us who had anything to do with this particular case were very shaken because we could not get any minister to intervene directly in this case. This is one example of an issue that my constituency staff and constituents has experienced recently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499666">There are other complicated ones, and I do not deny that there are complications in all of these situations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499667">Recently, another constituent of mine was deported. He came here as a 10 year old. He did not know that his family had not made the appropriate arrangements to have him granted status in Canada. He had a wife and a child in Canada. He also had a criminality issue, but that was taken care of. He did his time in Canada, and he was released. As a result of that criminal conviction it came to light that he did not have status in Canada, and the government moved to remove him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499668">I take criminal issues very seriously, but this individual had been in Canada for over 20 years, I believe. He did his time, so I think that was resolved. But at that point he was our criminal, because he was a Canadian, by all intents and purposes, if not by direct legal definition, who had been raised in this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499669">To say that he should have to leave this country and not be able to support his family and not see his child grow is a serious issue. Again, we failed another Canadian family by not having a more generous and clear policy around this kind of situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499670">I would also be remiss if I did not mention the situation of the Lennikov family in Burnaby. They live in the riding of my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128505" Type="2">Burnaby—New Westminster</Affiliation>. This family is about to be separated, within the coming week, I believe. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499671">Mikhail Lennikov, his wife Irina, and Dmitri, his son, came to Canada 11 years ago. They made refugee claims and they were found to be refugees, although Mr. Lennikov's claim was complicated by the fact that he had worked for the KGB in Russia. He was forced to work for the KGB. He quit the KGB after five years, and then he came to Canada. He did not hide that information when he made his refugee claim. We were not able to accept that someone could be forced to do that kind of work, turn their back on that work and be a legitimate refugee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499672"> Dmitri Lennikov, the son, is graduating from high school this week. Mr. Lennikov has been granted a temporary stay of his deportation so he can attend his son's graduation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499673">What will the situation be after that? There will be another separated Canadian family, because Irina and Dmitri have been accepted to stay in Canada but Mikhail will be forced to leave. Another family will be in terrible distress.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499674">This family has huge community support. Four thousand people went on their Facebook site, and letters and petitions have come from Dmitri's school and from the community in support of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499675">This is a very simple matter. We need to support families. We need to make sure they have a successful life in Canada. We need to be careful before we engage in a removal process when it involves the spouse of a Canadian.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499676">This recommendation from the standing committee is very carefully constructed to deal with the important situations that families face. It merits the full support of the House.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1499677">Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague has been a passionate spokesman on the need to have a coherent immigration policy in this country, one that is not erratic, one where a person does not have to know the minister or somebody who will protect them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499678">Canadians who marry people who come to Canada and start to raise families, who are legitimate applicants and committed to building a life in Canada, should not be subjected to mean-spirited bureaucracy. Yet, we have seen the response this morning from the Conservatives, the sense of suspicion of the outsider, the hisses about how we have to track down spies and how people come here to rip off average Canadians. There is an old saying that “Tory times are always hard times”, and we certainly see that with this government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499679">However, the way the Conservatives are using it against Canadian families, against people who are building lives here, we see a sense of deep mistrust with that party. I would like to ask my hon. colleague if he senses this growing sense of power that the Conservatives can use against families who are relying on a system that is failing them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1499680">Mr. Speaker, I do not believe it is necessary to build walls around Canada to protect us from people who would flock here to somehow take advantage of us. When I hear about the need to protect the integrity of our immigration system, it somehow feels that it is the situation that is envisioned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499681">Most people, the vast majority, probably 99% of people who come to Canada, do so through the appropriate channels. We have to recognize that on a planet that has grown so small, where people move as freely as they do, often situations develop where relationships start and they do not necessarily conform to the kinds of bureaucratic arrangements or processes we have set in place. While we have that kind of freedom of movement around the planet, we have to deal with the situations that often present exceptions, or the need for an exception, to the strict application of our immigration law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499682">The committee has tried to say that those circumstances arise, they are completely legitimate, and here is a policy that will help us deal with them fairly and justly. The committee has been very careful to word the recommendation to do just that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1499683">Mr. Speaker, for this unfair, cruel and mean-spirited policy to continue, the Conservative government is really asking that when Canadians fall in love and decide to get married they should double-check to make sure the person is not of a precarious immigration status. If not, they will face many years of separation, hardship, financial difficulties, because the person would probably face deportation, even if they are married and the spouse is sponsoring them. That seems to be the message the Conservative government is pursuing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499684">With the kind of discussion we heard today, is that the message the Conservative government is sending, that if a person marries it is likely a marriage of convenience and the spouse should be deported, even though the application is proceeding, and there are really no grounds for compassion at all?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1499685">Mr. Speaker, we heard the situation of false marriages this morning in debate. I think that is a complete red herring. We are not talking about that with regard to this motion. In fact, this motion says that the application process will have to proceed. The common law or spousal sponsorship application has to proceed. The permanent residency application has to proceed. That is the appropriate place for those judgments to be made about whether it is a bona fide relationship or not. That is the place where those decisions will be made. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499686">To raise this as though this is somehow going to allow a whole bunch of fraudulent marriages to be recognized by Canada and our immigration system is completely wrong. The reality is that we do not ask for somebody's landed immigrant papers when we begin a relationship with them or fall in love with them. That would be utterly inappropriate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499687">Years ago, in my own life, I began a relationship with someone from another country. It was when I was a young man. It was a time when gay relationships were not accepted by our immigration policy. My partner and I could not figure out how to get over that problem of the border in terms of our own relationship. I see other people faced with that same circumstance of the border and the necessity for having legal status in a country. When I see that interfering with their relationship and their ability to form that relationship, to flourish in it and find it a home in Canada, I feel it very personally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499688">I let that relationship go, because I could not see a way around that particular problem. No one should have to make that kind of decision. When a person is beginning or trying to continue a relationship, they should have the support of the government and the people of Canada and not have road blocks thrown in their way.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1499690">I want the House to think about this. If in the first few months or years of his or her life a child faced a situation where the mother or father is cruelly separated from them, what would happen to the child?

              <ParaText id="1499695">That is exactly what the committee is saying with this policy change. It has been very conservative in how it has worded its recommendation to the government we are debating in the House this morning. The committee has looked at all the possible contingencies with regard to it. It has enumerated them in its motion and it has said this is an unacceptable situation for any Canadian family to face. Certainly, where there is a child involved, we know how important having a family is to the development of a child. I do not think there is any excuse for that.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1499697">Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak today on this very important issue. It occurred to me as I listen to the debate that our country truly is built upon immigration. I think of my riding of Thunder Bay—Rainy River and immigration through the last century in particular, right up to and including the 1980s and 1990s. Like most ridings, Thunder Bay—Rainy River is a very diverse riding with many people having arrived as newcomers. Some are first, second or third generation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499698">Throughout our long history of immigration in Canada we have gone to extremes at various times. On occasion we have had a very open door policy on immigration. At times we have closed the door. This is a very different situation we are faced with today. The bottom line of what we are talking about is the devastating impact on families. We should be doing everything we possibly can to ensure that families stay together and raise their families here. Quite frankly, this is what Canadians have done for more than a century. We have opened our doors to people from around the world and it is only in our recent history we have said to people that they will have to leave the country in 30 to 60 days. For most of our history we have had an open door policy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499699">The communities in my riding would never have been built had it not been for Italian immigrants, Ukrainian immigrants and immigrants from other parts of eastern and western Europe. It behooves us to think very carefully about the impact of presuming that people are guilty when they arrive in our country, presuming that people are ne'er-do-wells, that people are here for fraudulent reasons. Granted, there may be an occasional case where that is true, but that is dealt with in the usual manner. What happens is that 99% of others are penalized. It is a question of fairness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499700">Imagine coming to this country looking for a better opportunity, looking to contribute to society and in the course of being here for six months, a year or two years, falling in love and starting to raise a family. Then the government says that one member of the family has to leave this country. In some cases a mother and children may get to stay in the country, but the husband has to leave. It is a very long and involved process to get back again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499701">I am not suggesting that the government should not remain vigilant against fraudulent immigration, but I am suggesting to the government that the instances are very, very few. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1499702">Canada has a strange policy in that it would deport one spouse. It is hard to believe that Canada will actually deport the person with the precarious status, even though that person is married to a Canadian. As my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128233" Type="2">Trinity—Spadina</Affiliation> said earlier today, the woman might be pregnant, or breastfeeding a baby or has other children. She could be deported, not her children. Sometimes it is the mom, sometimes it is the dad who is deported, but it breaks up the family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499703">In the last 10 to 15 years in this country everyone talks about the importance of the family and family values. Here is a situation where quite purposefully families are being split up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499704">It might take a year or two, sometimes a shorter period and sometimes a longer period, for the deported person to come back to Canada. For a couple that has just been married or has only been married for a year or two, to face separation for an extended period of time simply is not fair. Fairness is really what we are talking about today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499705">On top of that, the couple may have to pay thousands and thousands of dollars in legal fees and so on. If the person comes from a part of the world that is very expensive to travel to, there are those expenses as well. It may be tens of thousands of dollars before the situation is resolved. Is that fair?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499706">Not only is it hard on the couple, but it is hard on the Canadian public when we consider the government resources that are being used, the tax dollars that are being spent to make all of this happen, when it would be quite simple to say, “Until things are resolved, we are not going to do anything. Just continue to stay with your family. Stay with your spouse. Stay with your children”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499707">In my riding offices, I do not deal with a lot of immigration issues. However, when I do, I would like to say that the government has been very cooperative in terms of helping me sort out these problems for constituents. When I say that, it astounds me even more that we are even having this discussion today, because it seems to me that we use a whole lot of government resources to sort out things that should not have to be sorted out in the first place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499708">I would like to conclude by suggesting that this immigration policy has a devastating effect on many Canadians and their loved ones. I am very pleased to have had the opportunity to express my dissatisfaction.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1499709">Mr. Speaker, like my hon. colleague's riding, my riding also was built mostly by immigrants. A lot of immigrants came to Nickel Belt in the 1940s and 1950s.

              <ParaText id="1499712">Mr. Speaker, absolutely. My experience has been that some cases, complicated or not, take a long period of time and some take a shorter period of time to get resolved. A good example in my riding is a short-order cook from mainland China who was here on a work permit and needed that permit extended. Quite frankly, the immigration department acted very quickly to make that happen. There was no shortfall or period of time when he was unable to work in the country. Otherwise, he would have been sent home. We have those kinds of cases, but we also have other cases that are very complicated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499713">I would like to say in response that our public service is fabulous. Canada's public service employees work hard and as well as they can within the rules, but sometimes the rules are not proper and need to be changed.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1499714">Mr. Speaker, there is a well-known cartoon that is not very funny. It depicts four people getting off a boat and the person who is second in line says to the person who is third in line while pointing to the person still on the boat, “Watch it, that guy is going to steal your job”. Unfortunately, that seems to be some of the history of immigration in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499715">Many of us are children and grandchildren of immigrants. My grandmother was a mining widow who came over from the old country. My grandfather came over here on short-term work contracts. Why did he come to Canada? He said he was not going to die in a rich man's war. Immigrants were hired in those days because they took the hardest and most dangerous jobs. However, if they spoke out, they often were deported.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499716">When the reunification of families was started back then, that is what built communities. It turned mining camps into towns, which turned into cities. The children of those immigrants ended up as doctors and lawyers. We can look across northern Ontario at the incredible wealth that came out of those immigrant communities because the first generation, in the case of the gold mines, pretty much laid down their lives for the next generation to succeed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499717">Yet today we are talking about immigration and families in which one spouse is Canadian, a child is born in Canada and there are arbitrary deportations. In a sense these people are being treated as guilty unless they go back to a country of origin, spend thousands of dollars and are dislocated from their families for years on end. That is how they prove their innocence. I would suggest that there is something fundamentally wrong in a system when people can be treated in such a cavalier and arbitrary fashion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499718">My colleague spoke earlier about the excellent work of the civil service. I certainly agree with him. The immigration teams in northern Ontario are underfunded and we need more of them. They do excellent work, but it is not an issue of civil servants. It is an issue of a government's attitude toward how it deals with one of our greatest resources, which is the immigrants who built this country. Does the member think the government's attitude toward immigration is failing and hurting Canadian families?</ParaText>

I thank her for the work she does day in and day out on the immigration committee and in the House, raising issues of importance to all of us, issues around a fundamental policy direction that is so important to our country's identity and to the future of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499721">The motion before us has to do with the work of the immigration committee, dealing with a very specific situation, and that is when an individual in our country wants to marry or form a partnership with another person who does not have landed status. That relationship is then made to suffer by a mean-spirited, outdated rule that says the spouse, the partner, cannot work in the country and must either wait it out and not contribute to the economic viability of that person's family or else face deportation, or removal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499722">This is clearly an issue that gets at the very heart of who we are as a country and what it means. We have a policy that says that family reunification is the bedrock of this society. All of us believe that. We hear it day in and day out in this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499723">Therefore, we want to ensure our policies reflect that fundamental belief that the family unit is respected, that we encourage families to come together to support one another, that we ensure the family is supported so every individual who is part of that unit has the emotional, economic and social backup and background required to fulfill their lifelong ambitions and make their unique contribution to our society today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499724">From our point of view, there is no place in our immigration policy for a punitive approach, which says “If you want to get married, you can't work here and you've got to go back home and wait it out”. Does that make sense, if we say that the bedrock of our society is family, that the bedrock of Canadian society is our multicultural fabric? We cannot have it both ways. We cannot on the one hand tout the beauties of this nation in terms of our ethnocultural diversity and then deny someone who is in love, who wants to form a permanent relationship with someone else, the right to stay here and make a living and not be removed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499725">It is not like this policy will cost a lot of money. It is will not hurt our society. It will not diminish anyone's contribution here now. It can only do the opposite. It enhances quality of life. It strengthens the family. It shows to the world that we are truly a humanitarian and compassionate nation open to people from around the world who want to come to our country and make a difference, who want to start a new life and use their talents to the fullest potential possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499726">We are here today trying to advance something that the immigration committee has dealt with and to win the support of the government of the day to change this silly policy, a policy that stands in the way of family reunification, a policy that stands in the way of our belief that we gain strength from our diversity.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1499727">We have had a long, hard battle in this place to try to put family reunification to the top of the immigration agenda. Long before the Conservatives, we battled the Liberals. We tried every way we could to convince the Liberals, when they were in government, to change some of our immigration policies so we could actually show we were truly serious about family reunification and about progressive immigration.</ParaText>

We said over and over again that the government should broaden the policy to allow immigrants to sponsor not only a family member who was part of that nice, neat, tight definition of family, which is mother, father, grandparents, children, but also sisters, brothers, uncles, aunts, nieces and nephews.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499729">We proposed something that was very constructive and very reasonable. We did not say that we should open the family category up entirely forever and a day and see what happened. We said that we should do it carefully, slowly and cautiously and allow every immigrant in the country to sponsor, once in their lifetime, a member of their family who was not now part of the family definition. That was very reasonable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499730">It would not open the floodgates, as some of the Liberals tried to suggest it would. It would not bankrupt the country. It would simply be a way to strengthen family and to allow people to come to this country who would not otherwise be able to, thereby strengthening the economic fabric of our country and strengthening the foundation, the bedrock of our society, the family unit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499731">Here we are today debating something that should be self-evident, that should be automatically dealt with, but we are finding more resistance. Just like we found resistance from the Liberals year after year when they were in government, we are now facing resistance from a government that has once again adopted this very narrow approach to immigration, a very rigid approach which denies that fundamental notion of bringing family together and allowing people who are part of that family unit to contribute to the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499732">Why, in this time of economic difficulty, when we need people to fill a labour shortage, when we find it hard to in fact grow the economy, would we not encourage anyone who is here legitimately and wants to form a permanent relationship and a partnership to work? Why would we say that person cannot contribute economically? Those people can sit here and wait it out or they can go back home, where the wait is long, hard, trying and hurtful to the relationship and to the family unit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499733">We have heard from many of my colleagues, who have had numerous cases along these lines. I, too, have dealt with constituents who have come to me and said that they are about to be married, that they are engaged. They have said that it is a long wait while they go through the process, but they need to make a living, they want to contribute economically and be a part of Canadian society. However, they cannot afford to simply sit it out either in this country or back in their homeland.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499734">We have people who have talent, skills, initiative and abilities, people who can make a difference to our communities, people who have much to offer, yet we tell them, even if they are engaged to be married or are part of a common law relationship, if they have not gone through all the hoops and waited all the years, they cannot work. We are saying is that the test should be the relationship and how serious it is. Is it real? There are many tests to determine that.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1499735">The Conservative government, just like the Liberal government before, will test all people who says they have been legitimately married. People are questioned time and time again about the legitimacy of their marriage and put through all kinds of hoops and obstacles, troubles and trials, just to prove they are legitimately married. We deal with that every day, especially with people who come from Punjab, where arranged marriages are the order of the day. Many times immigration officials question whether that marriage, that relationship, is genuine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499736">There are ways. Those couples have to go through all kinds of paperwork and have to demonstrate the absolute sincerity of their relationship and prove that there is a solid, firm basis upon which they come together. We can do that without preventing someone from contributing to the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499737">I think it is self-evident. It only makes sense, if we are serious about immigration, to do this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499738">The once-in-a-lifetime idea, which the Liberals quashed before the Conservatives came to power and which is still not one favoured by the government, is alive and well on our part. We will continue to push for this idea. It is fundamental to what we believe is important for our country, family being the bedrock of society and our belief that our country is only strengthened by our multicultural mosaic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499739">I regret some of the talk that has emerged of late, which suggests we should be more like the Americans, a melting pot of our societies as opposed to a mosaic. I come from a constituency that is one of the most diverse ethnocultural areas in the country. It is nothing but a place of strength for the community and for all of us. The richness that we get from that kind of diversity, the contribution that is made by Filipino Canadians, Sikh Canadians, Polish Canadians, Ukrainian Canadians, Portuguese Canadians, and the list goes on and on, cannot be measured in real terms because it far exceeds the enrichment to our society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499740"> I hope the government is not pursuing this line of thinking too much. It would be absolutely wrong to deny our rich history. It should not build on this idea that we are a mosaic. We are not a melting pot.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499741">On that basis, I also suggest the government finally do something the Liberals would not do, which is to allow for a proper appeal procedure for refugees. The Immigration Act was passed while the Liberals were in government. We tried to convince them to implement, at the same time that the legislation was proclaimed, an appeal for the refugee process. That was denied. To this day, we still do not have an appeal process for refugees coming to this country. What a violation of our understanding of human rights. What a backward notion that has been advanced by the Liberals, and now the Conservatives. I hope we can finally see the light of day and put in place a proper appeal procedure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499742">I might add, when the Liberals were in power and we were engaged in revamping our Immigration Act to bring it into the modern century, many pieces were left undone, many clauses were not changed. We had issues around the live-in caregiver policy. We raised concerns about the protection of live-in caregivers and nannies and the Liberals would not address it. Now the current government will not address it. We raised questions about the appeal process. We raised questions about the once-in-a-lifetime immigration proposal. We raised questions about ensuring that families with children with disabilities would not be barred from our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499743"> However, the Liberals refused to do anything about those very good ideas. They refused to adopt those amendments. As a result, they set the stage for the Conservatives to do what they are naturally inclined to do, and that is to be hard on immigrants, to be harsh in terms of their judgment, to deny people when they ought to be given some ability to come to this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499744">Time and time again we have dealt with families that have been accepted here because of their economic contribution, but then they are turned away because one of their children has a disability. When we raised this with the Liberals a number of years ago, they told us not to worry, that it would never be used for that kind of approach. Look at what the Liberals have done. They have set the stage for a government that does not have the openness to a compassionate, humanitarian immigration policy and we are all now paying the consequences.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1499745">Instead of being a light in the world, instead of being a beacon of hope for immigrants and refugees around the world, we are now seen as becoming more and more hardline, restrictive and narrow in our approach, having lost our humanitarian compassion and tradition that is part of who we are as Canadians. I urge all members to support the motion and to get on with building a country that is founded and continues to grow on the basis of our pride in our ethnocultural diversity.</ParaText>

The petitioners point out that the violence against workers and members of civil society by paramilitaries in Colombia, who are very closely associated with the current government, has been ongoing with more than 2,200 trade unionists murdered since 1991. They point out that the side agreements, whether labour or the environment, are not effective and that the whole trade agreement is based on NAFTA which has not been effective in protecting labour or environmental rights. In Mexico, for example, over a million agricultural jobs have been lost since NAFTA was signed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499760">It also points out that the murder of labour and human rights activists has increased in 2008 in Colombia, and widespread and very serious human rights violations continue to be a daily reality. The labour protection clause in the trade deal includes a penalty for lethal violence against workers, however, this is a token fine to be paid by the offending government into a cooperative fund which makes a mockery of human rights. Therefore, the petitioners ask Parliament to reject the Canada-Colombia trade deal until an independent human rights impact assessment is carried out.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1499778">Mr. Speaker, I believe we are all on the same page. It is a pleasure to speak to the third reading of Bill <Document DbId="3831702" Type="3">C-28</Document>. Certainly, it is no mystery by now why I support this bill, nor why the hon. members of the House have united to ensure that this bill passes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499779">Bill <Document DbId="3831702" Type="3">C-28</Document> begins a new chapter in one of the country's great aboriginal success stories: the story of the Cree of Eeyou Istchee. For hundreds of years, the Cree peoples of the eastern James Bay and southern Hudson Bay region of northern Quebec have effectively protected their environment, managed their natural resources, and preserved the cultural legacy of their communities. For decades, the Cree of Eeyou Istchee have used the provisions in the James Bay and Northern Quebec agreement to start their own airline, establish a thriving construction company, and open many flourishing small businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499780">Most recently, the Cree of Eeyou Istchee have engaged in ongoing consultations with Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, embraced genuine partnership with the Government of Canada, and co-signed the 2008 new relationship agreement document. These are the achievements I would like to focus on today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499781">For those not familiar with the new relationship agreement, allow me to explain a few important facts about this document. The new relationship agreement is a landmark agreement between the Government of Canada and the Cree of Eeyou Istchee. It is a historic consensus that gets at the heart of what it takes to build strong communities. It resolves past grievances. It fosters social and economic development. It empowers people to determine their own destinies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499782">More specifically, the new relationship agreement ends litigation initiated by the Cree of Eeyou Istchee against the federal government, devolves specific federal responsibilities to the nine Cree communities of the eastern James Bay and southern Hudson Bay region, and provides for amendments to the Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act to enable the Cree regional authority to enact bylaws that will apply throughout the region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499783">Significantly, the new relationship agreement does all of this with the full support of the Cree of Eeyou Istchee. Voicing their opinions in referendum, more than 90% of the beneficiaries who voted in the nine affected communities endorsed the agreement. They voted to end years of contention and uncertainty, and to embrace a sincere partnership with the Government of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499784">Bill <Document DbId="3831702" Type="3">C-28</Document> fulfills two key aspects of the agreement. First, it will equip the Cree regional authority with additional responsibilities and powers, including bylaw-making powers, so that the Cree regional authority will be better able to carry out certain specified responsibilities that were assumed from the federal government under the James Bay and Northern Quebec agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499785">Bill C-28 also sets the stage for the negotiation of a Cree nation governance agreement that will establish a new Cree nation government. As the Cree of Eeyou Istchee noted in their presentation to the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, this bill constitutes “another step in the evolution of Cree governance structures and responsibilities”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499786">Second, it will incorporate the Cree of Oujé-Bougoumou as the ninth Cree band. This is a fulfillment of the 1992 Ouje-Bougoumou/Canada Agreement, under which the Government of Canada agreed to recognize the Cree of Oujé-Bougoumou as the ninth Cree band and to contribute financially toward the creation of a new village at Lake Opemiska.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499787">In the words of Mr. Richard Saunders, who represented the Cree-Naskapi Commission before the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, this is both “a symbolic and housekeeping amendment”. It is one that acknowledges the local government and administration of a distinct people not named in the James Bay and Northern Quebec agreement.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1499788">In short, Bill <Document DbId="3831702" Type="3">C-28</Document> fulfills two key aspects of the new relationship agreement that would enable all of us, the Cree of Eeyou Istchee and the Government of Canada, to place our focus squarely on the future. It is a bill that dwells not on recriminations of the past but on opportunities in the present and future. It is a bill that honours the spirit of partnership and collaboration inherent in the new relationship agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499789">Throughout the bill's development, from the initial outline to the version before us today, the Cree of Eeyou Istchee have been extensively consulted. They have helped ensure the bill meets the real needs of the Cree communities of northern Quebec. They have advised the government on necessary changes and they have contributed at key stages of the legislative process. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499790">Due in no small part to the Cree's involvement, members of the House now have the opportunity to truly serve the Cree people who live in the James Bay and southern Hudson Bay region to give them the authority to: enforce strict water quality standards; to maintain meticulous accounting practices and guarantee that people in positions of power are held accountable for their use of community funds; and to ensure more responsive police and firefighting services and make certain that all residents in crises get the emergency help they need. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499791">This is an opportunity to encourage continued dialogue between the Government of Canada and the Cree of Eeyou Istchee and to ensure that our nation's laws benefit the people most affected by them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499792">This is our time to seize these opportunities. Let us help honour the commitments the Government of Canada made to the Cree people of northern Quebec in the new relationship agreement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499793">We are ready to heed the words of Richard Saunders, Philip Awashish and Robert Kanatewat who travelled to Ottawa on behalf of the Cree of Eeyou Istchee to outline their support for the bill when they appeared before the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development just a short time ago. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499794">Passage of the bill would enable the Cree of Eeyou Istchee to pave the way to a brighter and more prosperous future for their communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499795">As we heard earlier in the House and again at committee, all parties in the House support the bill. There is no one who does not wish to establish a new relationship based on trust, fairness and mutual respect. There is no one who does not wish to welcome the nine Cree communities in northern Quebec into the political, social and economic conversations that will shape the future of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499796">I know that is why my colleagues will welcome the opportunity, as I do, to vote in favour of this important legislation, to vote in favour of helping thousands of proud, resourceful, ambitious people in nine remote communities in northern Quebec to embark on a prosperous future and on a path to a new tomorrow for us all.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1499797">Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Liberal Party of Canada, I am glad to stand in the House and support Bill <Document DbId="3831702" Type="3">C-28</Document>, and act to amend the Cree-Naskapi Act of 1984.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499798">The numerous benefits of this legislation have already been read into the record. The bill is now at third reading and hopefully it will get royal assent in the not too distant future, after some 33 years of intense negotiation and, at many times, litigation, and not always an amicable relationship between the Crown, whether provincial or federal, and the aboriginal people involved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499799">A lot of work has been undertaken over those 33 years since 1975 when we had the James Bay and northern Quebec agreement, the northeastern Quebec agreement in 1979 and then the Cree-Naskapi Act in 1984, which is what the bill we are talking about today would amend.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499800">Since 1984, the Cree people have been in a tangle with the federal government about the true implementation of the Cree-Naskapi Act of 1984. They have tried diligently to ensure that land claims were implemented, not only in terms of the details of that particular land claim but in terms of the spirit and intent of it. A new relationship agreement was signed in 2008, which is the basis of what we are dealing with here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499801">The agreement itself was spoken of in endearing terms by Bill Namagoose at committee, who was one of the chief negotiators of that particular deal. We also heard from the minister and the department about how the relationship between the Department of Justice, the federal Crown and the Crees of Eeyou Istchee was much improved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499802">One of the lawyers at the time said that he had been practising for 43 years and that it was the first time in those 43 years that he could actually commend the people from the Department of Justice for the way they had behaved, for their manners and for their professionalism, and he hoped that particular relationship would continue into the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499803">I want to read into the record a couple of quotes about land claims and speak in terms of going forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499804">The Supreme Court of Canada, in Haida Nation v. British Columbia, Minister of Forests, wrote:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499805">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The historical roots of the principle of the honour of the Crown suggest that it must be understood generously in order to reflect the underlying realities from which it stems. In all its dealings with Aboriginal peoples, from the assertion of sovereignty to the resolution of claims and the implementation of treaties, the Crown must act honourably. Nothing less is required if we are to achieve “the reconciliation of the pre-existence of Aboriginal societies with the sovereignty of the Crown. </QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499806">On the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms, the report on Canada in 2004 around the settling of comprehensive land claims, the United Nations special rapporteur said:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499807">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The settling of comprehensive land claims and self-government agreements (such as those of Nunavut or James Bay) are important milestones in the solution of outstanding human rights concerns of Aboriginal people. They do not, in themselves, resolve many of the human rights grievances afflicting Aboriginal communities and do require more political will regarding implementation, responsive institutional mechanisms, effective dispute resolution mechanisms, and stricter monitoring procedures at all levels. </QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499808">What is being said here is that the Crown must act honourably when signing treaties and must implement not only the letter of the treaties but the spirit and intent of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499809">Some of the most formidable work being done today around the implementation of land claims is coming from the Land Claims Agreements Coalition, which is made up of basically all of the modern treaty-holders from Labrador to B.C. and from Yukon to Nunavut.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1499810">Members of this coalition underlined four undertakings that the Government of Canada should put in place regarding treaty implementation. They are calling upon the Government of Canada to adopt a new policy on the full implementation of modern treaties between aboriginal peoples and the Crown. They also ask that the Government of Canada draft and promptly introduce legislation to establish a land claims agreements implementation commission, that the Government of Canada establish a cabinet committee on aboriginal affairs to oversee and coordinate the full involvement of federal agencies and ongoing treaty implementation activities, and that the periodic negotiation of implementation funding for Canada's obligations under modern land claims agreements be led by a chief federal negotiator appointed jointly by the <Affiliation DbId="111551" Type="4">Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development</Affiliation> and the Land Claims Agreement Coalition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499811">Those are very practical solutions and they arise out of the context of the James Bay and northern Quebec agreement of 1975. They arise out of the historical context that has led, after 33 years, to the Cree-Naskapi 1984 amendments that we are talking about today. The coalition members cite this as movement in the right direction, which we in our party agree with as well. they also understand that across the country there are outstanding grievances within first nations, Inuit and some Métis communities around the implementation of land claims. They call for this way forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499812">I will not prolong the debate on third reading except to say that my party supports this because it is a way forward. We also support it because it was a collaborative approach. We cannot say that strongly enough. It was a collaborative approach between the Government of Canada and aboriginal peoples who sat at the table. They will not call it co-drafting because they say that legally we cannot co-draft but that is a purview of the federal government itself. In essence, they basically dotted the <I>i</I>'s and crossed the <I>t</I>'s and said that this was a nice way to go forward and the government says that it is its legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499813">I will say this in another context because we have another bill before the House called Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document>, which was not co-drafted, was not done in co-operation or consultation with first nations people and is not receiving the kind of unanimity within the House that we see on Bill <Document DbId="3831702" Type="3">C-28</Document>. The difference in approach has an impact on the content and the agreement that various parties can reach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499814">We are supporting Bill <Document DbId="3831702" Type="3">C-28</Document> because of the process and the content. I wish the Cree of Eeyou Istchee good luck with this. We wish them the best and the Liberal Party will certainly be a partner in the future as this agreement and other agreements are implemented under the new relationship.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="128557" Type="2">Mr. Marc Lemay (Abitibi—Témiscamingue, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1499815">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise here today at third reading of this bill, one that is extremely important for the Cree community and other closely related communities, particularly, the Naskapi. We are talking about a region in Quebec. The last time I addressed the House concerning this bill, I paid a tribute, and I would like to do so again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499816">I also emphasized the geographic importance of the James Bay Cree. There are nine Cree communities. For those watching us, we are talking about the nine communities near James Bay, and the people who have always lived in those communities. The Government of Quebec is currently beginning, or rather it began a few years ago, major works projects there to build hydroelectric dams.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499817">I would therefore like to pay tribute to Matthew Mukash, Grand Chief and President of the Grand Council of the Crees (Eeyou Istchee), that is, the Cree government. He worked very hard to put this very lengthy agreement in place. This Bill <Document DbId="3831702" Type="3">C-28</Document> is minor compared to the agreement that was reached, one that will have extremely important repercussions for the Cree community and those who live in the areas around those communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499818">Matthew Mukash was and still is the grand chief; Ashley Iserhoff is the deputy grand chief and vice-chairman; Roderick Pachano is the authorized representative of the Cree Nation of Chisasibi; Losty Mamianskum is the authorized representative of the Whapmagoostui First Nation; Rodney Mark is the representative of the Cree Nation of Wemindji; Lloyd Mayappo is from the Eastmain Band; Steve Diamond is the authorized representative of the Crees of the Waskaganish First Nation; Josie Jimiken is from the Cree Nation of Nemaska; John Kitchen is from the Waswanipi Band; John Longchap is from the Cree Nation of Mistissini; Louise Wapachee is from the Oujé-Bougoumou Eenuch Association.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499819">These people represent all of the communities that have signed this extremely important agreement, which, while not necessarily making the Crees independent in the fullest sense of the word, will enable them to benefit from a degree of self-determination and distance from the federal government with respect to the management of their everyday affairs. Under this agreement, they will be able to ensure that their communities receive appropriate services, such as health and sanitation services. They will decide where to build their communities' hospitals. We know that many of these communities, which are located on the shores of James Bay, ranging almost as far as the Inuit communities of Quebec's far north, are isolated from one another and often have trouble working together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499820">This bill, this agreement, will enable them to work together. The Cree Regional Authority will have the opportunity to develop programs and ensure that it has everything it needs to achieve the independence of Cree first nations. Under this agreement, they will be responsible for protecting the environment and preventing pollution. We know what is going on with the Cree nation and the development of hydroelectric dams on James Bay. Over the next few years, mining exploration and exploitation will increase dramatically. Companies are looking northward more than ever before for mining exploration and exploitation opportunities. The Cree people will have to implement policies to protect their environment. That is what they wanted, that is what they asked for in committee, and that is what they will get with this bill, which will be passed just minutes from now.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1499821">In terms of administration, they will also be responsible for justice. That is extremely important. The administration of justice has always posed a problem in the north. For many years, the itinerant court has travelled to Cree communities to dispense justice. There were no court houses and often community centres were used.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499822">Under this agreement, moneys will be allocated. When we refer to an agreement, we are also referring to the moneys that will be allocated and transferred to the Cree for the administration of justice, social development, and above all, economic development. One of the difficulties is that the Cree are isolated. There is little work. The birth rate is 3.5% per year, a veritable population explosion. Therefore appropriate measures are needed, including the creation of towns and the construction of houses suitable for the conditions of the community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499823">Indian and Northern Affairs Canada has often sent houses that developed mould or were destroyed because they did not provide what the Cree needed to survive in a difficult environment, one that all too often is a hostile environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499824">It has been noted that this agreement will benefit the Cree. After royal assent has been given, the amount of $100 million will be paid to the Cree. The $100 million has already been committed. That is why we, the Bloc Québécois, pushed for and will support this very important bill. Moneys have been committed, work has begun, and very important infrastructure—community centres, CLSCs and hospitals—must be built. The time to do that is now—May, June, July, August and September. We have five months to do some very important work. The amounts to be disbursed will pay for work that has already started and is very important to the community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499825">This bill will also—I realize that this is somewhat complex for those listening—settle the matter of land categories for which the communities had the authority to establish bylaws, municipal regulations to set limits as to time of day and year for hunting, trapping and fishing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499826">There are three categories of land: categories I, II and lll. From now on, category III will cover 911,000 square kilometres where communities will participate in the administration and development of the land. It will be very important for the Cree to start right now on working to identify controlled harvesting zones. There might also be—and we hope there will be—a little more respect for the flora and fauna than at present. That is our hope for these category III lands.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499827">The act also makes modifications to category IA lands, where federal laws and regulations apply.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1499828">The Cree will therefore be the ones responsible for administration of these lands and they will ensure that they come under their jurisdiction and that the bylaws they enact to protect the flora and fauna can be respected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499829">Clause 9 of the bill sets out new provisions which will enable the Cree Regional Authority to enact bylaws and resolutions within the territorial limits of category IA and III lands. This is extremely complex, I know, but this is such an important bill for the nine Cree communities which will at last be able to take over their space.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499830">I sense, Mr. Speaker, that you are wanting to interrupt me for question period or something else but I have so much still to say that I will, unfortunately for you, be back after question period.</ParaText>

Last week we made a formal request to the <Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4">justice minister</Affiliation>. To date there has not yet been a response.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1499839">Forty-three per cent of those 520 cases have occurred just since the year 2000, a phenomenon that appears to be rising as more women go missing, three in Manitoba in the past year alone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1499840">Aboriginal women deserve no less concern, no fewer investigations and no less protection than all women in Canada. We believe the government must act to answer the questions of why this is happening, why the investigations are falling short, and why the women and their families are not being acknowledged. They deserve no less. It is time. Canadians deserve no less. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1500096">Mr. Speaker, it is a relief when calm returns to this place. It is too bad that people sometimes get carried away in question period. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500097"> Now, back to the work at hand, which I find much more interesting than question period. I refer to Bill <Document DbId="3831702" Type="3">C-28</Document> concerning Cree and native communities in northern Quebec. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500098"> As I have eight minutes left, and now one less, I would like to point out that the bill is in negotiation. The agreement has been in negotiation since 1984. Following the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement, it took nine years for discussions to begin to reach the agreement signed by representatives of the nine Cree communities and the Government of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500099"> The agreement will give greater autonomy to the Cree and the Naskapi, in fact, more to the Cree than to the Naskapi because there is still room for an agreement with the Naskapi. The lands of these two communities overlap and so an agreement with the Naskapi is required as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500100"> The land mentioned in the agreement overlaps part of the land of the Inuit in Quebec, but, overall, the James Bay Cree should end up with full autonomy with regard to the Canadian government through the agreement. Accordingly, the Cree Regional Authority will be able to take over the federal government's responsibilities under the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500101"> It was in fact essential for the Cree to come to an agreement with the federal government and with the Quebec government pursuant to the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement. It appears that these agreements are now complete and finalized. We can very soon allow the Cree to move to full autonomy over their ancestral land. This is the intent of Bill <Document DbId="3831702" Type="3">C-28</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500102"> We will support this bill because we consider it important to support autonomy and the native peoples. The Bloc has always recognized that native peoples are distinct and have a right to their culture, language, customs and traditions and to choose the way their identity will be developed. That is what is happening with this bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500103"> I do not have a lot of time left, but I want to emphasize before the House that when the government can and wants to, it is possible to reach agreements with native peoples. I believe that this agreement with the Cree paves the way for further agreements. What we would most like to see are further agreements with the Innu, Algonquin, Attikamek and Naskapi so that aboriginal communities not only have rights and responsibilities but are also allowed to develop in accordance with their ancestral customs on their ancestral lands. That is what this bill will achieve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500104"> We should remember that there was a Cree-Naskapi Commission, which made a number of recommendations.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="15">(1515)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1500105"> There were 20 of them, and I would like to highlight a few: full and explicit recognition of the inherent right of Eeyou self-government—that is what this bill provides; recognition of the existence and application of Eeyou traditional law, customs and practices in the exercise and practice of Eeyou self-government; and elimination of provisions that conflict with Eeyou traditional law, customs and practices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500106"> All that will be achieved, therefore, on their lands. I read only three of the 20 recommendations. The important thing is that henceforth they will be self-governing and will have jurisdiction over their ancestral lands, which will enable the Cree to develop. The Eeyou community will also be able to develop in accordance with its customs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500107"> We think, therefore, that this is an excellent bill. When the government wants to, it can sit down at the table. It should do the same in regard to Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document> on matrimonial rights in aboriginal communities. This bill has been severely criticized by all feminist organizations and aboriginal associations and communities. We think the government should go back to the drawing board and introduce a new Bill C-8.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500108"> We hope, in conclusion, that Bill <Document DbId="3831702" Type="3">C-28</Document> passes quickly so that Cree community self-government can be established. We hope this government develops in accordance with the ancestral customs of the Cree. I can only hope one more thing: that this entente cordiale between the Cree and the federal government proves sustainable and leads to the development of these communities, which are located in a part of the country where life is not easy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500109"> I wish them, therefore, the best of luck. I hope that the wishes and desires of the Cree communities which signed the agreement leading to Bill <Document DbId="3831702" Type="3">C-28</Document> will all be realized. It is the Bloc’s greatest hope that the Cree communities joined together in the Grand Council of the Crees achieve their independence, live finally in accordance with their traditional customs on their own lands, develop themselves and administer what is lawfully theirs, that is to say, their ancestral territory.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1500111"> I want to provide a bit of background because the amendment has been in the works for a number of years. There is a long history around the Cree Naskapi in Quebec. The James Bay and Northern Québec Agreement was signed in 1975 and was Canada's first modern land claims settlement. However, this settlement was an outstanding Cree and Inuit claim to aboriginal rights and titles dating back to the 1800s. The agreement should have been signed a century or more before, but it took from some time in the 1800s until 1975 to have an agreement put in place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500112">I am from British Columbia and although some land claims agreements have been signed, many nations there are still without those kinds of agreements. Something has been put in place in British Columbia called the common table and roughly 60 nations have signed on to the unity protocol. If we can have the kind of movement on treaties and land claims that we have seen around the amendments to the Cree-Naskapi Act, that would be a welcome opportunity in B.C.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500113">As to the history around this agreement, in 1975, when the province of Quebec announced its intention to develop the hydroelectric potential in the James Bay region, the commitment to recognize Cree and Inuit rights had not yet been fulfilled by the federal and provincial governments. Court injunctions were put in place in order to push back on the fact that the Cree and Inuit had not been consulted. Ultimately, it culminated in the James Bay and Northern Québec Agreement, but that agreement was negotiated without any implementation plan. It continued for many more years.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1500121">I want to backtrack a little. In February 2002, the province of Quebec and the Crees signed the agreement respecting a new relationship between the Government of Quebec and the Cree of Quebec, known as the Paix des Braves. The Cree agreed to discontinue most of their court cases against Quebec and suspend others with respect to matters shared with the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500122">This agreement eventually led to this new relationships agreement. Although it is not part of this legislation, it was a new relationship between the Government of Canada and the Cree of Eeyou Istchee. This was an important document because chapter 3 of this new relationship agreement outlined a two-stage process that would look at the implementation of some of the previous agreement that was signed.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1500123">This new relationship agreement includes a mutually agreed upon James Bay and northern Quebec implementation plan for the next 20 years, resolution of pre-litigation and other grievances, in addition to a phased approach toward Cree governance modernization.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500124">At the heart of this what we have in the bill before us is only part of what needs to happen. Bill <Document DbId="3831702" Type="3">C-28</Document> is only stage one. The commitment in the new relationship agreement said that within 18 months roughly this amendment to the Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act would be brought forward as part one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500125"> Bill <Document DbId="3831702" Type="3">C-28</Document> would carry out two main objectives. One would be to equip the Cree Regional Authority with additional responsibilities and powers, including bylaw making powers, so that the authority would be better able to receive and carry out certain specified responsibilities which are assumed by the federal government under the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement and recognize the Crees of Oujé-Bougoumou as a separate band and local government under the Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500126">We have heard across the board that the nations involved in this and the other nations that are on the other aspects of this agreement are all in agreement that this has to happen. There is full support for the Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act amendments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500127">The next stage, on which all parties have agreed there is a process in place, is that within three to five years another set of amendments would be brought forward to look at the autonomous governance structure that the Crees are fully entitled to have put in place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500128">Prior to colonization, the Cree nations were an autonomous nation. They had full control over their social, economic and, I would argue, environmental issues, because they were the stewards of the land. They were a fully functioning government structure. Part of this agreement examines the changes that need to be put in place for part two.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500129">We have had assurances from the government and some comfort from the Cree nations that they feel confident that this process will be in place to see these part two amendments come forward within three to five years. I am sure all members of this House would welcome that. Sadly, it took 19 years to get this first set of amendments in place, but they are before us now and we are fully supportive of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500130">Part of what was successful was the consultation process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500131"> I want to backtrack for a moment and mention the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Although Canada has not signed on to this aspirational document, I think it does include a framework that is important for us to reflect upon when we are talking about indigenous peoples, first nations peoples, first peoples of this country.

              <ParaText id="1500134">At committee we heard that the Department of Justice was involved with Indian and Northern Affairs right from the outset.

              <ParaText id="1500137">With respect to the consultation process, the briefing documents acknowledge that under the new relationship agreement, the Government of Canada is obliged to consult with the Grand Council of the Crees. That in itself is progress. The government is acknowledging the need to consult.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500138">The briefing documents talk about what the consultation process looks like with the Cree. Meetings were held with the Cree, including the Crees of Oujé-Bougoumou, with their legal representatives throughout the drafting of the legislation which began in 2007. There were formal meetings, conference calls and many exchanges of letters and emails. Both the English and the French texts of the legislation were reviewed by the Cree. The Government of Canada considered all suggestions proposed by the Cree, and the input received was reflected in the proposed legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500139">That seems to be a very reasonable approach. We have legislation that has a direct impact on the lives of the people in the Cree communities. The Cree was an autonomous self-governing nation prior to colonial times. The Cree have the capability, the infrastructure, and the leadership in place to directly address the issues facing their communities. It would seem reasonable that when the government is drafting legislation that is going to have a direct impact on their communities that they would be included from the outset. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500140">We have seen success with this approach. Bill <Document DbId="3831702" Type="3">C-28</Document>, because of that very reasonable approach, has had rapid passage through the House and through the committee. The committee certainly heard from witnesses. We did our due diligence. We heard from witnesses who were being impacted by the legislation. We heard consistently that because of this reasonable process, people could sign on to it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500141">The Cree nations had an opportunity to take this back to their communities, because it was drafted in conjunction with them, get feedback and input, and suggest changes.

Under the old specific claims process, specific claims could languish in the Department of Justice for years without any decision being made. Again, it is a model I would urge the government to consider, to include the Department of Justice, and other departments, right up front. In some cases the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the Department of the Environment have a stake in whatever is under negotiation. It would be important to have them at the table right at the outset.</ParaText>

Both of those organizations do not support Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document>. They do not feel it reflects what they heard from the communities. In fact many of the recommendations that the ministerial representative and her team made, whose work I quoted from on the duty to consult, were not incorporated into Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500179">The minister came before the committee this morning and talked about what he saw as being important in Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document>, which is the ability to allow nations to develop their own codes around matrimonial real property, and that the current state of the Indian Act prevents him from doing that. I would suggest that the government could withdraw Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document> and reintroduce a bill that deals with the ability of nations to give the minister the authority under the Indian Act to have those codes developed.

              <ParaText id="1500185">We know that did not happen with Bill C-8. There was a very tight timeframe for the Assembly of First Nations and the Native Women's Association to start a process.

I want to congratulate her too on her French. I used to be able to say anything at all about her so long as it was in French, but I cannot do that any more. She has learned a lot from the James Bay Cree. If we look at what has been happening in Vancouver since she found out about the Cree, first nations issues have been settled much more easily. She can use Quebec’s experience with the first nations and apply it to British Columbia. The parliamentary secretary realized this and was actually quite happy about it, given the way he reacts when our colleague stands and speaks in the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500189"> I am very proud of the determination and pride of the Quebec Cree. I cannot speak for the Cree of Ontario or other provinces because, apart from the witnesses who appear before us in committee, I have not had much opportunity to talk to them. Generally speaking, though, the Cree rely a lot on the comprehension and understanding shown by the members of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development when they come to see us and try to make us grasp their problems and view of things, which is not necessarily our own. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500190"> For example, in regard to Bill C-28 before us today, we should not forget that the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement has been in negotiation since 1973. Negotiations started as far back as 1973, under René Lévesque, in connection with the James Bay power project. After the project was developed on their lands, the Cree decided to claim some of the benefits. We well remember how hard they had to fight, even going to New York, if I remember correctly, to assert their rights. <Document DbId="3831702" Type="3" /></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500191"> Bill C-28 arose pursuant to the promises Canada made in the subsequent agreements. Its purpose is to implement these promises: the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement, signed in 1975; the 1992 Oujé-Bougoumou/Canada Agreement, in which Canada promised to remedy the failure to include the Cree of Oujé-Bougoumou in the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement; the Cree and Naskapi legislation; and the 2008 Agreement concerning a New Relationship between the Government of Canada and the Cree of Eeyou Istchee, which reaffirmed the promise to give the Cree Regional Authority greater governance powers over the development of the James Bay Cree. I am very happy for the chief of Oujé-Bougoumou, whom I hold in high esteem. She is a very nice lady who has now become a very great lady. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500192"> As I just said, the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement has been in negotiation since 1973. It comes from the Eeyou Istchee Cree, which translates as the land of the Cree of James Bay, Quebec. The association of Inuit of New Quebec entered into negotiations with the Government of Quebec, the federal government, Hydro-Québec and the James Bay energy corporation. At that point, they focused on the regions and the people in them, recognizing and protecting certain rights and benefits. The negotiations concluded with the signing in 1975 of the James Bay agreement, the first comprehensive land claim agreement in Canada, which today is protected under the Constitution as a modern treaty, pursuant to section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. In this agreement, the Cree gave up, transferred and dropped all claims, rights, titles and native interests to and in the lands in the area and in Quebec in exchange for clearly defined rights and benefits. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1500193"> The James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement recognized eight bands. This land regime defined three categories of land. I will not enumerate them. In the 1975 agreement, with Oujé-Bougoumou not yet a reserve or even a recognized band, it had to fight until 1992 for recognition and to obtain its own village. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500194"> The current agreement comes under the heading of local administration. The Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act establishes the eight bands as corporations recognized by the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement and establishes their powers in the following areas—making bylaws with respect to category IA lands under section 45; regulation of buildings for the protection of public safety; health and hygiene; public order and safety; the protection of the environment; the prevention of pollution; the taxation for local purposes of a broad range of local services; roads, traffic and transportation; the operation of businesses and the carrying on of trades; and parks and recreation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500195"> Other sections concern band financial administration, residence, access and other rights on category IA lands, the disposition of interests in these lands, and policing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500196"> Bill <Document DbId="3831702" Type="3">C-28</Document> provides amendments for each of these parties, thus giving considerable autonomy. Unfortunately, it is not yet complete, but it is the most progressive in Canada at the moment. I offer the example of an agreement signed not so long ago with a first nations band from my colleague's area, which was also granted autonomy. It was obtained through negotiation, consultation and agreements. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500197"> I was listening to the parliamentary secretary reminding us of Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document>. The government consulted some people, including women and the Assembly of First Nations. When this bill was introduced, we understood that the Assembly of First Nations acknowledged being consulted. The Native Women's Association of Canada, the Assembly of First Nations of Quebec and Labrador and Quebec Native Women also acknowledged being consulted. However, that is where the existing agreement between the department and these associations representing first nations stops. Consulting and taking nothing from the consultation contributes nothing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500198">This is why the first nations of Canada and of Quebec have spoken out against Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document>, as they did against C-44 and C-21, and as they will continue to do just as long as we do not recognize the philosophy and way of life, the culture and the needs of all first nations. When they ask for something in consultations, it is not enough just to listen but do nothing. Their needs must be taken into consideration. They are persons just as we are persons. Many more agreements can be reached, and I am proud of this for the James Bay Cree.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="128444" Type="2">Mr. Charlie Angus (Timmins—James Bay, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1500211">Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to speak today to this bill that recognizes the rights of the James Bay Cree of Quebec and would set in place a framework to move forward. It is one of those few occasions where we see all members of Parliament working together for a result that is needed and that can actually set a standard to move forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500212">I would like to begin this afternoon by placing this agreement in terms of the context so we have a real understanding of what it is we are talking about. As much as we support the bill and recognize the importance of the bill, we need to put it in terms of the overall failure of the federal government to put in place similar agreements elsewhere. We go back to the 1970s, the time when the James Bay projects were first being enacted in the province of Quebec. I think my colleagues from Quebec will agree that at that time the understanding of first nation relations was very different.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500213">When I worked in the region of Abitibi, I remember people talking about how the first nations were for many years considered squatters on their land. The idea of developing projects, whether it was hydroelectric projects, forestry projects or mining projects, they were never done in consultation with the first nation communities affected. In fact, this has been a situation that has gone on right across Canada. Even last year we saw the McGuinty government in Ontario jailing leaders of a first nation community who were trying to lay down some basic ground rules about consultations in their community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500214">The James Bay agreement stemmed out of what started as the James Bay Cree fighting to be recognized on their own territory and to say that if there were to be development, they would be at the table. If there were to be benefits, they wanted their people to see some of those benefits because they would be the ones living with the long term effects of the massive hydro developments being proposed at that time by the Bourassa government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500215">The James Bay agreement originally came into place because the province of Quebec recognized at a certain point that it would not be able to go ahead with development without a framework agreement in place with the James Bay Cree. There was too much international pressure. The Cree, Billy Diamond, Matthew Coon Comb, the whole leadership of that period, mounted such an amazing international fight that Quebec came to the table and, because Quebec came to the table, they said that the federal government had to come to the table as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500216">We do not see the federal government going out and settling land issues. It is not in the business of doing that. Time and time again, it dodges its obligations. It has refused to meet with first nations communities on the most basic issues. In terms of the initial James Bay agreement, it was because Quebec recognized that if it were to get hydroelectric development off the ground it would need to have an agreement and to have an agreement there needed to be a provincial and federal détente.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500217">The original James Bay agreement set the framework for the Cree of James Bay of Quebec to actually begin to participate in the 20th and 21st century economy and to set a standard in place that every first nation across this country has looked to. The idea of revenue sharing agreements used to be seen as revolutionary and now it is what first nations recognize is needed to go forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500218">I would like to compare the situation of the original James Bay Cree agreement, the Paix des Braves, with the bill we are looking at today, Bill <Document DbId="3831702" Type="3">C-28</Document>, in terms of the development of treaties on the ground and the success of the James Bay Cree, but compare it to the difficulties being faced by other first nation communities that are also trying to establish agreements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500219">I represent the James Bay region of Ontario and we could not see a starker contrast in terms of first nations development between the James Bay communities of Ontario and the James Bay communities of Quebec where both the federal government and provincial government in Ontario consistently walked away from basic obligations for infrastructure, education and health services that have left the communities in levels of poverty that most Canadians would not believe exist, but on the James Bay of Ontario it is all too often the daily occurrence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500220">I had the distinct pleasure in a past life to travel along the James Bay coast of Quebec where I saw proper roads, proper houses built and the people were part of the economy. This is not to underplay any of the problems that may exist on the James Bay coast of Quebec but to say that we have a very distinct situation in Ontario.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1500221">In my role as a member of Parliament, I took part in the Treaty 9 centenary that was happening across the great territory of the Nishnawbe Aski Nation, which is part of the region I represent. It has been 100 years since the signing of the treaty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500222">Being in communities such as Martin River, Fort Albany, Kashechewan and Moose Factory, I got a very different view of what those treaties meant than the politicians who were coming in to so-called celebrate it. In many of the communities I went to, people said there was not really much to celebrate in the fact that they signed off their land in good faith, to work as partners, to develop and to give their people a chance. The white commissioners at that time saw the treaties as a way of taking the land and putting the communities onto these pitiful reservations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500223">There is a difference in how the people talk about the treaties. It is clear that once the federal government signed the treaty, and in fact the province of Ontario signed Treaty 9 as well, as far as it was concerned it was finished with its obligations. It walked away on these communities. In the first nations communities, they still talk about what the treaties meant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500224">Let us look at the historical records of Treaty 9 communities, such as the Mushkego Cree of James Bay, Ontario. One of the reasons they signed the treaty was because they recognized that with the pressures on the change of life, with the Hudson's Bay factors who had lorded over the land for many years, there was a change coming. They were worried about the future of their children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500225">One of the key things they talked about in agreeing to sign that treaty was that they wanted their children educated. They would make the agreement to share their land, but they wanted their children to have proper schools. We know that the federal government never lived up to that obligation. In fact, it brought in a system of residential schools, not just on the James Bay coast but all across the territory, that inflicted massive generational wounds on these communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500226">Even to this day, in my region of Timmins--James Bay, we have two communities with no schools. There seems to be no plan for schools from the government. There seems to be no awareness by the government of a need to build schools. We see that the treaties that were signed were broken.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500227"> Having worked as a land negotiator with the Algonquin Nation, I learned very quickly that the word of the federal government often meant very little when it signed an agreement. It signed an agreement as long as the media lights were on and the ink was still wet on the page, but then when it left, whatever agreements a community may have had, the federal government said, “Take us to court”. Of course the communities are too poor to take it to court.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500228">I was working in the community of Barriere Lake after it signed an agreement with the federal government in 1998 to rebuild the community. I was there five or six years later and not a single new dwelling had been built, even though we had an agreement on paper, signed by the federal government, to work with the community to bring it out of its horrific levels of poverty in Barriere Lake.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500229">I sat in on a meeting in November 2005 with the minister of Indian affairs and all the top bureaucrats from Indian affairs to sign an agreement to build a new community for the crisis-ridden community of Kashechewan. I remember that when we were signing that agreement, it was vague, that the verbal agreements that we had been given by the minister and by the senior Indian affairs department heads were not on paper. They had made promises to work and rebuild the community, but none of the commitments we had in terms of moving to higher ground, of a timeline, of how many houses would be part of a movement to get that crisis-ridden community off a flood plain, were in the agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500230">We were told by the Indian affairs senior administration that it would be a sign of good faith and trust to just sign the agreement. Here we had a community that had been evacuated three times in one year because of a failure of infrastructure, because of the crisis that the community had been put through by the mismanagement of their land and their infrastructure by the federal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500231">The community was in a desperate situation and they signed that agreement, just as so many first nation communities have signed agreements over the years, in the best of faith. They believed that when the people sitting across the table from them, who represented the Crown, who represented the federal Government of Canada, said that they would follow through, they would mean it. The fact that everything was not spelled out in the agreement was not a problem because they told the community to its face that the agreement would be respected.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1500232">The results are clear. Less than a year later we had the government standing and saying there never was an agreement and there never was money set aside for the community of Kashechewan, there was no plan and this was all somehow a figment of people's imaginations and we misinterpreted what was said at the meeting even though we were there with the senior representatives, the senior civil servants of this country in terms of Indian affairs, and the minister and the senior political staff.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500233">We can see the frustration that exists in communities that take the federal government at its word when it comes to negotiating agreements. The failure of the government to live up to basic standards is evidenced for example going back to the community of Kashechewan. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500234">Just a year and a half ago we had two young men, Jamie Goodwin and Ricardo Wesley, who burned to death in a shack. That shack just happened to be a police station. It was a police station because there was no adequate police service facilities in the community of Kashechewan and there were no fire services in the community of Kashechewan. The Nishnawbe-Aski Police had been warning for years that unless the agreement that existed to fund first nation police services was addressed that someone would be hurt, someone would die, perhaps a citizen in a community where there was no police service, perhaps a police officer in an isolated community who had no backup.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500235">Unfortunately, in Kashechewan, it was the case of two young men who were not criminals. They were just young and rambunctious and they caught in a jail cell that should not have been used as a jail cell anywhere else in the western world, and they burned to death.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500236">I was in that jail before those men died. I was there with the Ontario minister of public safety and security and we showed him this building that looked like a crackshack in a war zone. We told him that this is what police officers are having to make do with and something should done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500237">We spoke in the House of Commons about the need to have agreements in place. It comes back to the issue of being at the table and signing agreements. In terms of police services, it is the federal government and the provincial government that sign these agreements with, for example, the Nishnawbe-Aski Police Services or with health services. Then, both the federal government and the provincial government walk away on those commitments, and the communities are left suffering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500238">The fire inquest has just finished in Ontario. The recommendations are damning. They are recommendations that we would have seen in any non-native community 40 or 50 years ago in terms of basic standards that have to be in place. For example, we need fire suppression, we need water sprinklers in any building, we need proper facilities, and we need proper funding for police services in these communities. The issue then becomes that agreements are signed but they are not signed in good faith, not by the federal government, very rarely. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500239">I would like to say in the case of Bill <Document DbId="3831702" Type="3">C-28</Document>, we have an agreement that works. I think we have that agreement because it was the Grand Council of the Crees who fought for so long and said, “This is our territory. When development happens on our territory, it will happen with our consent and unless they have our consent there will be no moving forward”. There was a very clear initial hard line. All the communities worked together to maintain that line. It brought the province of Quebec to the table and then brought the federal government to the table.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500240">I would like to think that it does not take a hard line to get other agreements in place. However, I wonder some days. I wonder when we see the recent report by the parliamentary budget officer and the shameful lack of standards for first nations schools. Again, we talk about agreements that are made and agreements that are broken, and they are casually broken.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500241">In the community of Attawapiskat, which was the impetus that drove the study to get Mr. Page to look at the funding, it is a community that has been poisoned for 30 years. It is a community where children have been at risk, children who now are starting to show signs of leukemia, having gone to school on the largest diesel contaminated site in North American history. That is where their school grounds are. They have been exposed on a daily basis to low levels of benzenes and methylethylenes, blowing up from the dust on the school grounds. That is a community that had negotiated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500242">Again, we are talking about a community that sat at the table and negotiated in good faith, that had done all the studies that were asked of them, that did all the reports that were asked of them, and that had signed commitments from regional Indian affairs bureaucrats in Thunder Bay, in Toronto, and all the way up to the minister's office, Robert Nault. He came to the community in July 2000 and committed that there will be a school there. Minister Andy Scott in November of 2005 sat with the senior bureaucrats and said, “Make this happen”. The former minister of Indian Affairs, who is a Conservative cabinet minister now, wrote a letter to the community and said, “I will support this plan at Treasury Board”.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1500243">If we were in business with someone who signed these kinds of agreements and then breached them, we would take them to court. We would have a reason and we would win in court. When someone makes those kinds of verbal and written commitments, works with a partner step by step along the way and then at the eleventh hour pulls out of negotiations, walks away and says there never was a deal, that person would be taken to court. Yet, first nations are left high and dry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500244">It is a question of the need to make a commitment to communities that is not arbitrary, erratic or based on whether ministers decide they are going to spend the money some place else. Maybe they are going to move it back to Treasury Board, maybe they are going to take money from a specific funding envelope for schools and spend it elsewhere. This is what the Parliamentary Budget Officer has shown us very clearly, that the standards at Indian Affairs are erratic, random and not measurable by any standard. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500245">As a former school board trustee, I was always shocked when I tried to get a straight answer out of Indian Affairs about its planning methodologies. It was making them up as it went along. Instead of having bureaucrats who could answer, I was dealing with spin doctors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500246">The civil service exists to protect the public interest and make sure that money taken from the taxpayers of Canada by the government is spent wisely. The role of the civil servant is not to cover the rear end of ministers based on whatever arbitrary political decision they make on a given day. Yet, this is what we see with Indian Affairs all the time. It raises the question of the federal government needing to take seriously on an across-Canada basis a willingness to negotiate in good faith and to tell first nations communities that it when it makes a plan, the plan will be transparent. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500247">There is kind of a sick joke for people who work in first nation communities where the federal government always says to any first nation, “You have to be accountable. You have to be transparent. We want to see your books. You can't monkey around with your numbers. You have to be able to show how you are spending that money”. Well, all first nation communities do that. If they do not, someone takes control of their finances immediately. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500248">Yet, Indian Affairs officials do not subject themselves to any of the same kinds of clear criteria, such as ring-fencing on line items so that funding envelopes cannot be pilfered and spent elsewhere. These are clear obligations. First nations cannot move that spending around. A school board cannot move the funding envelopes around. A municipality cannot go to the local school board and say, “We are not building schools for you this year because we are going to build some roads with it and give a tax cut to our constituents because it is an election year”. That cannot happen. That would be illegal under the provincial systems of government and, of course, it should be. Yet, at the federal level, that is the way business is done on first nations territory.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500249">We are looking at an agreement that should be a model, an agreement that was made with a number of communities in the James Bay region of Quebec that drew a line in the sand and said, “There will be a standard of how you work with us, how you consult with us, how you develop our territory, and we will be part of that”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500250">I am very proud to work with all the parties in the House to make sure this bill gets through and that this agreement comes into force. However, the standard of trust and respect has to become part of the federal government mantra in order to develop all our first nation communities because the greatest resource we have in our lands and the territory north of 50 is not forestry, not hydro, not the gold nor the diamonds. It is the young people and the children living on reserves who are often treated as completely neglected backwater. The failure of the government to plan and work with communities to develop the resource of these children, these young people, and these growing communities is a staggering loss for today, for tomorrow, and for what our country could become.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1500255">Mr. Speaker, with regard to the report brought out by Kevin Page, he does not address the massive shortfalls in salaries paid to teachers, or the lack of special education dollars, or the lack of adequate resources. He simply talks about managing the assets, the infrastructure of schools.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500256">What is very positive about Mr. Page's report is that he offers us a way of working together. He is saying that we need to move toward a capital planning methodology, which exists everywhere with regard to school boards, whether in a school board of just 13 isolated rural schools or in larger cities. Our capital planning methodology would be the same as it was in the city of Toronto, where there are hundreds of schools. The methodology has to be that we take a long-term view, that we understand the conditions of the buildings, which Indian Affairs does not have, that we have a clear standard in terms of what we expect and that we have clear financing in place to maintain and replace these schools. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500257">From Mr. Page's report we see that every year the government under funds school construction and maintenance by about $170 million. Therefore, these buildings are already substandard. Then there is the lack of support from that. Of the money that is in place, the government moves it to spend on other things. In the last five years, $122 million that should have gone directly to building schools was spent on other projects. We cannot do that if we are to protect the education rights of children.</ParaText>

The building has been abandoned for 30 years. The government's solution in Attawapiskat was to tear the building down. There is no other jurisdiction I know of that would tear down a building as a school solution. When the government tore that building down, it promised the community it would have medical teams on hand because it knew the risks to those children. Therefore, community agreed to having it torn down. We do not make a promise of medical teams for demolition unless we know how serious it is. Guess what? There were no medical teams present. Health Canada told the community to send their kids back to school in the middle of the demolition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500264">We have documented reports of teachers getting sick, children throwing up. We had a teaching crew from the Toronto school board at the time, and the teachers were horrified. Kids had nosebleeds and some passed out in the classrooms. Anywhere else there would be an outcry that would lead to people being charged, people being fired and heads would roll. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500265"> We have heard the minister say that he is not aware of any health and safety problems whatsoever and he has told us to prove it. We are talking about children who have been left at risk. A promise was made to have medical teams available to ensure the children would not get sick. Again, it is the lack of good faith from the government. It makes agreements and it walks away, leaving children at risk. That is simply unacceptable in a country like Canada in the 21st century.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1500266">Mr. Speaker, although the bill is not controversial and should get the support of the House at third reading, the subject matter seems to have drifted to the obligations of the Government of Canada with regard to first nation issues.</ParaText>

In fact, I refer to statements about the fact that the Supreme Court of Canada recognized the federal government was required to consult, accommodate and obtain first nations' consent when it contemplated action that could affect first nation, aboriginal or treaty rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500268">Even some of the questions that we have seen at question period, again, seem to deny the fact that there was no consultation in the form that was required, that informed consent was not there, that the accommodation was not there.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1500270">Mr. Speaker, the obligation to consult has been defined in court decision after court decision. It is the obligation of the federal government to work with first nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500271">Again, if we are going to move forward, it is the prerequisite for developing legislation, where we start to move away from treating first nations as somehow children or wards of the state who can be treated in an arbitrary fashion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500272">Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document> looks to address some of the existing issues on how first nation laws are enacted. However, clearly we did not see a pattern of consultation. The government needs to understand that until it does consultations, until it works collaboratively, first, with the first nations and then with its partners in the House of Commons, it will be unable to force legislation through. It will also be unable to attack its opponents and say that we are against human rights and so on. The government can do it all it wants, but it will not get the legislation it needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500273"> I hope the minister would learn from this and reflect on it. Why waste the time of Parliament and why waste the time of Canadians? If he does not do the groundwork and consult, the bills will eventually fail. It is the obligation of members of the opposition to push back in those cases because without consultation, there is no legitimacy for developing first nation law.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1500278">Mr. Speaker, I am not going to use my whole time slot because there is cooperation on the bill. I want to use my time as a springboard to talk about some of the items the previous member talked about and to get points on the record about land claims implementation and improving or amending land claims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500279">There are two types of land claims. There are comprehensive claims that deal with everything. It is a complete treaty that deals with the entire land, resources, and sometimes self-governance agreements that are attached. That is called a comprehensive claim.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500280">Then there is a specific claim. If there is a treaty in place but the treaty has not been followed specifically, there is a claim that an item in the treaty has not been followed and there is a grievance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500281">Regarding specific claims, which I will deal with first because they are the easiest, the government brought forward a good initiative, which all parties agreed with, to get specific claims into a tribunal and get them out of the old system. Basically two adversaries made a claim that something was done or not done. The judge, in essence, was one of those parties, and obviously that did not make any sense. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500282">The new system for specific claims is very good. It has an independent arbiter get arguments from the two parties and then make a decision. That is a very good improvement, and it's a big step forward. It deals with thousands of those little specific annoyances. Many of the claims are small, but some of them have been backlogged for years and years. All parties agree that this should speed it up and deal with the problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500283">With regard to the comprehensive claims, which are in lineups for years and years, a number of them are under negotiation. Once again, we have to make sure there is a fair system to deal with them that does not have them lost in the other business of the department, that there are enough resources that people are not waiting another generation to have their land claim and self-governance dealt with, that it is done in a fair manner and that there is some type of independent arbiter who actually makes the ultimate decision. Hopefully, we can move forward in that respect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500284">The last area is when there is a treaty, especially a modern treaty, and how we deal with the provisions to implement that. Having a land claim and a self-government agreement is not really the end of the road, as some people might think. It is actually the beginning of a great journey of governments together: the Canadian government; first nations governments; all aboriginal governments, Inuit and Métis. It is a starting point for a new government-to-government relationship. It is a living type of relationship; it is not set in stone. It has to evolve and unfold in good faith and in the spirit those agreements were signed so they can work and progress.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500285"> It does not matter how much legalese there is, nothing will work if the will is not there to make it work. To make it work changes have to be made, with modifications and provision of the resources and the good will to make them work. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500286">In regard to some of the modern treaties that have been signed, there are a number of problems. The Auditor General has pointed them out. It is so significant that the first nations with modern treaties, many of them north of 60, have formed a land claims coalition, because their grievances are falling between the cracks. People think an agreement is signed and that is the end of it. Organizations and governments have other things on their plate and they forget that with these modern treaties the implementation process is not smooth, it is not financed, it is not finished. There is a lot of evolving to do and a lot of work to be done on the implementation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1500287">It is pretty bad when so many hundreds of first nations people have to have an organization and conferences to try to bring their points and grievances to us. They need to be dealt with in good faith.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500288"> The funding amounts for these claims are not necessarily known on the first day the claim is signed. As an example, the negotiators in the Yukon claims, very wisely, put in a nine-year review period. They will go back after nine years and see that the money being transferred under the program services transfer agreements to each first nations government to run a program that was formerly run by the federal government is enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500289">It was very wise that there would be a nine-year review. Unfortunately, just to use this as an example, we are now in the thirteenth year of the nine-year review. It should not take that long. They have done baseline studies, with both governments having officials involved, to study the gross expenditure base and exactly how much it takes to run those programs. It is time to get to the table to get those amounts resolved. As the member has said, the federal government has to provide a negotiator who will negotiate in good faith. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500290">The point made to us is that over these many years, more years than it took to fight the first world war, the negotiators have constantly changed on the federal side and they came without a mandate from cabinet. These things are not going to make for progress.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500291">Hopefully government officials have received that message over the last few weeks from the coalition and from our committee hearings, where we have dealt with this to some extent. I compliment the committee for bringing that topic up. I forget which member actually brought it up, but I commend that member for bringing it to all the members' attention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500292">Another example is that these particular modern agreements allow a first nations government to take on certain powers. That makes eminent sense. We have some great success stories of first nations delivering their own programs. Unfortunately, they seem to be endlessly roadblocked in taking on the powers that have been legislatively assigned to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500293">We have one first nation that has been working on a particular power, and I do not want to point any fingers, for nine years now. The two world wars basically could have been fought in that time. That is to take on a simple power that is legislatively their right. Nothing should take that long. Maybe people have problems with the agreements, but we should have thought of that when we signed the agreements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500294">The agreements are laws. In fact they are stronger than the ordinary laws of the land, because they are constitutionally protected. The land claims, and in some cases the self-government agreements, are constitutionally protected, although not the Yukon agreements. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500295">We have signed these agreements in good faith with the honour of the Crown. We should be implementing them in good faith. We should sit down, provide negotiators, hopefully with consistency, and with enough mandate and resources to come to an agreement so that first nations can take on these programs. I think we would all be pleasantly surprised, and we would benefit from the success stories that would evolve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500296">Some of these things in our history have not gone well. These new models obviously cannot be worse, and they could be great success stories for the country. There could actually be resource savings, for a lot of reasons I will not get into. Obviously it would save of a lot of human failure and lack of success stories. We would have new models that might work in those communities, if we simply put some spirit, some effort and some resources into the implementation of these claims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500297">I have had one member from my community suggest that we set up an independent commission, like the specific claims commission, to deal with some of these implementation problems, as opposed to having these negotiations go on forever. In fact it is funny that there would be a negotiation over something that is a right by law. Why do we not just have an independent decision and get on with it so these agreements can continue?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1500298">The bill we are talking about today is a good example of making a correction, but of course it took far too long. I know there are more grievances. A number of times in committee some administrative corrections were requested. I compliment the federal government. It seems to have committed that within a year the other details will be taken care of. We did not want to move forward until we got the assurance from the department that these other administrative improvements that need to be made in this area are going to be made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500299">The last point I want to make is that sometimes various departments of the federal government do not seem to be aware that when there is a relationship with another government of equal stature in certain areas, it is not just the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. These agreements are signed by Canada and a first nation. All the departments within the first nation have to abide by these agreements, but so do all the departments in the federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500300">If there is a responsibility to consult, as the last member spoke very eloquently about, it is not just the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development; it is the Government of Canada and all the departments. The Government of Canada has 50 or 60 departments and agencies. It is not only the department that can do things that could affect the rights of first nations, Inuit or Métis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500301"> And just as a sideline, I hope the minister will give attention to the Yukon Métis association that met on the weekend and is looking for funding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500302">It is not just the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development that has to respect the responsibility to consult, because any other department or agency could do something that would impinge on the rights of aboriginal people. They have to be very aware that these modern treaties, which include a government-to-government relationship and a duty to consult, apply to all federal departments and agencies. I hope the officials who are listening from other departments will remember this and get up to speed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500303">It is a very complicated task, because there are a variety of agreements across the country that are all different. That is a benefit, because individuals and communities are different, but it also makes it complicated for administrators to know the responsibilities of the federal government and to deal in the honour of the Crown with each individual government and community. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500304">It is a big task, but the progress being made in this bill is an example that the job can be done if everyone works together. For that reason I will be supporting this, and I will be looking for progress. Hopefully we will continue, as we do with specific claims in areas that still need to be dealt with, on comprehensive claims and the implementation of modern treaties.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1500305">Mr. Speaker, I have a question for my hon. colleague, who has done a tremendous amount of work with first nations communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500306">The Senate is doing a review of the Indian Act in Manitoba and other parts of Canada right now. It is going to first nations communities and asking the question of whether the Indian Act impedes their ability to build their communities to become economically self-sufficient and viable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500307">My personal view is that the Indian Act should be scrapped and that consultations should take place with first nations communities to determine how a structure can take place in order to create a relationship that is going to be mutually beneficial and productive. Certainly the status quo actually hamstrings the ability of first nations communities to develop.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500308">I know that with first nations in my riding of Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, chiefs and councils have a terrible time with development.

              <ParaText id="1500310">Mr. Speaker, that is a very interesting question about whether the Indian Act should stay or not. I will give two answers to it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500311"> First, last week we had an interesting speaker in the parliamentary restaurant, a professor from the University of Ottawa, and I asked her specifically about the Indian Act. She said that there were a lot of bad things in it but that there also were a lot of dependencies, that it was a government department that actually came through with certain items for first nations and that it was their contact in government. She had sort of a mixed view. The point is that it would be a very complex task but it should be looked at.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500312">The second answer relates to the land claims that we have had in Yukon. Once one has been through a modern treaty, a land claim and a self-government agreement, the Indian Act no longer applies. My personal opinion is that the evidence of that is like night and day as to the results of the success stories. I used to go around to these first nations bands and find a cabin, may or may not find a shack and may or may not find a band administrator and that was about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500313">Now that those bands have self-government agreements and land claims, they have modernized buildings, a modernized bureaucracy and they are delivering their own programs. All governments are receiving less complaints about the programs because they are being delivered right there in their villages. Many of their people are no longer unemployed because they are the bureaucrats delivering the programs to their own people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500314">It is a long road but it is like night and day and a great success story, which is the reason I say we should get on with comprehensive claims with all the first nations that would like to do it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1500316">In Manitoba, we just held a day of healing and reconciliation this past Saturday where a clear message was sent to me and others that this place needs to offer more than an apology to the aboriginal people of Canada for the trauma of the residential school experience, and that we really need to be acting very specifically and concretely on initiatives that will deal with the hurt and the systemic inequalities that now exist in the first nations, aboriginal and Métis communities.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1500318">Mr. Speaker, the member made the excellent point that the apology was not really the end. It is like signing a land claim; it is actually the beginning. It is the beginning of recognition by every member of Parliament that there was a grievous mistake and grievous ramifications and effects not only to generation that went through it but to their progeny.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500319">If we recognized that problem in the great ceremony we had here, then we also need to recognize that we need to deal with that problem. For instance, we cannot allow the healing fund to expire as if everyone is healed just because the apology was made. We cannot allow the reconciliation process, when it gets started, to be a sounding board and not have any action. The purpose of the reconciliation hearings will be to give us an idea of not only the effect it has had on people but what their ideas are of what we can do to mitigate those effects and help them get on with life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500320">The member certainly would have been moved by the ceremony we had in my riding a couple of weeks ago where they tore down an old residential school. What moved me was that virtually all the speakers talked about their chance for a new beginning, that, as the member said, if we give them the tools and the resources then they can leave the hurt in the past. It will never be gone but they can now get on with a new life. They are looking forward a new bright future, like all Canadians should have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500321">If we put that commitment into it, I think all of our citizens will move ahead to the benefit of all of us.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1500323">My question for the member has to do with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. My understanding is that Canada is not a signatory. This came up in our discussions on Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document> on matrimonial real property. The declaration includes such items as the rights of indigenous peoples to self-determination; to maintain and strengthen their distinct political, legal, economic, social and cultural institutions; to not be subjected to forced assimilation or destruction of their culture; and, without discrimination, to the improvement of their economic and social conditions. The list goes on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500324">Those, to me, seem to be values that Canada should embrace and they should be reflective in legislation that we bring before this place as it relates to our first nations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500325">Does the member know why Canada is not a signatory to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and does he know whether or not the bill before us now, at least in spirit, reflects the principles underlying that declaration?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1500326">Mr. Speaker, the member makes a very good point. I will not speculate on the technical reasons that the government has not signed it, but he talked about the values that are there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500327">As I said earlier in my response to the member for <Affiliation DbId="128753" Type="2">Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca</Affiliation>, if one follows those values that occur in the self-government and land claims agreements in the modern treaties, such as the social values and the ability of first nations, maybe there is another answer. Maybe they have ways of running their own local justice system, as they have successfully for thousands of years. Maybe they have a different way of self-determination. Maybe they have different matrimonial property rights. Maybe they have a different way of looking at governance, where everything is not the individual, but one has collective rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500328">One of their biggest arguments against Bill <Document DbId="3635116" Type="3">C-8</Document> as it is written is that it does not recognize collective rights as a way of governing another people. The United Nations declaration points out all these points. As the member for <Affiliation DbId="128753" Type="2">Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca</Affiliation> said, our pilot projects in Canada in the modern treaties that got certain first nations away from the Indian Act have been very successful.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1500336">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to continue this discourse that was interrupted some weeks ago before the House rose.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500337">I want to remind the folks in the House and at home that we are dealing with Bill <Document DbId="3758926" Type="3">C-20</Document>, the Nuclear Liability and Compensation Act. This is an attempt to reform a very old piece of legislation that has been sitting on the government's books for a number of years. It does require some modernization but the government has gone about it in such a way as to leave very few, outside of the very narrow band of the industry, satisfied, and has allowed no real sense of security or knowledge that communities will be properly compensated in the event of a nuclear accident.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500338">The bill would limit the liability that a nuclear provider will be exposed to in the event of a nuclear accident to $650 million. On a number of fronts this raises concerns for New Democrats and for Canadians across the country, whether they live in a community that has a nuclear reactor in it, adjacent to a community or just on the broad principle of how this country goes about dealing with the very sensitive and controversial issue of nuclear energy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500339">This is all happening within the context that is not exactly ideal for the nuclear industry. We hear in the House, day after day, questions put to the <Affiliation DbId="128708" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> about Chalk River, which is a nuclear facility here in Canada owned by the government that seems to go through problems every 18 months or so, in which it leaks, contaminates and then shuts down. In the shutting down, this facility provides isotopes that are used in diagnostic testing for cancer patients and provides 80% of the Canadian supply and more than 50% of the world supply, throwing the world into all sorts of concern that Canada is becoming an increasingly unreliable partner in this field.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500340">It also falls into the context of Ontario putting many billions of dollars forward foreseeing that it is running out of viable energy supplies and deciding not to put the economy on a green track but deciding to invest in nuclear instead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500341">Obviously the CANDU reactor, the AECL is one of those bidders, as is the French and some other interests. This is an extraordinarily important file for the government, obviously, because it seems to want to sell AECL, a Canadian subsidized company, an arm's length crown corporation into which the Canadian taxpayer has put more than $20 billion over time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500342">No other energy sector outside of the oil and gas sector has received the kind of subsidies and special treatment that the nuclear industry has, and that is continued under Bill <Document DbId="3758926" Type="3">C-20</Document>. We do not offer limited liability to other sectors in the Canadian economy. We do not say to the auto sector, the manufacturing sector or the resort and tourism sector that the Government of Canada will backstop major accidents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500343">To understand why we feel that the bill falls short at $650 million, one has only to go back to when there have been nuclear accidents and look at the costs to clean it up and the costs to compensate people. What do other countries do when they are faced with the question of liability? There is a variance of degrees in ways that this industry is treated but we cannot find any cases where the limited liability is set at such a small amount. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500344">For example, all nuclear providers in the U.S. contribute to a common pool that approaches upward of $10 billion in the event of a nuclear accident; that is $10 billion to $650 million. It does not matter when we are taking the size and scale in terms of our country being smaller than the U.S. because a nuclear accident is a nuclear accident and a community affected is a community affected. We can take the case of Japan and Germany which are advocating and putting in position unlimited liability. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500345">One needs to ask how viable this technology and industry is if it requires not only $20 billion in government subsidies and subsidies every year, because we just kicked in another few hundred million dollars, but it also requires the government to backstop the liability of the industry. The risks are so great, as acknowledged by the government, that the taxpayer will either be backstopping any large insurance claims or it will just prevent Canadians from suing the government beyond a certain amount.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500346">One needs to wonder how the government comes to the point of saying that if, in the event of a nuclear accident of some scale in Pickering or in any of the other communities associated with these nuclear facilities are seriously harmed or destroyed, that it will set a figure as to how much they can be compensated for the loss of life, industry, home, community, and then we need to imagine that over time.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1500347">How would $650 million compensate a community with nuclear toxicity in its soil and water? We know the half-life of some isotopes could be many thousands of years, and taking that over time means hundreds of thousands of years of contamination. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500348">This is the challenge with nuclear that has been described as the saving grace under the carbon constrained economies that we are looking at right now. The liability component is serious and significant and it has to be curtailed by government. The special treatment that is afforded to nuclear is not afforded to other industries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500349">The government often talks about not wanting to pick winners and losers, about letting the invisible hand of the marketplace dictate what will or will not happen, but then we see bills like Bill <Document DbId="3758926" Type="3">C-20</Document>. This is not an Adam Smith bill in design or designation. This is not a free market, free capital principled bill. This legislation would have us enter the marketplace, decide, and then tip the scales one way or the other. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500350">That is the debate required here. That is what the government must defend in bringing the bill forward. The Liberals support the bill overwhelmingly, but I am not sure if any of the Liberal members will stand up with conviction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500351">Many representatives of the nuclear industry appeared before committee when the Chalk River spill and contamination occurred. Canadians heard that there was no leak at Chalk River and that contamination was contained. These words are used in common parlance as meaning to contain something or to withhold it. What in fact happens is that nuclear radiation leaks out of the facility, is held in a pool for a certain amount of time and then released into the Ottawa River. The nuclear industry defines that as containment. A leak is not a leak if it goes into the air. That is something else entirely. Another word is used for that. The government said there was no leak and anything that did happen was contained.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500352">We have all heard in Parliament and in committee folks using words that in common usage mean one thing, but in a specific application mean something entirely different. People are led astray.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500353">The nuclear industry is very nervous because at this moment it is trying to sell a bunch of Candu reactors. It is trying to sell them to Ontario, then maybe to other countries, and then maybe sell off all of AECL. Moving the limited liability act through the House is critical to the government's hope of eventually selling off this public asset.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500354">If we are talking about competitiveness for the nuclear industry, then for heaven's sake, one would imagine the government would look to our competitors, primarily Europe, Japan and the United States, to find out what they are doing for their industries. What kind of compensation regime have they set up? What kind of limited liability have they set up to allow the Canadian product to compete fairly? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500355">From all of our reading of this, and we have yet to see it corrected by the government or anybody else, that has yet to be proven. That is not what our competitors use. Our competitors allow for something that would seek a bit more compensation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500356"> Even undercutting that entire argument, what is proper compensation after a nuclear accident? The industry said the Three Mile Island incident did not typify a major accident in the sense that it did not go through a full nuclear meltdown. The cost in those days was just shy of $1 billion. This legislation limits liability to $650 million. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500357">The Chernobyl accident stands alone in its own rarefied air of when something really goes wrong. The compensation amounts that would be required if a Chernobyl incident happened obviously would exceed anything close to the limited liability act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500358">As Ontario muses as to whether it will go with the Candu system or the European or some other model, the liability question stands front and centre. This is all meshed into one. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1500359">There are the incidents at Chalk River where we have a reactor that is 50-some years old. It leaks from time to time. It contaminates the Ottawa River from time to time. It leaks out the smoke stacks and out the pipe itself. They call them pinhole pricks, but I suppose it does not take much in terms of a nuclear leak to really matter. It throws into question the whole nature, orientation and management of the nuclear industry by the current government and previous governments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500360">One has to take this all into consideration with the other choices that are available when it comes to producing energy. We have seen the government apply the blinkers when it comes to the tar sands, continuing a $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion tax subsidy into northern Alberta every year, whether or not the market is roaring hot, too hot according to the people who live there, subsidizing an industry that did not need subsidizing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500361">The government has shown itself to be incapable of properly measuring its own greenhouse gas emissions. It challenges every bill the opposition puts forth. The NDP has proposed a bill for the next round of climate change commitments in Copenhagen and the government's number one criticism has been, “We are not sure that you can properly account for things here, here and here”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500362">The Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development, the auditor of all things environmental came before committee this morning and confirmed to government and opposition members who were there that the government has no capacity to measure its own greenhouse gas numbers and the effectiveness of any of the programs that it runs. Yet the government feels completely comfortable in taking credit for all sorts of reductions it is going to have in the future when it cannot actually measure what it has already done. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500363">The whole thing is thrown into suspicion, and into this walks so much certainty from the government with respect to nuclear. Is nuclear part of the debate? Absolutely. Should it be put on the table with the alternatives? Absolutely. But the government is not creating a level playing field. We have seen that with the recent budget that came from the government when we compare it to what came out of Washington. In terms of the alternative resources, in terms of the alternative generation of energy, it is the game. Everyone who has studied this, everyone who has looked at economic recoveries around the world knows that energy has been and will be the central question for economies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500364">The government is spending on a ratio of one to fourteen per capita to the Americans right now. On the alternative energies--we are not talking nuclear or the fictitious carbon capture and sequestration the government keeps pandering and no one is listening to and certainly no one in industry is interested in investing in--but the true alternatives, the solar, the wind, the tidal and run a river on those fronts that have an extremely high job creation potential, the government is doing one-fourteenth on a per person basis compared to our American counterparts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500365">What happens to an industry, especially a nascent industry, when it is looking to locate itself on one side of a border or another? Industry representatives from wind, from solar, from tidal, from all of these groups, Canadian firms, have come to us time and time again to say that they are leaving. They want to operate here and they want to create the jobs here, but the investment climate is terrible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500366">Take wind for example. The government has a program that was meant to run out in year 2011. It was successful. The provinces actually filled in the void and they subscribed to it. This is a program that started a number of years ago. The government should realize there is success to be had in creating wind energy in Canada and perhaps even manufacturing in Canada. It could be helping out those communities such as the one we visited in Welland the other day, where a former auto parts plant is now making components for the wind industry. The government should be magnifying that, making that greater. It should have a vision that Canadians can get excited about and enthralled with. Rather than realizing that, still we see a government tinkering at the edges, putting up fictitious ideas that no one supports. It has yet to present a credible environmental plan that anyone, right wing, left wing, environmental, industry will validate. Not one has said that the numbers the government pretends to have in dealing with climate change can be validated. That was confirmed again by the auditor.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500367">This liability act raises many questions for Canadians who are faced with concerns around nuclear liability and they are given no assurances. They are told that we will have a limited liability and nothing else.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500368">Government members time and time again remain silent on this. Members of the official opposition, the Liberals, seem to give this a wink and a nod and off it goes. It feels more and more like an inside job. It feels like a job where Canadians are not allowed to participate in the conversation, saying that if we are going to support this industry for another $20 billion and another 50 years at cost overruns, leaks and melts and all the rest of that, then for heaven's sake there will be something that will allow--</ParaText>

I am hoping that as a fellow northerner, quasi-northerner, he would support the effort that because wind energy in the north is a lot more expensive as it is a harsher climate and there is rime icing, the incentive for wind energy has to be even higher in the north so we can take advantage of it and get it going.

It is one of the reasons we requested an emergency debate yesterday, so that the government could come forward and say what the actual numbers are and what it is doing to fill in the gaps in terms of people who are in cancer treatment or will be in the next number of months.

              <ParaText id="1500382">Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question. The situation in the United States is different because there are many more companies. However, the pooling of $10 billion, as in the United States, might be enough to cover the cost of a nuclear accident. The question is not how much the companies are willing to pay but what would be the compensation in the event of an accident.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500383">The liability established in the United States, Europe and Japan is not the same as that provided for in the bill. Who are we trying to delude by saying that the level of compensation is lower in Canada? The Government of Canada wants to show that this is an opportunity for nuclear companies. That is ridiculous. The situation in the United States is different. At the same time, this bill cannot set a liability of $10 billion. It is not possible for us to do the same thing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1500387">That is the issue for local people, the only one. In the event of a nuclear accident, there is an overall liability limit. That is not an amount just for individuals and another for the municipalities or industries affected. That is an overall amount, for one and all families in the event of an accident. With this bill, the possibility of a nuclear accident has to be considered. We cannot have this debate without taking that into account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500388">Regarding the limit, the government says it is high enough. I think not. The problem the Liberals are having in committees now is that they cannot get amounts changed. Should the House approve this bill at this stage, it would then be impossible to amend it with respect to compensation amounts and limits. We have a problem with that. I assume and hope that the Liberals, Bloc members and all the other members also have a problem with that. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1500391">Mr. Speaker, that is the point about the low limit set by the bill in order to attract the investment. Other jurisdictions such as the United States, Japan, Europe, which have viable nuclear industries, much bigger than ours, have set much higher limits. The fact that we have to set such a low and artificial limit for this industry alone should be of concern to Canadians. We do not do that for any other industry</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500392"> The fact is if an accident were to happen at a nuclear facility, as has been shown in any other accident that happened in the past, the costs are enormous. The true cost of operating nuclear facilities is not simply the cost overruns on the production; it is the eventual and incurred cost of risk that is sitting in that facility. If things go wrong, it gets expensive quickly, not only in terms of dollars but also of human life and suffering.</ParaText>

A number of years ago we built nuclear energy facilities in Ontario at a cost that grew exponentially over time. Ultimately they had to be dealt with by the provincial government.

              <ParaText id="1500397">Second, if there were an accident, I would assume that this place would be taken up with the compensation. That factor has to put into the price right up front.

              <ParaText id="1500398">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in debate on Bill <Document DbId="3758926" Type="3">C-20</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500399">Let me begin by talking about the highlights of Bill <Document DbId="3758926" Type="3">C-20</Document> on nuclear liability. Like much of what the government does, there is not much new here. Bill C-20 is a culmination of discussions that begun under the previous Liberal government. In fact, it replaces the 1976 Nuclear Liability Act. It establishes a clear regime in the event of a nuclear accident. Thank goodness there has never been one in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500400">The key element of the bill is to increase operator liability from $75 million to $650 million. It is important that my hon. colleagues from the NDP keep that in mind, that the bill is about increasing the liability limit not decreasing it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500401">This is in response to recommendations from the Senate Committee on Energy, the Environment and Natural Resources. It is interesting to see the government taking its lead from the Senate, which it was so busy stacking just a few months ago. Obviously their overzealous rhetoric about the other chamber is more for show than anything else.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500402">As I have stated, there is not a lot new in this bill. In fact, the same bill was introduced in the last Parliament, and probably would have been on the books by now if not for the fact that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> broke his own fixed date election law last fall and called an election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500403">In the last Parliament, the natural resources committee conducted a comprehensive study of the bill, as it then was, and some amendments were considered, including the possibility of raising the liability limit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500404">I look forward to hearing from expert witnesses when the bill goes back to committee, as I think it will. I certainly will support having it do that. I am looking forward to hearing ways it may be possible to improve the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500405">One issue that ought to be addressed would be a possible amendment that would allow for the industry to look for insurance outside of Canada if it would be a problem to be limited. It is important that we at least hear the arguments on that. It is certainly an issue that has been raised by representatives of the industry. Clearly we would prefer that they shop in Canada for things like this, but let us hear what they have to say about the argument for broadening that if there is some limitation or lack of competition for this kind of liability insurance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500406">We know there are some kinds of insurance that very few insurers will offer. We think of a group like Lloyd's of London as being famous for insuring things that nobody else will. If there is only one insurer in the country that will insure what the industry does, it may be stuck with that price. We have to at least hear what the industry has to say about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500407">Other than that, it does not seem to be a particularly controversial bill. As we read through the bill, a few questions come to mind. We could ask why the operators liability should be limited to $650 million, which is a tremendous increase from what it has been. The answer is that if it were higher than that, they would be unable to get liability insurance. It is not available, as I understand it, for amounts higher than that, therefore no new plants will be built. That is an important consideration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500408">Another question is, are there to be no qualifications for appointment to the tribunal that is set up in the legislation? This is something we ought to consider at committee, considering the views of expert witnesses on what kinds of qualifications the members of the tribunal ought to have and what kind of people we are looking for on the tribunal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500409">Overall the bill is a good example of civil servants doing their work well, as it probably emanates from them. I thank them for their work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500410"> However, one thing that already concerns me with Bill <Document DbId="3758926" Type="3">C-20</Document> is the role of the minister in reviewing the liability amount every five years. My concern on this question of the review of liability stems from the lack of a coherent nuclear energy policy coming from the government. How will the government deal with this liability issue when it does not seem to be able to competently manage this file in its entirety? I have concerns, as many members do on this side—</ParaText>

That is a basic right for all Canadians, regardless of whether they live in Quebec or in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="128381" Type="2">Moncton—Riverview—Dieppe</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500429"> Like many other francophones in Canada, the Acadians in my riding are not all bilingual by any means. They find it hard to express themselves and understand various expressions in English. We speak English or French depending on how we learned our mother tongue. I learned French on the rinks and in the schools of New Brunswick, and I married an Acadian woman. It is the language I support here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500430"> The Supreme Court justices should be able to understand and speak French. Canada is a bilingual country and who better to set an example than the judges of the highest court in the land? I think that all members of Parliament should understand the importance of this bill and support it. Canada is a country that was built by the French and English. We should ensure, therefore, that everyone is served in the language of his or her choice, especially before the Supreme Court. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500431"> There are laws in this country guaranteeing linguistic rights. The first is section 16(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which says that “English and French are the official languages of Canada and have equality of status and equal rights and privileges...”. It is a matter of equality. This was not the situation in 1986 when the Supreme Court heard the case of the Société des Acadiens v. Association of Parents for Fairness in Education, and when the Supreme Court wrote that there was no equality right for French in this country. That was corrected, however, in the Supreme Court’s Beaulac decision. In addition, section 18 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms says “...both language versions [French and English] are equally authoritative”. This means there is equality under Canadian law.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1500432">In English, the Official Languages Act says that any journal, record, act of Parliament, et cetera, shall be made, enacted, printed, published and tabled simultaneously in both languages, and most importantly, both language versions are equally authoritative. This is the law of the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500433">In the case of Société des Acadiens v. Association of Parents, it was not accepted that an accused had a right to translation when being presented with a criminal charge. As I mentioned, this was corrected by the decision in Beaulac, a 1999 Supreme Court decision, under the pen of then Mr. Justice Bastarache. It was decided to completely reject the law in the case of the Société des Acadiens and say that, “To the extent that Société des Acadiens stands for a restrictive interpretation of language rights, it is to be rejected”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500434">That has been the law of the country with respect to accused persons since 1999. There were two judges in that decision, the late Antonio Lamer and the current sitting member, Justice Binnie, who disagreed with the decision, but on the grounds that a criminal case should not be purported or extended to make constitutional law. Whether or not we agree with those justices is a matter of debate here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500435">That is the first and best reason why we should follow this bill. There is another reason though and it is the best evidence rule. This is a common law-created rule which suggests that from the 18th century forward, the best evidence is to be used. What does that mean? It means that the best the nature of the case will allow is the quote from the 1745 decision of the English courts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500436">What better evidence can there be before a judge of the highest appellate court in this country, who wants to interpret what is being said, other than to understand exactly what is being said? It goes to the very nature of advocacy before our highest court.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500437">In a bit of a segue, we are talking about all nine judges of the Supreme Court being able to understand, not necessarily speak but understand, both languages. Imagine that if there were judges who came from the province of Quebec or parts of New Brunswick where there are only unilingual French-speaking candidates, imagine the shoe on the other foot, so to speak. If an English litigant hired the best lawyer he could find in Ottawa to make an argument at the appellate level on a very important case to that litigant, and the judges were divided four-four and it came down to one judge who could not understand English, there would be an outcry. The English litigant would say, “He is not listening to my argument. He is listening to the interpreter”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500438">We all admire our interpretation people in this Parliament and across the courts. It is a wonderful instrument, but the very nature of interpretation means that they are taking words and forming them in their own artistic belief as to what the speaker intends. That may work in solemnizing marriages. It may work in giving out change in an arcade, but it does not work at the highest level of advocacy in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500439">The advocates who are before the Supreme Court of Canada will tell us that 90% of the cases that are decided by the court are decided when a judge of the court asks them a question, and their response wins or loses the case for them. If that answer has to go through an artistic interpretation of what the advocate meant, justice is not being done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500440">There is an argument that maybe the best qualified individuals will not be chosen. That is like saying that eight of our nine Supreme Court justices right now are not the highest qualified judges in the country. I think they are.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1500445">Mr. Speaker, I would first like to congratulate the member for <Affiliation DbId="128673" Type="2">Acadie—Bathurst</Affiliation>. I have known him for many years and I know he is very committed in the fight to promote French, recognition, access for those appearing in court to their mother tongue and full and complete justice delivered in French. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500446"> I have no difficulty imagining areas of Canada where this situation is mishandled. In more fundamental terms, the merit of this bill is in its attack on the Supreme Court, the ultimate court of justice. We know this court's role. It is not only the guardian of rights. Of course, it has had the job of interpreting the meaning of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms since 1982. It has also has the job of keeping the law current. In doing so, it can invalidate certain provisions of the law or add to sections of law that may be considered incomplete. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500447"> The member for <Affiliation DbId="128673" Type="2">Acadie—Bathurst </Affiliation> rightly points out that, we should expect realistically that the people who have been appointed to the Supreme Court can understand both English and French without the help of an interpreter. The member for Acadie—Bathurst belongs to a party with very specific ideas on the appointment of judges and with which I have generally agreed. <Affiliation DbId="128673" Type="2" /></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500448"> It is the prerogative of the Prime Minister to appoint judges to the Supreme Court. Parliamentarians were consulted regarding the two latest appointments. I was on one of the committees myself. I recall that it involved appointing a judge to represent the prairies, Manitoba, specifically. With the current President of the Treasury Board, who was Minister of Justice, we looked at one judge's candidacy. When he appeared before us, it was very clear to us that he had no skill in French. He claimed to understand it and I did not doubt him. He was a worthy candidate. He had a good record and was very erudite, well versed in jurisprudence, and clearly had the ability to write—qualities of some importance in interpreting the law. I repeat that, in terms of his knowledge of the law, he was beyond reproach. However, it was troubling that the government was making this appointment. It was of some concern that the government lacked sensitivity and was putting forward a candidate who did not know French.<Affiliation DbId="105829" Type="4" /></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500449"> I put the question to this judge, who now sits on the Supreme Court. I asked him if he did not find it was a handicap not to know French. It is one thing to not know civil law, since it is not the legal tradition in the other provinces. But to not know French in the Supreme Court can be a problem when counsel and parties appear and a judge wants to evaluate—perhaps not so much the evidence, because it has been assessed at the trial level—or understand briefs, when points of law are raised or new law is being created. Only one jurisdiction, a single court, can change the law, and that is the Supreme Court. The other courts are limited to interpreting the law and remaining true to the intent of the lawmaker, but the Supreme Court can help to change the law. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500450"> Here is one example. In 1995, a legal challenge concerning sexual orientation was taken to the Supreme Court </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1500451">In 1982, when the constituent drafted the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, some members, including my colleague and friend Svend Robinson, who was then the member for Burnaby—Douglas, suggested that sexual orientation should be included in the charter. Of course, I was not in the House at the time, because I was barely 20 years old. So, in 1982, some parliamentarians proposed to add sexual orientation as a protected right under section 15. However, that request was rejected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500452">At the time, former Prime Minister Jean Chrétien was the Minister of Justice. Unfortunately, the groups that wanted sexual orientation to be included in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms did not succeed in their endeavour. This was followed by a very broad movement that lasted for several decades. The issue went all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada. In 1995, in the Nesbit and Egan case, the court ruled that section 15 must be construed as including sexual orientation. This is a very good example of the power, the ability and the prerogative of the Supreme Court of Canada to bring about progress in the law. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500453">The proposal made by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128673" Type="2">Acadie—Bathurst</Affiliation> regarding appointments is a very reasonable one. In fact, I cannot think of any instance where our colleague did not act reasonably, because he is himself a reasonable and moderate person. So, it is very reasonable to ask us to include a requirement to understand English and French without the assistance of an interpreter. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500454">Again, how can one truly render justice if one cannot read the submissions, or listen to the representations of all the counsel? Is there not also a symbolic value involved? If one is appointed to the highest court in the land, should one not be responsible for knowing French?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500455">I have not had the opportunity to discuss it with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128673" Type="2">Acadie—Bathurst</Affiliation> but, in my opinion, if a person is not perfectly bilingual but is committed to improving his knowledge of French, then this person should also be considered for the job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500456">However, there must be an obligation to achieve the desired results. Ultimately, when a judge is sitting on the bench to issue his first ruling or to hear the parties, whether by leave to appeal to the court or otherwise, that judge will have to know French and be familiar with that language and its subtleties. As we know, law is often about nuances, it can be convoluted and subtle, and it often requires us to be able to get into the substances, the nuances and the interpretations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500457">Of course the Bloc Québécois will support this bill. The Bloc first came here in 1990. In 1993, our parliamentary group expanded its representation under the skilful leadership of Lucien Bouchard. Also, as early as in 1995, my former colleague, Suzanne Tremblay—and some parliamentarians probably remember her—was given the responsibility, in Mr. Bouchard's shadow cabinet, of the dialogue that we must maintain with francophones outside Quebec. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500458">I remember that Mr. Bouchard, as leader of the Bloc Québécois—and a strong believer in the francophonie outside Quebec and in the necessary friendship and solidarity link that had to be established—announced a policy in Shediac, in 1994, entitled “Francophones d'Amérique : le temps d'agir”. The way we already understood the rights of francophones outside Quebec back in 1994, it included the whole issue of the administration of justice and, ultimately, that of the Supreme Court of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500459">I am going to conclude by congratulating the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128673" Type="2">Acadie—Bathurst</Affiliation>. I hope that all parliamentarians will support this balanced and moderate bill, which certainly deserves to be passed. </ParaText>

The bill proposes an extremely simple criterion for determining whether a person can be appointed to the Supreme Court or not:</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500462">It is difficult to determine the degree of understanding of another language necessary to carry out a task. In Quebec, the first criteria were set out under legislation governing the practice of certain professions some 45 years ago. These requirements changed over the years and were in particular incorporated into bill 22, the first recognition of French as the official language of Quebec. They are now part of the Charter of the French Language. For instance, as a general rule, in order to become a member of a profession, to join a profession, a person must have the appropriate knowledge of the French language to practice that profession.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500463">There are many pitfalls along the path to that knowledge. I remember the language tests of the day when I worked as a lawyer for the Conseil de la langue française, and then for Alliance Québec. These are extremely delicate matters, and that is why I really like this very simple and direct choice which does not require anything further. It simple states that one must be able to understand the English and French languages without someone else interpreting them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500464">Others have pointed out the importance of being able to grasp subtleties, and very often judges need to grasp and work with certain complicated ideas and concepts. We are spoiled here in the House. We have world-class interpretation. We are indeed extremely lucky to be able to count on the remarkable contribution of these women and men who work so closely with us. I use that order because the women are by far the majority. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500465"> In terms of the law, it is not always the same. I was also responsible for the translation of Manitoba’s laws. I revised the translation of all of Manitoba’s laws and regulations after the Supreme Court ruled in 1985 that Manitoba had to repair a historic wrong and start translating all its laws. I mention this point in particular to illustrate the importance of the message. Today, again, Graham Fraser, the Commissioner of Official Languages, was talking about the urgent need to have bilingual judges on the Supreme Court. Apart from the reasons I just mentioned, that is to say, how important it is to understand the nuances and so forth, requiring these judges to be bilingual is a powerful symbol. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500466"> When someone is a member of a linguistic minority, whether an anglophone in Quebec or a francophone in the rest of Canada, how can he expect the people before whom he is appearing to be sensitive to his case when it is about language rights—basic rights in a society with two official languages—if they are feeling defensive because they do not speak both official languages?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500467"> If someone never took the trouble to learn the other language or never was encouraged to do so, will he have the necessary sensitivity to decide a case of this kind? When I say someone who never took the trouble, I do not mean to criticize. We should look at it the other way around. What an incentive it would be for young law students to go back to school in order to perfect their knowledge of French. They could choose to have an internship with a company or a judge in order to improve or polish their latent knowledge of French, which they had learned a little in high school or in French immersion but which they had never really worked on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500468"> We have two legal systems in Canada. We are bijural, therefore, in addition to bilingual. The common law can be expressed as well in French as in English, as I just mentioned in the case of Manitoba. Quebec’s civil law has an English version which can be found in the Civil Code of Quebec. Both versions are equally authoritative, as has been determined, expressed and reinforced by the Official Languages Act and by decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500469"> How can we continue with this anomaly? When people appear before any other court whose judges are appointed by the federal government, it is a constitutional right to have a judge who can listen to them, serve them and understand them in their own language.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1500470"> There is only one exception. Do my colleagues know what it is? It is the Supreme Court. It is this incongruous exception that the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128673" Type="2">Acadie—Bathurst</Affiliation> wants to correct with Bill <Document DbId="3627679" Type="4">C-232</Document>, and that is why it is so easy to support him in this effort. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500471"> Canada is lucky to have two legal systems and incredibly lucky to have two official languages. I think that many people will see the powerful signal we are sending today as a reason to go and acquire a knowledge of French that is appropriate to the exercise of one of the highest offices in our country, a judge on the Supreme Court of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500472">I listened closely to the Liberal member who spoke earlier. I do hope that what he said reflects the official position of the Liberal Party of Canada. We will see when the time comes to vote. That said, despite all that the Conservatives have said to try and convince us that they have recognized linguistic duality as a reality in Canada, I think they will vote against this bill, even though it is exceptionally clear. We shall see.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500473">Anyway, we in the NDP are not speaking from both sides of our mouths on that issue. We do not hesitate to say that, with the opportunities we are given in this country to learn both languages, anyone who knows that a particular job requires that he or she be bilingual, will be motivated to learn his or her second language. This year is the 40th anniversary of the passage of the Official Languages Act. Similarly, anyone who aspires to a senior role in government now has an incentive to learn the other official language. Nearly all senior positions require a knowledge of both official languages. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500474">I had the opportunity to work in several provinces. I worked on the political scene for a long time in Quebec and Quebec City. When I came to Ottawa, I was quite shocked, not to say disappointed. I had always thought—it was naive of me, I realize it now—that official bilingualism existed and was alive in the federal public service. As it turns out, that bilingualism was largely an illusion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500475">In parliamentary committees, one must not try to get an answer in French, even from people who have had to prove their knowledge of French in order to obtain the job that brings them before the committee. There is still a big difference between the two sides. The francophones who appear before the committee and who fill important roles within the administration always try to respond in English—even though English might be their second language and they have learned it, but it still might be a little difficult for them—to a Conservative member who asks a question in English, for example. They make an effort, even though they are francophone and they are working hard at their English to be able to answer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500476">I am our finance critic on the Standing Committee on Finance. Government officials sometimes appear before our committee. We know they have had to demonstrate some knowledge of French in order to advance to their position. I am thinking of the person responsible for financial institutions who appeared last year. Although we were asking this woman questions in French, she stubbornly refused to answer in French. She consistently answered in English. That is very common, especially in the financial sector, and it is unfortunate. Clearly, the incentive that once existed is no longer working or it is no longer enough to make people want to retain the French they have learned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500477">If this bill passes, I think all the students embarking upon their legal studies at one of Canada's law faculties in September 2009 will always bear in mind that, in order to make it to the most important position a lawyer can aspire to, they must possess knowledge of languages. I am convinced that if these young, brilliant students have not already taken the time to learn French, or English as the case may be, they will find the time and the incentive to do so, since this will push them closer to that level of excellence, which includes, in a society with two official languages, the imperative need to know both official languages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500478">For that reason, and in closing, I wholeheartedly support my colleague's proposal. Furthermore, I would like to congratulate him for finding the right text and wording, a way to express it, that will win everyone over.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500479">I hope this will translate into a vote of support by the Liberals. We have already obtained the support of the Bloc. We will watch the Conservatives closely.</ParaText>

This bill would introduce a new requirement for judges appointed to the Supreme Court to understand English and French without the assistance of an interpreter. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500481"> The government firmly supports the promotion of English and French in Canadian society. As Canadians, we are proud of our bilingual institutions and especially the Supreme Court of Canada, which plays a fundamental role in our democratic society as the ultimate protector of the values set out in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The government's commitment to ensuring our courts have sufficient linguistic capability to guarantee access to a court in one or the other of the official languages applies to the Supreme Court of Canada as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500482"> The Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, makes the appointments to the Supreme Court. The justices in this court must be of the highest calibre. Accordingly, persons with the best legal knowledge and abilities must be chosen to fill the available positions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500483"> The Supreme Court Act provides for the composition of the court and the number of judges. It provides that at least three justices must come from Quebec. The composition of the Supreme Court of Canada reflects regional representation. The rest of the judges appointed come from Ontario, the Atlantic provinces, the prairies and British Columbia. The practice of ensuring regional representation guarantees that the most highly qualified and deserving candidates in the country are appointed to serve on the Supreme Court. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500484"> That does not mean, however, that everyone appointed to the court must be bilingual. In fact, the special nature of the Supreme Court as the highest court in the land and the fact that it has only nine judges from the various regions of Canada prompted Parliament to make an exception to the application of subsection 16(1) of the Official Languages Act in 1988. Bill <Document DbId="3627679" Type="4">C-232</Document> proposes to circumvent this exception. This would harm regional representation on the court. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500485"> The government's position is that the proposed amendments are not needed to guarantee access to the court in one or the other official language. The Supreme Court, as an institution, makes all its services and communications available in both official languages. Anyone appearing before the court has the choice of using English or French, in the presentation of both legal proceedings and arguments. The decisions of the court are also published in both official languages, and this helps establish ever expanding bilingual jurisprudence for all Canadians to consult. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500486"> The court shows on an ongoing basis that it is capable of performing its duties at the highest level in both official languages. There is nothing to indicate that the court has provided less than the highest quality legal services Canadians deserve and expect. I would ask hon. members to bear in mind the risk that the passage of this bill represents, especially since no one has implied that the justice meted out by the court is of anything less than the highest quality. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500487"> The proposed changes would make bilingualism a prerequisite for appointment. In view of the complexity and great importance of the cases heard by the court, judges must have more than perfect linguistic skills to understand subtle, complex legal arguments based on a profusion of factual evidence. An obligatory requirement like this would limit the pool of qualified candidates from parts of the country where the percentage of judges able to hear cases in both official languages is not as high as in Quebec or New Brunswick, for example. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500488"> The government obviously agrees that linguistic skills are a major factor in the process for selecting judges to sit on superior courts, including the Supreme Court. We will continue to give them ample consideration, as we did in our last appointment to the court, Justice Thomas Cromwell, an eminent jurist who is perfectly bilingual, highly qualified, and very worthy.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1500489"> That being said, the Supreme Court is at the very apex of our legal system, and in view of the important role it plays, the government feels that the overriding factor in the appointment of judges is and must remain merit based on legal excellence and personal aptitude.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500490"> Bilingualism is an important factor in the evaluation of candidates, but only one factor among others, including proficiency in the law, sound judgment, work habits, honesty, integrity, a sense of fairness and a social conscience.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500491"> We are very aware of the fact that our courts must have sufficient linguistic capacity to provide equal access to justice in French and English.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500492"> We should also distinguish between institutional bilingualism, which is historically part of the government’s responsibility to ensure that Canadian citizens are served in both English and French, and individual bilingualism, as advocated in Bill <Document DbId="3627679" Type="4">C-232</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500493"> At the present time, the Supreme Court, as an institution, provides services of the highest quality in both official languages. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500494"> The effect of Bill <Document DbId="3627679" Type="4">C-232</Document> would be that linguistic considerations would overshadow the most important consideration of all, merit, by reducing the pool of otherwise highly qualified candidates from parts of the country where there may be fewer lawyers and judges who are capable of handling cases in both official languages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500495"> It is not necessary to run the risk that the merit principle will be pushed aside out of a concern for bilingualism. The court already fully meets its objective of ensuring that Canadians have a right to be judged in the official language of their choice. All court services and communications are provided in both English and French.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500496"> All the current judges on the Supreme Court, with one exception, are perfectly proficient in both official languages and able to try cases in either official language without an interpreter. The judges also have the benefit of ongoing language training. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500497"> High quality interpretation and translation services are provided during court hearings and all judges are assisted by one or more bilingual employees. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500498"> The current requirements of the Supreme Court Act regarding the composition of the Court and the historical practice of regional representation allow us to fulfill our important commitment to legal pluralism, while ensuring that the people of Canada are served by judges who are very distinguished and extremely proficient.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500499"> The current court structure has provided Canadians with a solid, independent legal branch that is the envy of free, democratic countries around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500500"> The quality of the current members of the Supreme Court of Canada and their commitment to the job demonstrate how seriously the current government and previous administrations have always taken their responsibility to appoint judges to the highest tribunal in the land.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500501"> Bilingualism is one important factor in the process for selecting judges. However, it should not be allowed to outweigh the most important factor of all: a candidate’s merit and legal excellence.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1500503">Mr. Speaker, enough is enough. This bill is quite simple. It deals with the traditions that have existed at the Supreme Court of Canada for a long time. The Conservatives say that they will oppose the bill introduced by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128673" Type="2">Acadie—Bathurst</Affiliation>, which puts in place something that is already a tradition in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500504">Why? It is quite simple. A Supreme Court justice is not fully competent unless he understands both common law in English and the civil code in French. This is the minimum qualification for becoming a Supreme Court justice. However, the Conservative government refuses to accept the facts. It is precisely because it is incapable of understanding the qualifications required in the Supreme Court of Canada that Bill <Document DbId="3627679" Type="4">C-232</Document> was introduced by the member for <Affiliation DbId="128673" Type="2">Acadie—Bathurst</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500505">We have just been told that the Conservative government does not think that British Columbians can speak French. That just goes to show how out of touch the Conservative government is with the people, particularly the people of British Columbia. In the past, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> has even said that his Canada starts at the Atlantic Ocean and ends at the Rocky Mountains. He left out British Columbia entirely. It is clear that the Conservative government does not understand that British Columbia is one of the provinces in which the francophone population is growing in absolute numbers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500506">When I was a child, there were only two francophone schools. Now there are dozens of them. We have sixty or so in British Columbia because we have francophones from all over. We have a whole rainbow of francophones from Africa, Asia, Europe, Quebec of course, Acadia and western Canada. They all speak French as their first language, and that is changing British Columbia tremendously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500507">That is not all. More students attend immersion schools in British Columbia than anywhere else in Canada. Our schools are packed. Sometimes parents wait in line all weekend long to register their kids at these schools.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500508">For the Conservative government to suggest that British Columbians cannot speak French is insulting. It is simply not true. It is insulting to the people of British Columbia and to people elsewhere in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500509">With respect to qualifications, it is clear that people are going to immersion schools and even to management schools. These people understand French well, can speak it, and are studying law. At some point in time, they will meet the minimum requirements for the Supreme Court: they will understand common law in English and the civil code in French.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1500510">I certainly do not understand this drive by the Conservatives to lower standards. We have seen it in a whole variety of things, such as air safety, transportation safety, and food safety. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500511">The Conservative government always seems to want to push for lower qualifications. There are two basic qualifications for a Supreme Court judge: the ability to understand the civil code in French and the ability to understand common law in English. Those are simple and important requirements only at the Supreme Court level. The Conservatives do not seem to understand that and that is why we have the bill that is before us today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500512">The idea that higher standards and stronger qualifications are not taken into consideration is something that I find objectionable. That we need a lower standard of service, that we do not need the qualifications that have served us well in the past seems, in many areas, to be the objective of the Conservative government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500513">That is why the Conservatives are opposing this simple but important private member's bill put forward by the member for <Affiliation DbId="128673" Type="2">Acadie—Bathurst</Affiliation>. The bill would reinforce those qualifications and standards to ensure that every Supreme Court judge understands the civil code in French as well as common law in English. I would be equally opposed if the Conservatives appointed unilingual Francophones who do not understand common law in English because the function of the Supreme Court is too important to do that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500514">However, that is not what the Conservatives are saying. They seem to be saying they are just going to choose whatever standards they want. We have seen what that has meant in a whole variety of areas. We have seen poor financial management from the government. Those qualifications are unfortunate, but that is the net result. We have seen a whole variety of lower safety standards. We see this drive from the government that does not make sense. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500515">I do not accept lower qualifications and I do not think any member of Parliament should. We should set a higher bar and this legislation would set the bar to what traditionally we all understood, that a Supreme Court justice needs to understand common law in English and the civil code in French. It is very simple. Nothing has to go through translation, nothing has to go through interpretation. Supreme Court judges must be able to function adequately in the two official languages, so that they can pass through the two legal codes that are often written in two different languages.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1500516">That is the issue that is before us. We hope that the Liberal Party of Canada will support this bill. We know that the Bloc Québécois said it would support the bill and that the NDP has always been consistent when it comes to the issue of official languages. It is not just the member for <Affiliation DbId="128673" Type="2">Acadie—Bathurst</Affiliation> who is fighting a pitched battle to win respect for the official languages in Canada. The entire New Democratic Party has done so since it was formed, and not just at the federal level, but in all the provinces, including mine, British Columbia. It is the NDP that has brought about these changes to respect linguistic duality in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500517">In British Columbia, a French-language school system was created under an NDP government, as in Saskatchewan. In Manitoba, the official languages bill was introduced and implemented by an NDP government. In Alberta, it was Léo Piquette, an NDP MLA, who pushed for respect for the official languages. In the Yukon, it was an NDP government that introduced the bill to respect French and English. In Ontario, the college system was put in place by an NDP government, and in the Atlantic provinces, NDP MLAs were among those who pushed hardest for language rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500518">We are not two-faced. When a New Democrat talks about official languages in British Columbia, Manitoba or the Atlantic provinces, he or she pushes for mutual respect and linguistic duality. We do not act like certain other parties that may say they are in favour of the official languages in this House, but who start attacking the official languages as soon as they leave Ottawa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500519">We have seen this with the Conservative Party, with the Reform Party and, sadly, with the Liberal Party in western Canada. Outside Ottawa, the Liberal Party has always attacked francophones at the provincial level. Unfortunately, the Liberal Party has a sad history of saying one thing in Manitoba, British Columbia or Saskatchewan, but another thing in Ottawa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500520">We are consistent. We are the only party in the history of the country that has always been consistent on the issue of official languages. That is why we fully support this bill. That is also why we support the principle that a judge should have the qualifications to become a Supreme Court justice. In other words, judges must be able to understand common law in English and the civil code in French. That is why we will vote for this bill.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1500521">Mr. Speaker, with all due respect to the hon. member who just spoke and the member who sponsored this private member's bill, I believe that all members can agree that the Supreme Court consistently demonstrates that it has the capacity to conduct its business at the highest level in both official languages and there is no indication that the court has provided less than the highest quality of justice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500522">There has never been any question that the quality of the decisions of our highest court is lacking or that there is a failure to indeed understand the law. Is the hon. member suggesting that the rulings of our Supreme Court are not impartial and objective when the justices use the interpretive services available? With the greatest respect, if this is the suggestion, then I must disagree in the strongest possible terms. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500523">To the contrary, institutions such as the Supreme Court of Canada have enabled our country to forge an international reputation as a peaceful, democratic and stable society. The court is respected and admired all around the world and stands as a symbol of Canada's shared commitment to opportunity, fairness and the rule of law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500524">The hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128673" Type="2">Acadie—Bathurst</Affiliation> is concerned about the interpretation services at the Supreme Court and suggests his concerns are based on his experience with the interpretation service provided to this esteemed chamber. I do not think that the quality of interpretation, whatever the hon. member's concerns might be, is in any way relevant to this debate. The interpretation and translation services available at the Supreme Court are of the highest quality and the interpreters are professionals trained to capture the legal complexities of the arguments before the court.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500525">No one can reasonably suggest that the judges of the Supreme Court are not able to fully appreciate and understand the representations made by lawyers during hearings. I am confident that the individuals appointed to the Supreme Court will continue to make an outstanding contribution to the work of the court and serve this country honourably. It is therefore essential that the best and the brightest be appointed on the basis of legal merit, excellence and personal suitability. Bilingualism is certainly an important factor to be considered prior to making an appointment, but must be weighed among many others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500526">I ask myself, would the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128673" Type="2">Acadie—Bathurst</Affiliation> like to see a highly qualified French jurist excluded from sitting on our highest court simply because he or she is not bilingual and does not possess the capacity to, in using the terminology of the hon. member, understand the subtleties of the law in the English language? I would suggest not. The hon. member's bill would do exactly that. It would exclude a brilliant mind from the Supreme Court.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500527">The Supreme Court of Canada is in many respects a unique body because it usually sits collegially with all nine judges chosen from different regions of the country hearing some of the most important constitutional and legal cases of our times. Indeed, it was such considerations that militated in favour of exempting the Supreme Court from the duty imposed upon other federal courts in section 16 of the Official Languages Act in 1988.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500528">I will again stress to hon. members the fact that this bill hinders regional representation by limiting the pool of qualified candidates in regions of the country where a percentage of potential qualified candidates capable of hearing a case in both official languages is not as high as in Quebec and in the member's home province of New Brunswick.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1500532">Mr. Speaker, first I would like to thank the House which, through the democratic process, has debated Bill <Document DbId="3627679" Type="4">C-232</Document>. This legislation is important for all Canadians using either official languages. My arguments can be summarized with the following question: do we accept the fact that our country has two official languages?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500533">I also want to thank the members for <Affiliation DbId="128381" Type="2">Moncton—Riverview—Dieppe</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="128293" Type="2">Hochelaga</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="128308" Type="2">Outremont</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="128312" Type="2">Lotbinière—Chutes-de-la-Chaudière</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="128505" Type="2">Burnaby—New Westminster</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="128581" Type="2">Fundy Royal</Affiliation>, for their comments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500534">I would like to correct something that the member for <Affiliation DbId="128581" Type="2">Fundy Royal</Affiliation> said. He said that the member for Acadie—Bathurst had mentioned that interpreters in the House of Commons were less competent than other ones. I never said that, and the member should apologize. That is not what I said. I said that in committees—and this has nothing to do with the quality of our interpreters—when a person speaks rather quickly, like me, sometimes the interpreters cannot keep up with that person. They ask me to slow down. In committee, we often get messages from interpreters telling us that we talk too fast. They ask us to slow down a bit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500535">Let us imagine that we are at the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land, and that a judge or a lawyer says that he did not understand something. This is the highest court in the land, in a country that claims to be bilingual, that has two official languages and that passes legislation in Parliament that is drafted in English and French. So, I am asking myself a question. When a judge has heard a case and returns to his office, does he take an interpreter with him to translate the French act, or to read the English legislation? Where is the justice here?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500536">Four or five years ago, the current <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada did not speak French as well as he does now. He has learned French, and I congratulate him for doing so. He knows that if he wants to serve our country, he must speak both languages. I will make no bones about the fact that, seven years ago, the NDP leader also did not speak French as well as he does now. He made an effort. However, the judges on the Supreme Court of Canada do not have to make that effort. They hear cases, but the citizens involved cannot go to the United Nations to appeal the decision. The Supreme Court of Canada is the last resort.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500537">There will be a vote tomorrow evening. I am calling upon Parliament to support Bill <Document DbId="3627679" Type="4">C-232</Document>, which states clearly that the judge must be capable of reading and understanding the law in both of this country's official languages. Voting in favour of this bill at second reading means it will go to committee and there it will be studied and we will hear from experts. The Canadian Bar Association, the Association des juristes d'expression française du Canada, the Young Bar Association of Montreal, the Fédération des communautés francophones et acadienne du Canada, the Quebec Community Groups Network, and even the Premier of Quebec support the bill. They can see that it is a good bill. Why not study it in committee?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500538">The Conservators choose not to. They do not even want it to go to committee. This is regrettable, coming from a government that claims to respect our two official languages. Even the Commissioner of Official Languages says it is essential to send a message. Even university spokespersons from Toronto say it would be a good thing. In four or five years, someone aspiring to a position on the Supreme Court will learn both official languages.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1500552">Mr. Speaker, I am here for the adjournment debate tonight because I asked a question in the House and did not receive a satisfactory answer. Some might say that I will not receive a satisfactory answer tonight, but I will give it one more try.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500553">On February 12, I asked a question about the elimination of two programs that subsidized tours: PromArt and Trade Routes. The elimination of these programs really hurt artists who tour abroad. As I told the minister on February 12, if not for help from an Italian producer, La La La Human Steps, a dance company, would not have been able to go to Italy. It makes no sense that artists now have to ask foreign producers to cover their travel and shipping costs. Traditionally, in industrialized nations, artists, cultural organizations, dance and theatre companies offer their services to foreign producers, who pay their fee, and the home country covers travel and shipping costs for the artists, their sets and their costumes. That is how it has always been done. That is how every other industrialized country still does it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500554">So, in addition to the performers' fees for La La La Human Steps—which, as we know, is a very modern dance company—a foreign producer had to pay for their transportation. That is a huge blow to Canada's reputation and that of its artists. As we can see, the Conservative Government of Canada no longer wants to support its artists so they may travel abroad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500555">Just this morning, in today's paper, Alain Dancyger, executive director of Les Grands Ballets Canadiens, criticized the situation. Indeed, because of the Conservatives' incompetence and their refusal to subsidize a dance company like Les Grands Ballets Canadiens, the company is now facing a shortfall of $150,000. A dance company involves a lot of people and a lot of cargo, including sets and costumes. They needed $250,000 right off the bat every year in order to tour abroad. That is what the Canadian government had been giving them in subsidies through a program called PromArt, which had a budget of several million dollars. Thus, the executive director of Les Grands Ballets Canadiens, Alain Dancyger, strongly criticized the situation this morning. He said he was very embarrassed by the fact that he had to seek out funding from a country like Egypt. To depend on donations from Egyptian companies, because our own country—a G8 country—cannot support us, as he said, is unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500556">One must wonder what it will take for the Conservative government to listen to reason and restore the programs that have been eliminated. Of course, every time I ask a question of this nature, the government always plays me the same old broken record. It probably already has it queued up. It will say, “Our government has made record investments in culture”, which is not exactly completely accurate. It will add, “The Bloc Québécois voted against it.” I would remind the House that the Bloc Québécois voted for this government's budget on May 10, 2006, and on March 27, 2007. I hope it will have some other arguments this time. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1500557">Mr. Speaker, if they keep asking the same question, they are going to get the same answer. It is like groundhog day here in the House. I get up every day and I think that maybe we will move on and we will get to something where we can actually establish that every answer I have given is in fact true and we will move on beyond that. However, as I say, it is groundhog day every day; it is the same question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500558">The hon. member has given me an opportunity to talk about this government's record. She cited a couple of groups in Quebec. I am proud to say that those groups have received, and do receive, substantial support from this government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500559"> She said that I would mention that our government has put record funding into the arts. That is true. There was $540 million in budget 2009 and yes, the Bloc Québécois voted against it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500560">The Bloc also came up with a Bloc stimulus package, but what was not in the Bloc stimulus package was so much as a mention of the arts. Where was it? It is a pretty thick document. It is probably 50 pages long. The Bloc could not even work the arts in. If I were in the Montreal arts sector, I would be really upset with the Bloc. What can I say? The Bloc forgot about the arts sector. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500561">Who did not forget about the arts community is the Conservative government. In budget 2009 we made an outstanding number of investments, more money than any government in history. The hon. member is well aware of this. In fact just to cite a couple of examples, there is $60 million in additional funding for cultural infrastructure projects; $20 million in new funding for training institutions; $100 million for festivals from coast to coast to coast; a $25 million endowment that will showcase emerging artists on the global arts scene. We have increased the funding for the Canada Council from $150 million a year to $181 million. That is a 17% increase. All the arts groups have come forward and thanked us for putting that additional money into the Canada Council because that is artists helping artists. That is what our government has done. We have increased the funding for the CBC each and every year that we have been in government. I hear from Quebeckers how popular Radio-Canada is. We have increased its funding each and every year. That is what this government has done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500562">What has the Bloc done? It produced a stimulus document that does not even mention the arts. I did not have anything to do with that. The Bloc did that. Maybe in her follow-up question the member will be able to explain why the Bloc forgot about the arts, why it voted against the arts when budget 2009 came up. The Bloc record in the last few months is kind of shameful, to be perfectly honest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500563">It is clear that this government is standing behind the arts. The member can look at our record and at the investments we have made. It is very clear we are standing behind the arts. We understand the value of a vibrant arts and culture sector in Canada. We are standing behind it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500564"> What is also clear is that the Bloc forgot about the arts in its stimulus package. The Bloc also voted against the budget. It is also clear that each and every time I come into this House on the late show questions, it is groundhog day.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1500566">What is more, on that same day, February 12, I had a question for the <Affiliation DbId="128706" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Heritage and Official Languages</Affiliation> concerning the Canada prizes. We know these were created to please the people in charge of Luminato, and their promotional documents were even cut and pasted into the budget. The purpose is to give hundreds of thousands of dollars in bursaries to young foreign artists, when what we were asking of the government was money for our artists to enable them to go abroad. They absolutely did not get it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500567">Three months ago, almost to the day, the minister answered me by saying that there was another project besides the Luminato one. He said he would show it to me and it would be made public in the very near future. He also said that he would be able to talk about it and make factual comments. I would love to talk about it but here we are, three months later, still with no public announcement of any kind. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1500570">Mr. Speaker, I rise in this adjournment debate to speak to a very important matter that I raised with the minister on March 13, the job losses in my province of New Brunswick. The reality is that the Conservative federal government has not done much since coming to power. In addition to squandering the surplus left by the previous government, it has racked up an incredible deficit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500571">We wonder if we have hit bottom yet. We are no longer talking about a deficit of $1 billion or $34 billion. We are now talking about a deficit over two years of approximately $120 billion. When will this unreal deficit level off? In the meantime, tens of thousands of workers have lost their jobs across the country. When people lose their jobs, their families lose their livelihood.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500572">In his reply, the <Affiliation DbId="105829" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation> stated that the members of the Liberal Party had obstructed or attempted to delay the economic action plan. I would like to refresh his memory. In November 2008, the government and the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> prorogued Parliament in order to shut it down completely. Basically, it was a way of covering their backs and avoiding a vote of confidence that they would have lost. When the time came to do something, it was already too late. The economic action plan was presented well after the crisis had taken hold.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500573">In the meantime, people are continuing to lose their jobs and to apply for employment insurance. They often need another 9, 11, 13 or 15 hours of employment to qualify for employment insurance. One thing we are asking for is a 360-hour threshold for benefit eligibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500574">There is one area where the government is really dragging its feet on going ahead with the economic action plan and job creation. In towns in my riding, the Conservative government boasted about making an announcement in March of this year. Two months later, these same municipalities were still waiting for the go-ahead to issue calls for tenders. Today, municipalities where the government made its announcements in March 2009, two months ago, are still waiting for the go-ahead just to issue a call for tenders. To be legal in New Brunswick, a call for tenders has to allow a 21-day bidding period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500575">When will these infrastructure projects really start? In July, August, September, October or November? Winter will come and nothing will have even started. The government talks about creating jobs. When people lose their jobs and we want to put them to work again, the government should not claim that the Liberals were blocking things. We need to look at what the government has done to date. It is making announcements, but it cannot give the go-ahead at the same time. Meanwhile, people have lost their jobs and are not working, and other people are losing their jobs and not starting to work again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500576">Where is the Conservative government in all this? People need to start working again. We need to stimulate our economy. Meanwhile, people are sitting at home waiting to find a job or be called to work in construction.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1500577">Mr. Speaker, I will certainly relay for the member for <Affiliation DbId="128549" Type="2">Madawaska—Restigouche</Affiliation> some of the things that we have been doing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500578">We are concerned about the job losses being experienced by Canadians but let me be clear that our government is absolutely committed to helping Canadians through this time and we will continue to help them through this difficult time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500579">Our government is making unprecedented investments to help vulnerable and unemployed Canadians. Among other things, we have extended EI benefits by five weeks, which is more than double the two weeks advocated by the opposition. We have extended the work-sharing program. More than 100,000 Canadians are being protected by working with Canadian employers to share costs and avoid layoffs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500580">We were and are investing $500 million in skills training and upgrading for long-tenured workers, $1 billion in further training through the EI program and $500 million in training for those who do not qualify for EI. We made changes that will process claims faster and cut red tape for employers. To do so, we have invested more than $60 million for processing, including hiring additional staff to manage the workload and to implement the budget measures. We are monitoring the effectiveness of these measures to ensure they are effectively helping Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500581">What we will not do is implement the Liberals' 360 hour, 45 day work year idea. The opposition members can say what they want about this scheme but that fact is that it is irresponsible at this time. It is a proposal that would result in a massive increase in job-killing payroll taxes that would hurt workers and businesses alike, especially small businesses that already run on tight margins. The Liberals now say that this scheme will not require higher taxes and that it will come from general revenue. However, where does general revenue come from? It comes from taxes and Canadian workers in businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500582">This irresponsible proposal would not help Canadians find new jobs or get new skills. It would simply add billions to the tax burden on Canadians. However, that is not surprising given that the Liberal leader is borrowing an ill-conceived NDP idea. The NDP have never seen a tax they did not like. However, the Liberal leader is also ignoring the Liberal Party's previous position in this regard from the last time they were in government. The former Liberal government said:</ParaText>

I took the minister at his word. It was 70 days before we received any type of response from the government. The response that we had was a first step. I am not sure if we could consider it a half-hearted step, but what is extremely important to all of us as members of Parliament is to ensure that we have a timely resolution to what is a growing concern for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1512948">That growing concern can best be expressed by a simple fact that the interchange fee, that is the fee that is charged to the merchant for receiving a credit transaction, has been increasing sometimes to the tune of more than double.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1500609">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my friend, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128252" Type="2">Pickering—Scarborough East</Affiliation>, for his question, as well as his work on the joint committee to which he referred.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500610">In recent months, concerns surrounding the practices of card issuers have garnered increasing attention in the areas, as the member has said, of interchange fees as well as interest rates, business practices and marketplace structure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500611">Parliament is formally examining this important issue, as the House of Commons finance and industry committees along with the Senate banking committee are currently undertaking studies. In fact, as a member of the finance committee, when possible I have participated in the joint finance-industry hearings on this very subject. We heard from the processors of debit, credit and the gift card transactions. Additionally, the Competition Bureau has also launched an investigation on the competitive environment in which interchange fees are set.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500612">As part of our economic action plan, our government recently announced strong new consumer protection rules with respect to credit cards. Among the new proposed regulations are summary boxes on contracts and applications, clearer implications of minimum payments, timely advanced disclosures of interest rate changes, a minimum 21-day grace period, express consent for credit card increases and limits on debt collection practices, and more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500613">We believe that when Canadians make the choice to use a credit card, they are not signing away all their rights. As well, Canadians should not need a magnifying glass and a dictionary to read their credit card agreements or applications, and they should not have to be a lawyer to understand them either.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500614">We are focusing on greater clarity and more timely disclosure from credit card issuers when dealing with consumers. Our new consumer friendly rules will empower Canadians by making it easier for them to shop around for the credit card best suited to their needs without fearing they will be taken advantage of later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500615">Numerous public interest groups applauded our aggressive consumer friendly measures. For instance, the Consumers Association of Canada remarked that all of the things the finance minister has done are actually just what it asked for and that overall, it has to congratulate him. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1500616">The Retail Council of Canada declared that it was “pleased that the finance minister has taken these steps today. It demonstrates that the federal government recognizes just how serious the problem has become”.</ParaText>
