              <ParaText id="1261482"> She said: Mr. Speaker, this is an extremely important bill because in Canada there are no mandatory minimum sentences for human trafficking convictions, not even for children. The October report of the Canada-U.S. consultation, in preparation for the world congress against sexual exploitation of children and adolescents, recommended that Canada amend its Criminal Code to provide a mandatory minimum penalty for child trafficking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261483">In Peel county right now numerous trafficking charges are on the table, hopefully, with convictions, and this kind of bill would ensure that traffickers have very stiff sentences. This is very mandatory.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261484">As members know, last year a Niagara man was convicted of human trafficking. He earned $350,000 off a 15-year-old girl over the period of two years. He only received three years and received a credit for 404 days of time already served.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261485">These mandatory minimum sentences for trafficking of children are of paramount importance here in Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1261487"> She said: Mr. Speaker, this bill would amend section 24 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act by adding subsection (3).</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261488">It is important to underscore one aspect of this subsection. With this amendment, an immigration officer would no longer be able to take into account the possible participation of a victim of trafficking in persons in a criminal investigation or proceedings in respect of that criminal offence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261489">I will explain why I am proposing this. Currently under the legislation, when a person is a victim of human trafficking, the immigration officer takes into account whether the alleged victim will collaborate or not in a criminal investigation into the criminal offence. The problem, however, is that many of these victims are so traumatized that often they do not have the physical, psychological or mental ability to participate in an investigation or possible criminal proceedings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261490"> I hope this bill will enjoy the support of my colleagues. I may say that those organizations, NGOs in Canada that work on this issue, are very supportive of this amendment.</ParaText>

I have introduced this bill in each new parliamentary session since 2004, when Dorval was added to my riding, but the Electoral Boundaries Commission has refused to add the word “Dorval” despite the municipality's request and despite petitions from voters in the entire riding. This is the fourth or fifth time I have introduced this bill. I am doing this at the request of a large number of my constituents from Dorval as well as Lachine, Montreal West and NDG who are asking that Dorval be added.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1261496">She said: Mr. Speaker, my bill would require labels on clothing to include a reference number that consumers could use to identify the name and address of the factory where an item of clothing was produced. This measure has been highly recommended by a number of advocacy groups, including the Ethical Trading Action Group and Amnesty International. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1261499">According to Amnesty International and the Ethical Trading Action Group, if the public knows exactly where products are being manufactured, businesses will then have to self-regulate for fear that civil society will use this new tool to publicize the names of the companies responsible for unfair employment practices.</ParaText>

For those of my House colleagues who may not have heard of him, Mathieu Da Costa was an interpreter. He is credited with being the first black man in Canada and was likely an important player in European exploration of the continent. Da Costa is believed to have worked alongside both Pierre du Gua de Monts, a leader in the establishment of French settlements in eastern Canada, and Samuel de Champlain, who selected the site for the settlement that later became Quebec City. As we all know, Quebec City is celebrating a major milestone: its 400th anniversary.</ParaText>

It is the right to repair bill and it looks at two different acts: the Competition Act and the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. This bill is important because of the changes in the auto industry with regard to on-board diagnostic equipment. That change has led to a number of different servicing requirements that are necessary yet difficult to obtain. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261506">I would point out that the Canadian auto industry is not alone in terms of the consequences of this bill. Similar legislation in the United States and Europe has adapted different techniques to deal with the fact that the new types of technology create problems for people and consumers who service their vehicles. Hence, this bill would allow the proper process and procedures so that independent automobile associations can procure the data, tools and materials necessary to fix vehicles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261507">It is important for competition as well as for the environment.

In particular, the proposed bill mirrors the political system, where for the first $1,275 that a person gives, charities will be able to issue a greater tax break back to the middle and lower income earners, who will get a better return. It treats the system fairly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261510">This is a significant change that would help the industry. The charitable industry sector is around 8% of the Canadian economy. It employs two million people in great causes, everything from seniors to children, universities and colleges. I would request that all members support this bill. It is important for economic stimuli. It is ironic that the last two budgets passed by this Parliament, the Conservatives actually reduced the amount of charitable tax one gets back as an individual Canadian citizen.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1261539"> Mr. Speaker, it is a bit of a pity to cut a presentation into two parts. However, I will recap for the benefit of my colleagues here this morning what I said yesterday. I pointed out that, given the spirit of openness shown by the current government in this economic context, and in particular given the fact that the government had recognized Quebec as a nation just two years ago, I had expectations of considerable openness from this government with respect to recognizing the demands of the Government of Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261540">The main demands related to the equalization formula. The Government of Quebec is opposed to the changes to this formula, because it stands to lose $1 billion as a result. It is also opposed to the formation of a single pan-Canadian securities regulator, because Quebec wishes to retain its own securities commission, Since Quebec sees this as a cultural issue as much as one of economic control, it would be important for the government to recognize these demands by the Government of Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261541"> I will now move on to the rest of my speech in greater detail. Following on what I said yesterday, I wish to state that we regret that the bulk of workers who lose their jobs will continue to have no access to employment insurance, according to what was presented in the budget this week. Older workers are again marginalized, because there are no measures for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261542">As for the fiscal imbalance—to which I have already referred—Quebec stands to lose $1 billion, up to $2 billion next year, according to the forecast. Quebec will therefore sustain losses with respect to health, education and family policy, all under provincial jurisdiction in our parliamentary system, as we know. In addition, the Conservative government is making a gift to Ontario with its calculation of the dividends from Hydro One compared to those from Hydro-Québec. Quebec will therefore lose an additional $250 million in equalization.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261543">Culture is one of the essential elements of the Quebec nation. Many Quebec cultural troupes take Quebec culture around the world and their substantial performance incomes benefit the entire Quebec economy. The Conservatives' refusal to eliminate the announced cuts to culture —a sector of such importance to the economy—will continue to mean suffering for all of the regions of Quebec, as will their refusal to backtrack on the cuts inflicted on economic development bodies. We will get back to that point, because a great deal has been said about it already recently, yet this week's budget does not touch upon it at all. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261544">I would also like to point out that this Conservative budget is contrary to the Kyoto accord and thus contrary to the economic interests of Quebec and of the environment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261545">This budget contains some questionable ideological choices. Overall, the budget is clearly lacking, and it is hard to imagine what would have happened if the Conservatives had a majority, because we expected that the government would make concessions in response to demands from the different regions. Even though this is a minority government, it ignored those demands. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261546">he tax cuts are not targeted. A family earning $150,000 will get more than a family earning $40,000. These tax cuts will help neither people who lose their jobs nor companies that do not turn a profit. By the Conservatives' own admission, in opting for corporate tax cuts, they chose the measure that would stimulate the economy the least. That amounts to putting ideology before the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261547">As for social housing, the Conservative government is injecting $2 billion into social housing, but most of that money will go to renovations, while very little will go to building new units. Quebec alone needs an additional 52,000 units, according to one social housing agency. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1261548">In July 2007, in my own riding, having received the support of the voters in Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, I asked the <Affiliation DbId="128704" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> to take action in response to calls to revitalize the former penitentiary in Saint-Vincent-de-Paul. The government owns this building and could have converted it into new social housing. But there is no mention of this project in the budget. I would remind this House that the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation has an $8 billion surplus, but the government is not using one cent of that money in its budget for new housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261549">The government should have used the budget to adjust the guaranteed income supplement so that low-income seniors in dire need could at least reach the poverty line. Clearly, this is an oversight. If only seniors were provided with additional income to bring them up to the poverty line, they would spend money, which would be injected into our economy and not lost.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1261551">Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I want to let you know that I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128297" Type="2">Edmonton—Sherwood Park</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261552">It is with great pride that I stand in the House today to speak in support of budget 2009. The people of <Affiliation DbId="128788" Type="2">Nunavut</Affiliation> have shown faith in me by electing me to the House and I would like to take this time today to outline how our government has shown faith in them with budget 2009.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261553"> I am humbled every day that I am given the opportunity to serve as their member of Parliament and to be their voice in Ottawa. In my home territory of <Affiliation DbId="128788" Type="2">Nunavut</Affiliation>, across Canada's north and, indeed, across the country, we are in the midst of a period of great change. We must not be spectators to this change but instead shape the future by doing the right thing for people who elect us to this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261554">A synchronized global recess is hitting every economy in the world. Canada, as a great trading nation, is feeling the effects. In the last election campaign, the voters of <Affiliation DbId="128788" Type="2">Nunavut</Affiliation> elected a Conservative MP to serve in a Conservative government. This government was elected to lead the country through a global recession, and we are keeping that promise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261555">Two days ago, my colleague, the hon. <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, delivered Canada's economic action plan. It is our plan to stimulate our economy to protect Canadians through the global recession and to invest in our long-term growth. These are the priorities of Canadians and they are the priorities of this government. This plan was built upon one of the broadest and deepest consultation processes in Canadian history. We listened carefully to the concerns of Canadians about their jobs and their savings, about their families, businesses and their communities. We heard their concerns and we took their advice. Now we are taking immediate action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261556">I would like to turn to infrastructure for a minute as this is one of the cornerstones of our economic action plan. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261557">As Canadian families are taking steps to build infrastructure in their own homes, we are taking actions to build infrastructure across the country. We know that getting shovels in the ground today will create jobs for Canadians now, while providing the framework for Canada to grow upon in the years to come. We are building and renewing our municipal territorial infrastructure, our post-secondary research and health infrastructure and our key federal assets. The money will flow quickly and we will get the shovels in the ground quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261558">For communities like those in <Affiliation DbId="128788" Type="2">Nunavut</Affiliation>, it will mean real benefits: more people working, more people selling their products and a better quality of life. We are talking about the infrastructure that people generally identify with such as roads, bridges, water and sewer systems. However, we are also talking about the recreational side of infrastructure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261559"> The budget introduced recreational infrastructure Canada that would provide $500 million to support construction of new community recreational facilities and upgrades to existing facilities across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261560">In addition, I am proud to say that <Affiliation DbId="128788" Type="2">Nunavut</Affiliation> won big in budget 2009 through the following projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261561"> First, the budget commits up to $17 million to accelerate the construction of the Pangnirtung small craft harbour. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261562">Second, an additional $100 million over two years to support renovation in the construction of new social housing units in <Affiliation DbId="128788" Type="2">Nunavut</Affiliation> has been committed in the budget. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261563">Third, the Piqqusilirivvik cultural facility in Clyde River will receive funding from the building Canada fund on a priority basis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261564"> Finally, <Affiliation DbId="128788" Type="2">Nunavut</Affiliation> will receive its fair share of the $87 million, over two years, to invest in maintaining or upgrading key existing Arctic research facilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261565">For those Canadian families that will face job losses, we will take immediate action. Supporting Canadians in the short-term when they face a job loss is important, but it is equally important to help them find new long-term job prospects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261566">We are strengthening employment insurance with new benefits and increased availability of training for those who lose their jobs. For example, we will extend work-sharing agreements by 14 weeks, to a maximum of 52 weeks, so more Canadians can continue working. For two years, all regular EI benefits entitlements will be extended for five extra weeks. We will also increase the maximum benefits duration from 45 weeks to 50 weeks.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="35">(1035)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1261567">To prepare those who have lost their jobs for better jobs to come, our economic action plan increases funding for training delivered through the EI program by $1 billion over two years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261568">Our measures will also extend to those who do not qualify for EI. They will help young Canadians find summer jobs, support older workers and their families through the targeted initiatives for older workers, respond to skilled labour shortage by giving financial help to apprentices to complete their training and to continue our support for a national foreign credential recognition framework.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261569">During a global recession, some communities face unique challenges, especially if they rely on a single industry to drive their economies. Canada's economic action plan takes this into account. It creates a two year community adjustment fund worth $1 billion to help those communities diversify their local economies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261570">With regard to specific sectors of the economy, we are offering targeted support for a wide range: industry, forestry, manufacturing, tourism, agriculture, mining, shipbuilding, fisheries and the automotive industry. All of this targeted help will help our economy in Canada and in Canada's north.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261571">Canada's economic action plan gives a shot in the arm to the home construction and home renovation industries, both key drivers of our economy. It allows first-time home buyers more flexibility to withdraw from RRSPs to make their purchase and gives them a break through a tax credit on their tools and costs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261572">Our plan also includes a new measure to let Canadians invest in the value of their homes, while putting trades people to work and giving a boost to those businesses that make and sell building products. For the next two years, a new home renovation tax credit will apply to the cost of labour and supplies and can save Canadians up to $1,350 when they improve their homes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261573">We are taking action to help families and stimulate consumer spending. Nunavut families deserve more money in their own hands to meet their own needs. Our Conservative government has made that principle a cornerstone since we took office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261574">Our record of tax relief is substantial and it is providing stimulus to Canada's economy as I speak. Canada's economic action plan builds on this. We are giving more tax relief, letting Canadians earn more money before paying higher taxes. We are building on the benefits that exist for low income Canadians. This is of particular importance to many citizens in my communities. The working income tax benefit is being increased as an added incentive for Canadians to join and remain in the workforce.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261575">Seniors will see new support. We are increasing the age credit amount by an additional $1,000. We are also reducing the amount Canadian seniors are required to withdraw from their registered retirement income fund by 25% for 2008.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261576">The bottom line is this: this year and over the next five years, our personal income tax measures will put about $20 billion back in the hands of Canadians and back in the Canadian economy to keep it moving forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261577">Let me be very clear. This budget is the best one I have seen for Nunavut and Canada's north. It commits more money for housing, jobs and new infrastructure. All of this will help to improve the quality of life of northerners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261578">The budget comes after extensive consultation from the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and other federal ministers, all of whom travelled from coast to coast to Arctic coast to hear from thousands of Canadians. I personally met with the territorial premiers and health ministers and with many of my constituents. I am pleased that the economic stimulus package reflects what I have heard from my constituents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261579">Nunavut will continue to receive historically high and growing federal transfers in 2009-10 that will total $1.1 billion. This is an increase of $125 million from last year. This long-term, growing support helps ensure that Nunavut has the resources it needs to provide essential public service and to build our territory into the great jewel of Canada, which I believe Canada's north is destined to be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261580">I have already mentioned that the budget strengthens support for economic activities in the north with $50 million over five years to establish a new regional economic development agency specifically for the north. Nunavut will receive its fair share of the $140 million set aside over five years for strategic investment in the northern economic development program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261581">The budget also commits much needed funding for social housing in Nunavut. In addition, Canada's government will improve Arctic research facilities and will accelerate the construction of the Pangnirtung harbour.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="40">(1040)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1261582">In conclusion, Canada's economic action plan meets the challenges of our time. It is a balance between stimulating our economy for the short term and building our capacity for the long term. This is especially vital in Nunavut and Canada's north. It is a balance between putting money back in the hands of Canadians and creating new investments. It is a balance between the unfortunate reality of a short-term deficit and the principle that we will not burden our children and grandchildren for today's--</ParaText>

I am sure she was concerned today when she saw the article in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> that says that a key science agency in Canada has been left out of the budget. Genome Canada, which is responsible for some of the most significant and ongoing medical research, the most extensive and largest medical research projects in Canada, was completely ignored in the budget. In past years it received funding, and in fact last year, it received $140 million in research funding. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261593">This is very important research to many Canadians. It is very important for health research, for instance. It allows Canada to participate in international work that is being done in genetic research and yet this funding has not come through in the current budget.

If businesses cannot get credit, they cannot continue to function. Families were concerned with their savings and paying their bills. Students were concerned about finding work once they were finished their education. Seniors were concerned about their own personal finances. These were just a few of the concerns expressed to me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261606">I am honoured to say that I can now go back to my constituents with pride. Our Conservative government is helping Canadians in this time of economic difficulty. This economic action plan is exactly what Canada needs in so many ways. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261607">In this time of economic hardship, the Conservative government of Canada is reducing the tax burden to help those hit hardest by the downturn. This government stands by its belief that the best place for people's money is in their own pockets. That is why across the board this government is helping people maintain their earning power, pay fewer taxes, and regain the confidence they have lost. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261608">While the crisis did not start in Canada, this Conservative government is acting to help Canadians affected by it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261609">We are increasing the basic personal amount that all Canadians can earn before being forced to pay income tax. For those with the lowest earnings in the country, those struggling to scrape by, this will allow them to earn more money before they are taxed. We have also raised the upper limit of both the lowest tax brackets. Those who have seen their earnings decline because of the economic slump can rest assured that the government is acting directly to aid them. These tax cuts will help the people immediately. There will be no need for Canadians to wait for funds to trickle down. They will feel the impact of this action plan right away.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261610">This government has created other measures to help those in our society who are rendered vulnerable by the economic downturn. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261611">We have increased the age credit by $1,000, benefiting 2.2 million seniors. Combined with the other measures we have instituted for seniors, such as pension splitting and the increase in the pension income credit, the Conservative government has ensured that it will support seniors during this recession. These measures for seniors, when put together, provide almost $2 billion of aid to the seniors of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261612">We propose in this plan to nearly double the working income tax benefit, ensuring that those who decide to work and contribute to the economy are never punished financially for their actions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261613">I believe the greatest stimulus is to give the people of Canada their money back and let them decide where and how to spend it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261614">Members of the NDP have made it clear that they do not think that the people of Canada deserve this money. They have made it clear that they desire to keep taxes high, even in the midst of a recession. They have made it clear that they do not want to support businesses. They have made it clear that they do not want Canadians to get back to work. The <Affiliation DbId="128276" Type="2">leader of the NDP</Affiliation> decided to oppose this budget before he even knew what was in it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261615">The Conservative government knows that, if given the support they need, the Canadian people can and will overcome the challenges that our nation faces. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="55">(1055)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1261616">We know that during trying economic times the Canadian people represent our greatest strength. We know that ultimately this government is responsible to Canadians and that it is the Canadian people who have allowed us to be here and who have given us the mandate to work together to help them get through this economic crisis affecting the entire world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261617">The solution for Canada is the economic action plan this government has put forward. This economic action plan will create opportunities across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261618"> We will not mince words. The next couple of years will not be easy. While deficit spending is not comfortable for any of us, we have to be responsible and act. There is no room for political manoeuvring when Canadians' livelihoods are at stake.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261619"> That is why I am pleased this budget has shown both forethought and planning. We will see our nation return to balanced budgets within about five years. This action plan has the right combination of protection for Canadian workers and training for their future to bring us into prosperity once the economic seas have calmed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261620">This economic slump is a period of transition for our nation. That is why we are working to provide learning and training opportunities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261621">Our Conservative government spent almost $2 billion on training because we believe that Canadians who seek a new job, a new career and a new life for themselves and their families should be able to count on the Government of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261622">We will spend $500 million over two years on a strategic training and transition fund to ensure that it is not only those who benefit from EI who have access to training. We will invest $50 million into our future by helping young Canadians find summer jobs. We will address the shortage of skilled workers in our nation by launching a $2,000 apprenticeship completion grant. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261623">Finally, we will fulfill the dream that has brought so many people to Canada from other countries, including my own parents: the dream of a better life for themselves and for their children. Through partnerships with the provinces, this government is committed to developing a national foreign credential framework. Highly skilled immigrants can come to Canada knowing that the value of their education will be recognized here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261624">The renovation tax credit in the action plan will impact an estimated 4.6 million Canadian homeowners and will allow our families to improve their homes. By implementing a temporary home renovation tax credit, our Conservative government will be benefiting homeowners in Alberta for up to $338 million over two years. The temporary nature of this credit will provide an immediate incentive for Canadians to undertake new renovations or to accelerate planned projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261625"> These renovations will add to the growing green economy, allowing the people of Edmonton--Sherwood Park and Fort Saskatchewan to purchase energy efficient appliances by providing $300 million over two years to the eco-energy home retrofit program. Our government is expecting to support an additional 200,000 energy-saving home retrofits that will be kind to the environment and will keep more money in the pockets of Albertans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261626">Given these troubled times, our government recognizes the undue strain placed on first-time home buyers and the negative effects it directly places on their future aspirations. Our Conservative government is providing a first-time home buyers' tax credit that will provide tax relief to those families looking to purchase their first home. In addition, we will increase the amount that first-time home buyers can withdraw from their RRSPs to purchase a home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261627">Small businesses are the foundation of our economy. Our Conservative government understands the immediate action that must be taken to support businesses within our communities. Our dedication to sustaining strong, competitive businesses will not only create revenue for Albertans and Canadians alike, but will also stimulate jobs and investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261628">We are dedicated to increasing access to financing for small businesses through proposed amendments to the Canada small business financing program and the Business Development Bank of Canada. In addition, we are increasing the amount of small business income eligible for the reduced federal tax rate of 11% to $500,000 from the current limit of $400,000 as of January 1, 2009.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261629">In the consultation process for the budget we heard loud and clear that Canadian financial institutions have been less willing to lend to credit-worthy Canadian families and businesses. The Canadian secured credit facility will be created, with an allocation of up to $12 billion to support the financing of vehicles and equipment for consumers and businesses. This measure will also help the auto industry to increase sales, as they have been hit particularly hard by this recession.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="00">(1100)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1261630">With access to financing, Canadian families can continue to make the purchases that keep the economy moving ahead. It will be easier for people to get car loans. Businesses will be able to purchase new equipment, invest in their operations and grow in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261631">Once again, I am proud to be a member of this party and this government, a government that has put this country and its citizens first, ahead of all party politics. This is an economic action plan that will help our entire nation move forward to create jobs, hope and prosperity. This is an action plan that will bring our economy in from the cold and support the Canadian work force.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261632">I am pleased to see that it has gained the support of the official opposition and I applaud their decision to put the Canadian people before politics.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1261633">Mr. Speaker, I have listened carefully to the member's speech, and he has done a pretty good job of running through the index of measures in the budget. I am not sure he has actually completed the list; there are so many measures in this budget that one actually does need an index to go through it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261634"> I am not sure that every measure in that budget is as stimulative in impact as the suggestion is here. Two items pop out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261635">The member could not resist his party's neo-con desire to give tax money back to the taxpayers. I am not so sure that economically that item is a stimulus. He could not resist mentioning it, which is okay. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261636">However, there is a second thing I want to ask about. The member mentioned that the increase in the income tax personal amount would result in a tax saving to the lower-income Canadian taxpayer, but is it not a fact that the personal amount is claimed by every taxpayer, even the Prime Minister? The Prime Minister has a tax break that is similar to, or better than, the poor person's. I am going to ask the member why he did not mention that upper-income Canadians have tax breaks as good as, or better than, the one he has just somewhat myopically described.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261637">Was it the government's intention to give a better tax break to the high-income earners than to the poor? That is exactly what this budget contains.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261638">As for my party's alleged support for this budget, we are going to squeeze the budget through. We are going to make it fit. We are going to put the round peg through the square hole so that Canada benefits, but the government is on probation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1261642">I also did a lot of consultation during the prorogation of Parliament. The people I spoke to were concerned about a lot of things. I am going to raise a couple of their concerns here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261643">First , I would like to know why the budget, allegedly supported by the Liberals, does not include the elimination of the two-week waiting period for people applying for EI. As members know, during that two-week period people still have to pay their mortgages. They still have to pay for their hydro, and the kids still get hungry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261644">My second question concerns reducing the number of hours to qualify for EI, something else my constituents brought up. A couple of weeks ago I had someone in my constituency office who was missing seven hours to be eligible for EI. I would like to know why the Conservative budget, supported by the Liberals, did not include reducing these hours.</ParaText>

A surplus was even predicted as early as November, despite Canada's having the second-worst-performing economy of the G8 nations for the first half of 2008 and despite losses of 105,000 jobs in the last 60 days.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1261652">I am pleased to take part in this very important budget debate. Over the break I had the opportunity to consult with my constituents of Don Valley East to discuss what they would like to see in the budget. They made it clear that a stimulus package must contain measures to protect the most vulnerable in our society, to secure the jobs that we already have, and to prepare Canadians for the economy of tomorrow. Small and medium size businesses wanted access to credit. Before I go into the details, I would like to review the events that led to this juncture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261653">Last November the Conservatives provided an economic and fiscal update that nearly led to the collapse of the federal government. By all accounts the speech delivered in the House by the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4"> finance minister</Affiliation> on November 27 had been penned by partisan zealots in the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister's</Affiliation> office with little or no consultation with officials in the Department of Finance. On hindsight it represented the greatest parliamentary boondoggle by a prime minister in Canadian political history. The government was then forced to withdraw its statement when a proposed coalition by the opposition parties nearly toppled the Conservatives. This process was only stopped by a last ditch effort by the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> when he shut down Parliament prematurely in order to regroup and buy precious time for the Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261654">It took this crisis for the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to realize that in the midst of a recession it is highly inappropriate to play partisan games, especially at the expense of Canadians who are losing their jobs. In order to survive, the Conservative government has been forced to listen to the official opposition and produce an action plan for the Canadian economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261655">In the economic statement of last November, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4"> finance minister</Affiliation> claimed that Canada would not be affected by the global economic downturn. He also claimed that Canada would not only avoid a deficit, but it would even generate a small surplus. Quite incredulous, it is not clear why the finance minister totally ignored the advice of his departmental officials or why he was completely oblivious to the signs that signalled both a recession and a potential for a deficit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261656">A mere eight weeks later, the Conservative government now admits that it is already $16 billion in the hole, well before any stimulus package is even contemplated. That is why the Liberals are demanding greater accountability and so are my constituents of Don Valley East.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261657">The people in my riding made it clear that the budget must protect the vulnerable in our society. They want their pensions protected. They want seniors to enjoy their retirement without fear of the future. They want retraining for the jobs that they have recently lost and better access to employment insurance benefits. They do not want the federal government to sell off public assets to cover for poor fiscal management. It makes no sense to hold a fire sale of public assets and sell at the lowest possible price during a recession.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261658">I know that it is not in the DNA of the Conservative government to invest in social housing, to expand both the working income tax benefit and child tax credit, or to take climate change seriously. However, I am pleased that after cross-country consultation by the new <Affiliation DbId="129313" Type="9">leader of the Liberal Party</Affiliation> the government has finally conceded that a stimulus plan is urgently needed and has taken suggestions from the Liberals. This being said, Canadians are deeply disappointed by the economic performance of the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261659">In 2006 the Liberal government handed over to the Conservatives a fiscally sound government and an unprecedented fiscal record: a $13 billion surplus; the lowest inflation rate; the lowest unemployment rate; and the best economic record of the G8. In less than three years and against the advice of nearly every economist in the country, the Conservatives embarked on a reckless and irresponsible spending spree. Now the Conservatives have announced that Canada will run a $64 billion deficit over two years. That is $77 billion in the hole. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1261660">What does this mean for ordinary Canadians and my constituents, who want to ensure that the jobs Canadians have are value-added jobs? If we translate $77 billion lost into value-added jobs lost, it is approximately 154,000 good jobs which are lost, jobs that pay well. Had the government been more prudent, it would have saved those 154,000 jobs. What would that have meant for the economy? It would have provided stimulus to the economy because the people in those jobs would be spending, contributing to the government coffers and avoiding bankruptcy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261661">To make matters worse, the Conservatives boasted that they paid $37 billion off the national debt, which currently stands at approximately $457 billion. Now the 2009 budget will wipe out that achievement. The current situation threatens to wipe out any progress of debt reduction achieved by the Liberals between 1998 and 2006. Servicing the national debt is the single largest federal expenditure. It eats up nearly a quarter of the federal expenditure and passes the burden along to future generations of Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261662">Canadians demanded fiscal responsibility. That is why the Liberal Party is granting only conditional support for this budget. Some of my constituents are asking why the Liberal Party is choosing this path. The simple answer is that we just had a federal election only three months ago. I would rather that the $360 million it costs to hold a federal election be spent on retraining workers, investing in infrastructure or helping new Canadians gain recognition of their academic credentials. Canadians want to see their country succeed. They want the government to apply the same principles of good government that the Liberals gave Canada from 1993 to 2006.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261663">We all remember it was the Liberal government that ended the Mulroney era of deficit financing which almost drove the country into the ground and led the IMF to call Canada an economic basket case. The Liberals inherited a $42 billion deficit in 1993 and successfully restored the country's finances by 1998. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261664">We can succeed, but only if the <Affiliation DbId="128634" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation> can resist partisan impulses and concentrate on the economy, Canadians and jobs.</ParaText>

I seem to recall, when I look back to those dark, cold Liberal years, that $54 billion was basically stolen from the EI program, from employers and employees, cuts in transfer payments for health and social services to the provinces, and a promise to abolish the GST which was quickly forgotten.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261667">Moving to the recent history of our country for the three years that the Conservatives have been in government, what do we have now? Of the G8 countries, we are the only country that has run a surplus over the last three years. Every one of the other countries has run deficits in each of the last three years.

The suggestion that Liberals can kick the Conservatives out of office whenever they want is their own suggestion. It is not an actual fact in the amendment. Also, the amendment does not provide a procedure or opportunity to deal with issues later on. The Liberals are going to support the Conservatives unconditionally over the next number of months. The Liberals will eventually turn against the Conservatives but they will not have any mechanism to actually change things.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1261679">Mr. Speaker, I can see where the hon. member is coming from. The specific tools available to any Canadian are the tools of democracy. The Conservatives will be booted out because they are not people who know how to manage an economy. They have been fudging the figures. They are $16 billion in deficit even before starting the stimulus package.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1261681">Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to speak to the budget. I first want to thank my fellow islanders for their input at a joint town hall held between the MP for <Affiliation DbId="128131" Type="2">Charlottetown</Affiliation> and myself. We appreciated islanders' input and we forwarded that on to our finance people, eventually to the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>. Some of that input did get considered and put in but, sadly, a lot of it did not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261682">I spoke on the economic statement just two short months ago and I have to ask this. On what planet were the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Conservative Party just two months ago with the economic statement? The Prime Minister was in denial that his policies at that time were leading the country into deficit. Now we know we are in deficit, as my hon. friend said, to the tune of $15.7 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261683">Is the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> still in denial today that his policies were leading our country into deficit and that his and the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>'s statements during the election were to a great extent untrue? In fact, they were untrue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261684"> In two short years the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> have taken our country, Canada, and driven it not only to the brink of deficit, but into deficit. Worse yet, because of their spending and their inability to manage the fiscal capacity of the nation, they spent the cupboards bare and the reserves are not there anymore to do what has to be done when a country needs a stimulus package. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261685">We should not be surprised. As we said in previous debates, that is the same <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> who drove the province of Ontario into deficit and it has been suffering as a result for decades since he was there. Now the same Minister of Finance has provided the same tragedy for Canada as a whole.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261686">As my colleague said, this budget tries to cover up the fact that the government already has a deficit. Economists are saying there needs to be a $30 billion stimulus package this year. The government is saying it will have a $34 billion deficit, leaving the impression that this is the stimulus package. On page 217 of the budget document, we find the government is already in a $15.7 billion deficit because it could not manage the affairs of the nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261687"> Therefore, there really is not a $30 billion stimulus package, there really is not a $34 billion stimulus package, there is only a stimulus package of $18 billion, which is not enough. I felt I had to draw out that fact. Even with the consequences and the trouble the nation is in at the moment, the government tries to cover up the fact of how it managed the economy in the past.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261688">However, Canada needs an economic stimulus, jobs for today and jobs for tomorrow. One of the areas where we need them the worst is in the province of Prince Edward Island.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261689"> I am concerned that the equalization cuts announced by the government in this budget will hurt Prince Edward Island and the principle of the program for the long term is being undermined. Stimulus is needed even more now than it was in the past in those provinces that receive equalization. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261690">Let us look at a few facts that relate to P.E.I. The government announced in its first budget the building Canada fund, which would provide P.E.I. with up to $40 million over four years. However, after two years, only the existing programs, MRIF and CCIP, have been committed. Not one dollar has flowed from the Conservatives' building Canada fund, only political announcement. What we get from the government is mostly smoke and mirrors. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1261691">The bureaucratic red tape put on municipalities is of the Conservatives' making. No dollars have been spent, yet the government still runs deficits. Under the proposed new, if I could call it that, accelerated plan with its one-third requirements, it is very doubtful that municipalities and provinces could participate. Again, it would only be political announcements because they would not have the money to put in their share.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261692">Prince Edward Island's fiscal capacity will be further reduced by the budget under the Conservative plan. Like all Atlantic provinces, P.E.I. would have their transfer payment increases, which were agreed upon in November, reduced by up to 50% by 2009-10. P.E.I. would have cuts to health care and social programming as a result of these federal decisions. At an economic time when we really need that money, the federal government is cutting back the funding. That will put the province in the position of having little fiscal flexibility to participate in any new spending for infrastructure, primary industries and skilled training.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261693">Discussions are taking place on the community adjustments fund. As I understand it, there is not one dollar being considered for rural community stimulus. Not one dollar is being considered to stimulate agriculture, which is in real trouble. Not one dollar is being considered for innovative jobs for tomorrow. That is a huge problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261694">Agriculture seems to be the forgotten industry in this budget. The government's record, as we know from this file, has clearly been one of failure. However, in Prince Edward Island, for instance, the Conservatives announced crop loss payments of $12.4 million. However, they set up a program that prevents farmers from receiving the money. With farmers facing bankruptcy, $9 million is going to go back to the federal accounts. The program was very poorly designed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261695">I see the <Affiliation DbId="111560" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture</Affiliation> is here. He announced a $500 million agriflex program, which is something we committed to in the budget. However, the previous commitment was $500 million for what could be considered companion programs over four years. Now, it is over five. When one looks at it, the $500 million is not really $500 million; it is only $190 million because of the restructuring of existing programs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261696">We are seeing too much smoke and mirrors from that government. We need to get that money to the farm community. Worse than that, the agriflex program, as I understand it, will not apply to the RMP in Ontario or the ASRA program in Quebec. That creates huge difficulties for getting that money out appropriately to those farmers on the ground. The budget announced $50 million for increasing the capacity of the slaughter industry. However, how is that going to be designed? Will it only go to the big packers, who already control too much of the industry, or will it go to the primary producers where it can do the most good?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261697">In the budget, there is, in fact, credit availability and more money made to the Business Development Bank of Canada and Export Development Canada, which is a good thing. What about the Farm Credit Corporation? Farm Credit is more difficult to deal with than the lending institutions. There does not seem to be any increased money to that agency, nor a lessening of the credit conditions that would allow farmers to stay on the land.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261698">Those points are very important, as they apply to the farm community. Much more needs to be done. In fact, I had a call today from a constituent in the minister's riding who was very concerned about the lack of response from the <Affiliation DbId="111560" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture</Affiliation> on the beef and hog crisis in our country. It has been in disarray for two years and all the government seems to do is extend loans. We cannot borrow ourselves out of debt. We need some real actions that will put us on a comparable footing with our competitors in the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261699">The government's record is terrible and its word is often broken. This party, through our amendment, will hold it to account.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1261761">Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to speak today in support of the government's economic action plan. This budget will be a test of political maturity. Canadians have been watching with great interest and quite literally praying that we parliamentarians get it right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261762">This budget is a test of our Conservative government. It is also a test of the Liberal Party, the Bloc and the NDP. More important, it is a test of minority government itself. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261763">What is the standard against which we are being tested? What do Canadians want? How will we know whether we have passed? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261764">Two results are important to Canadians. First and foremost, Canadians want us to work together. Second, we must respond competently to the worldwide economic slowdown. If we do not work together, we will be incapable of any response whatsoever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261765">We will not succeed if we insist upon a mean-minded lack of trust. If we harbour grudges over past disagreements, if we refuse to even listen to one another, that will be picking up one's marbles and storming off home, and Canadians will recognize that for what it is. We also will not succeed if we play power games, if we all try to be king of the hill, if we insist that this budget must be exactly what we want. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261766">My community of Kitchener has a pioneering tradition of conflict resolution. As a lawyer for almost 30 years I have learned that a good compromise is one where everybody feels disappointed. If any party in the House thinks it will get everything it wants in the budget, then it has failed the test.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261767">Ironically, that is why minority government fails the test. Many good ideas that would serve our country well cannot be pursued because they will offend one party or another. Despite the luck of one or two minority governments 45 years ago, good ideas succeed more in spite of minority governments than because of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261768">My favourite example is the abolition of the anti-democratic state funding of some but not all political parties. This excludes many people who would like an equal voice in our politics, but I know that this democratic reform will not pass in this minority government. Therefore, I am glad that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had the political maturity to take it off the table.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261769">Has our government passed the test in this economic action plan? Resoundingly yes. Has our government set aside some good ideas because they were not acceptable to the opposition? Of course. Has our government incorporated some ideas that some of us might have wished not to? Of course.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261770">The government is not going into this by ignoring what our parliamentary partners and others have had to say. We are not trying to be king of the hill. That is not what Canadians want. The government has listened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261771">This plan is the product of greater consultation than any other in Canadian history. The government consulted with over 680 groups. There were 84 ministerial trips across Canada to gather input. Opposition leaders and first ministers were consulted. Over 70 formal round tables were held to solicit ideas. We heard from business, labour, taxpayer groups, farmers, the auto sector, and the list goes on and on.</ParaText>

Some, like extended EI benefits, more retraining opportunities and greater tax breaks for the working poor, have been incorporated into this budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261775">This economic action plan contains many ideas gathered through such consultations, from investments in social housing, roads and bridges infrastructure to modest tax cuts. It includes measures to provide needed financing to businesses and to individuals.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1261776">This is an economic action plan to create opportunities for Canadians. Our plan will stimulate housing construction and provide support to business and communities. This budget will take action for aboriginals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261777">For the first time in Canadian history, southern Ontario, hard hit by this recession, will get an economic development agency to provide seed money for new job creation. This could be called Canada's first knowledge budget. It dedicates almost $4 billion to enhance post-secondary education and Canadian research. I am happy to say this includes $50 million for Waterloo region's world-class cutting-edge Institute for Quantum Computing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261778">All of this builds on our Conservative government's far-sighted planning over the last three years. Reducing the GST has provided ongoing stimulus that kept us out of a recession while all around us others were failing. Cutting business taxes kept us creating net new jobs. Paying down $37 billion of debt in just three years gives us room to manoeuvre now. Think of what that means. Even after this challenging year with a $34 billion deficit, Canada will still have less debt than when our Conservative government took office. Our economic plan responds to global economic turmoil that worsened so quickly it was referred to as gale forces by the deputy chief economist at BMO. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261779">Since this October, every private forecaster has been amending their forecasts downward almost every week. If any party pretends that it saw this much difficulty coming this quickly, it is kidding the public and Canadians will see right through it. If any party pretends that these problems were created by our Conservative government, it is kidding the public and Canadians will see right through it. If any party pretends that it could have produced solutions more quickly than this action plan in this complex time, it is kidding the public and Canadians will see right through it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261780">Is this plan completely agreeable to everyone's principles? No. Is it absolutely the best economic action plan that any government in a minority could produce? Resoundingly yes. Does this plan take action to protect Canadians? Resoundingly yes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261781">Our Conservative government has passed the test. The Liberal Party has also passed the test. Putting aside these humourous little jibes about being on probation, the Liberal Party has responded favourably to Conservative efforts. I respect the hon. opposition leader for admitting, “These measures stand to offer actual hope for actual Canadians”. I further agree with the hon. opposition leader in saying the political system did work. It would disappoint fans of the hon. opposition leader's eloquence to hear him try to claim credit for all the many good things in this budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261782">If we all focus on the economy and on protecting Canadians, we can agree that this is not a Conservative budget, it is not a Liberal budget, it is not a coalition budget. This is a Canadian budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261783">In my address in reply to the throne speech and on the fiscal update, I invited all hon. members to travel the path through this dark forest of economic peril together with a common focus on the needs and well-being of all Canadians.

Our <Affiliation DbId="128634" Type="2">industry minister</Affiliation> is on top of this file and has commented on it. He is aware of it.

He said that the government had delivered by extending benefits by five weeks for people who currently qualify for employment insurance. The fact is that the government has done nothing to expand eligibility for employment insurance in this time of high unemployment. The government has not extended benefits. It has not gotten rid of the two-week waiting period. It has not dealt with the issue of severance pay. It has not expanded the number of people who would be able to collect employment insurance at all. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261793">We know that only 32% of women become eligible for employment insurance claims. We know that only 38% of men in Canada are eligible to make a claim. The government has done nothing to raise that figure. It has done nothing to ensure that other unemployed Canadians can take advantage of a program they have paid into. Canadians know there has been a huge surplus of what has been taken in, in terms of the premiums that Canadians have paid into the EI fund over what has been paid out in benefits. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1261800">We saw this come to a head in my area of Windsor and Essex county and Chatham Kent when a contract for almost a quarter of a billion dollars was recently awarded for a truck to be built for the military. Instead of awarding that contract or putting in the RFP to ensure Navistar would build it in Chatham, it is going to be built in Texas. It is unacceptable when a quarter of a billion dollars of procurement goes out this door to reward people in Texas. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261801">Ironically, in 2002, I was fighting with the auto workers to protect that plant. The Liberal government at that time originally said that we could not do anything to assist or facilitate that plant to ensure it had a future. It denied all those things. It said that we could not do it under NAFTA and it used every excuse. However, it finally capitulated and we were able to successfully keep that plant going until today with a modest investment and that retooling was very successful. The money helped the plant develop for the future. It has had good jobs since that time and has paid for itself in spades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261802">Workers and their families have been able to live a solid life and donate to the United Way and other causes and actually return the investment to the taxpayers of Canada through income tax. We will now watch that plant go down and be eliminated, while at the same time we will be supporting a plant and a facility in the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261803">There are other examples of that by the current government in its past. The Conservatives have a history of it. The ecoAuto rebate program, for example, which is still in the program the penalty axe back. It is important to note the type of strategies the government does not acknowledge or fix. When that program was put in place it literally had Canadian taxpayers' money going to Japanese vehicles made overseas with the Yaris, in particular, getting the actual incentive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261804">It is very difficult to support a government that does not plan its position properly. We will see a lot of the stimulus exit this country. We will do what the Americans did when one of George Bush's packages went out, which was basically cheques to Americans. What they discovered was that only 10% of the money went back into the value-added American economy. The rest of the money was either saved or lost in banking scandals or exited the country as other manufactured goods were developed overseas. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261805">The problem with supporting the government right now is that we are seeing a supposed rush to fix the problem that the government has denied for so many years. Over a series of years the government has not only denied but also worked against some of the issues that needed to be fixed. The manufacturing sector, for example, is an obvious one. Over the last five years we have lost nearly 300,000 jobs in manufacturing across this country. It did not just happen yesterday. It has been happening for a number of years in different successive industries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261806">Without supporting a sectorial strategy, whether it be the textile industry, which we watched collapse in Quebec, whether it be the auto industry in Ontario, Quebec and other parts of Canada, or whether it be the shipbuilding industry of the past, there was no sectoral development. Now, all of a sudden, there will be a solution to these things despite the Conservatives denying it for so many years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261807">It is important to note that people were setting off alarm bells. It was not just Parliament over the last number years. A motion from the Corporation of the County of Essex, which was passed December 10, 2008, called for the county to forward a letter to the Premier of Ontario and <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada endorsing the position of the Ontario Mayors for Automotive Investment, as outlined in correspondence dated November 24, 200,8 calling for urgent action to address the crisis in the automotive sector.

              <ParaText id="1261810">He was referring to the auto industry. Now he has changed his tune and says that he will be there but the problem is that the Conservatives do not really understand the situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261811">When the county of Essex and others raised the issue of lost auto manufacturing jobs, the government chose to attack instead of putting in an actual plan or having an actual vision. We have seen the jobs disappear. Canada used to be the fourth assembler in the world and we are now down to ninth and losing even more. The government has ignored the reality of what is happening. It is important to note that its divisive nature is what has caused the lack of confidence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261812">What ends up happening next is that the government scrambles around asking what it should do now. The United States is implementing a bridge loan program. It drops its rhetoric of attacking the industry and driving away the possibility of future investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261813">The <Affiliation DbId="128698" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> gets on a plane and goes down to Washington but does not really meet with anyone. I accessed his travel expenses and it cost $601, plus the cost of the challenger jet. We do not know how much that cost but I am sure it was quite expensive to fly that into Washington. All the minister gets is a document that could have been downloaded from the Internet. This is the actual system that the United States went through. It had open, accountable procedures to go through its automotive investment bridge loan that it was going to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261814">We do not have that over here. We have not had a single public meeting. The government wants to put out billions of dollars but does not want to provide any access to the agreement. The only thing the minister has done is to attack workers by insisting that we would have the same conditions in our agreement as the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261815">The minister has given up our sovereign decision to even look at what a package could be. He has said that the senators from Alabama, the senators from Tennessee and the United States Congress should make the decisions for Canada as we put billions of dollars on the line.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261816">What is worse than that is the fact that the government has still not come to the recognition that the year before the United States put $25 billion aside for an innovation research fund for the automotive industry to turn it green. What has happened in the meantime, as the United States has been doing those things, Canada has lost investment opportunities, which is unacceptable. I will point to one of the most successful ones.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261817">Despite the Detroit three getting a bad name with regard to hybrids, they actually have the most hybrids on the market. Investments are happening right now. General Motors, because of this incentive program, is actually building a battery factory in Detroit. It is building the Volt as well, the first electric commercial vehicle that will hit the roads. However, that investment has gone to Detroit and the United States because they actually had an auto policy. Meanwhile, our government has not even had CAPC meetings. We actually passed a call to action plan that was supposed to be implemented back in 2004.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261818">The Conservatives do not need to be supported anymore. Too many workers and their families have lost their jobs, not because they have not been productive, not because they have not gone to work every day and done everything they should and not because they have not had the opportunities, because we have had those opportunities, it is because a government policy was never developed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261819">Ironically, in this budget the government claims it will come up with one in a couple of weeks. For years the government has said that it actually has a policy and now it says that it will table a policy in a few weeks and that we should trust them. We are supposed to trust them with billions of dollars, with no accountability, no plan, no public meetings, no action, no type of input and, at the same time, it will come up with a plan later on. It is too late.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261820">We need a new plan and that is why we want to replace the government and see workers protected as opposed to being isolated and thrown out of their jobs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1261822">When we talked to manufacturers in 2007 they said that if we could change the rate at which we write off their capital equipment, that would be incredibly important for a five year period. We presented that report in February 2007 and it was in the March 2007 budget for a two year period. It was then extended in 2008. In this budget we do get the full five years.</ParaText>

However, it is unfortunate that the other 20-plus recommendations were never acted on. The important difference is that we asked for a five-year complete window, which is important for the cycle of investment. We heard from the investors that they needed a five-year cycle. What we got instead was two years and now a revival of perhaps another three years, but that does not guarantee the full cycle. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261826">If the government really wanted to help, it would have done the full five-year cycle so that it could plan out the medium and long term investments.

              <ParaText id="1261827">Madam Speaker, it is ironic and very helpful to have both the member for <Affiliation DbId="128282" Type="2">Edmonton—Leduc</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="128491" Type="2">Windsor West</Affiliation> who has just spoken.

              <ParaText id="1261829">Is there actually a guarantee for any stimulus package that is provided? As a committee travelling through his riding, we were concerned that money that could be spent on a stimulus program, particularly in the automotive sector, may actually not get to suppliers and that the unintended consequence could be that jobs would be created in other parts of the world as opposed to our communities where they are badly needed, including Windsor.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1261831">With regard to the unspent money, it is tragic that we were not taking this money and acting. We had opportunities, which is why I highlighted GM. It procured a Korean-type technology for the battery system for its electric vehicles as well as the Volt itself. Even a company that is challenged right now is setting up a brand new environmentally friendly vehicle and we did not even compete for that. Here in Canada it took a lot of hard movement and pressure to get the federal government to even participate in a new engine development at Ford in Windsor. It is one of the good things that has happened. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261832">At the same time, it showed the differences. General Motors will be investing billions of dollars in the United States accessing its new manufacturing $25 billion loan program. Meanwhile, we have not had a response to it. These are difficult things. If we do not talk to the U.S. about what it is doing, then we either need decide to get in the game or not. We need to be careful about how we do that but we do need to make that decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261833">One of the things we are worried about is the ecoAuto rebate program where Canadian taxpayers' money went abroad to basically support other industries. The United States is looking to protect its industries right now, whereas we actually shovelled it out. Ironically, it kept the tax part on the vehicles. It added new taxes on top of those vehicles and a lot of that money comes from vehicles made in Canada. That is unacceptable.</ParaText>

These speeches have been made before but they need to be underscored. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261835">There is also the inability of many communities across the country, particularly in my province and others, to access the infrastructure funds because of the requirements of contributions from the municipality and the province. In fact, the president of the St. John's Board of Trade, in my province of Newfoundland and Labrador, said that it was like going onto a frozen pond, seeing someone who had fallen through the ice and offering to sell him a life jacket for $9, saying, “I will pay the additional $12 if you give me the $9”. It is a metaphor which shows how inadequate this is in dealing with the needs of our municipalities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261836">However, I cannot rise in the House to speak to the budget without talking about what has happened outside of the budget papers and budget documents, but is very much a part of this budget. It is the back door changes that were made to the equalization formula, which has the consequence of taking $1.6 billion from Newfoundland and Labrador.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261837">This is a body blow to the fiscal situation of our province. It is $3,000 per capita for every man, woman and child in Newfoundland and Labrador, a significant amount of money. The comparison has been that for Ontario, it will be equivalent to $22 billion. For Quebec, it will be $14 billion. It is a significant, horrendous blow to the fiscal ability of Newfoundland and Labrador to carry on and manage its obligations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261838">This money was projected by the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador based on the formulas that were existing.

              <ParaText id="1261846">Madam Speaker, the situation is very dramatic for Newfoundland and Labrador. I invite hon. members and the public of Canada to consider the fact that Newfoundland and Labrador, despite the fact that it is on the verge of have status and has reached have status depending on the price of oil, still has the highest per capita debt in all Canada. It has the highest unemployment rate in all Canada by provinces and has the lowest per capita income.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261847">In Newfoundland and Labrador the net per capita debt, as of March 31, 2008, was in excess of some $21,000, $22,000 per person. The next nearest province is at about $14,000, and that is the province of Quebec. The all province average is $10,000, so Newfoundland and Labrador's per capita debt is more than twice the all province average. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261848">With this budget, in one action behind the scenes, the government has not changed a word of the accord, but it has changed the formula for calculating payments to provinces under the offsets under the Atlantic accord by changing the equalization formula, and that results in a $3,000 per capita hit over the next three years for Newfoundland and Labrador.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261849">That is shocking, it is outrageous and it is not a Canadian budget. It is not the Canadian way to say to the newest province in Canada that this is how it will be treated by the Government of Canada. It will give us this body blow, taking away the ability of the province to continue to do the kind of things that need to be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261850">Over the last number of years, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador has been reducing its per capita debt, thanks to the oil revenues and thanks to the 2005 Atlantic accord. Two billion dollars flowed to Newfoundland and Labrador under that accord. That was used to reduce the government's obligations, the unfunded pension liability, reducing the province's per capita debt by a significant amount, bringing it down. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261851">The people of Newfoundland and Labrador have not had the kind of government measures they need. The provincial public servants had their wages frozen for two years and a very modest increase imposed on them after a strike several years ago. Nobody is flush with cash in Newfoundland and Labrador as a result of the transfer payments. The money is being used to try to reduce the provincial debt and to bring Newfoundland and Labrador services and incomes up to the national average, to fight poverty and to do the things that need to be done. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261852">Here we have a government suggesting that the proper response in the budget, which is supposed to be stimulative and recognize that people are hurting and has the means to provide stimulus and get involved in the programs and infrastructure by being able to pay its share, is saying it will cut us off. </ParaText>

He talked about changes to the equalization formula and the negative consequences they are having on Newfoundland and Labrador. We have the same problem in Quebec. The changes that were made to the equalization formula without the provinces' consent, without any negotiation, were a slap in the face to Quebec, which will lose $1 billion in equalization payments this year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261855">Under these circumstances, does the member intend to vote in favour of the Bloc Québécois' subamendment, which calls on the government to reverse its decision to change the equalization program and, among other things, maintain it in its current form? Does he intend to support our subamendment?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1261856">Madam Speaker, obviously we know that the changes in equalization announced last fall will affect a number of provinces, including the province of Quebec. It is not one that affects Newfoundland directly because this is a different problem and a different issue and has to do with specific changes to the way the formula is implemented.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261857">However, to answer directly, yes, we share the concerns of Quebec and other provinces that are losing equalization payments as a result of the unilateral action of the Government of Canada in this matter, and we have indicated our support for the proposed subamendment. Therefore, the answer is yes. We understand that this affects five or six provinces, Quebec probably being the most seriously affected. We do not want to see this happen. We want to see provinces able to respond to the opportunities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261858">Whether we support the budget or not, if the infrastructure program is going to be in place, provinces have to be able to participate in it and equalization is one of the means they have at their disposal to provide support for municipalities to get some of these projects going.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1261859">Madam Speaker, one of the more disturbing elements of the budget is the lack of attention to employment insurance. Five weeks added on if one collects is a benefit, but it does not increase the eligibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261860">I have a case in my riding where one gentleman worked for 20 years and paid into the employment insurance system. He never got it back in return, never had to use it and was happy to do so. He then changed professions and opened up his own business for the last couple of years. Then unfortunately his business collapsed like so many other small businesses in this time of need. He found another occupation, became a truck driver and worked for eight months. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261861">Now he has been laid off. Because he is considered a new employee under the employment insurance system, he is not eligible for benefits despite being eligible when he left after paying into it for 20 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261862">Does my hon. friend and colleague think these types of practices are unfair? I believe a worker, is a worker, is a worker. Whether one lives in Prince Edward Island, Ontario or British Columbia, one needs the support if one has paid into the system. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1261863">Madam Speaker, the hon. member and I share the view there are many changes in the EI system that could have been part of the budget that would provide direct stimulus by putting cash in the hands of people who are unemployed and who would spend that money. This would be stimulative in effect but also beneficial to the individuals involved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261864">In my province of Newfoundland and Labrador the fishermen's union, for example, has been calling for significant changes to the EI system, recognizing there is a $54 billion surplus historically that has been collected from workers and employers for the purposes of EI but has not been spent for that purpose. There is a historical surplus that can be directed to increase the eligibility requirements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261865">We have a situation now where less than 40% of the people who are unemployed actually get access to the employment insurance benefits. The small change that has been made is certainly helpful to those who end up being on employment insurance for a long period of time, but it does not make one single person who was not eligible before eligible now, and that is a shame. This could have been remedied easily, yet the government has failed to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261866">It is a major defect in the budget. It ought to be rethought and the government should change its policy and do something for unemployed workers. This needs to be done.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1261868">I do not know how many members of Parliament know how devastating it is to one day find out that they do not have a job, to wonder how to pay the heating bill or buy food for their families, to walk miles on the pavement looking for a job that does not exist, to think about having to move to a smaller home or low-rent apartment or perhaps go to the food bank. If that happened tonight, they should think of how devastating it would be. This was what was unfolding in November. Unfortunately, the government did not act on this crisis for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261869">The opposition parties got together and pushed back. In this wealthiest country in the world, we have to at least attempt to take action. Opposition parties should be proud of what they have achieved. The changes in the budget compared to the economic statement were like night and day. There are a lot of new initiatives and programs to assist a number of people in need. The Liberal leader put conditions on the assistance: it had to help the vulnerable, it had to create jobs for today and tomorrow, and it had to provide a plan to get rid of the deficit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261870">The NDP finance critic incorrectly suggested that there was nothing in those areas and a deeper analysis of the budget shows that not to be the case. For the vulnerable, of course, there was not everything asked for but there are EI changes. There are Canada child credit changes and improvements. There is improvement to the working income tax benefit. There are initiatives for seniors in tax, RRIFs and housing. There is housing for the disabled and money for youth. There are initiatives in forestry, manufacturing, agriculture, fisheries, the automotive sector, culture, infrastructure, home renovation, the community adjustment fund, as well as financing for business and small business tax credits. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261871">One I fought very hard for was tourism. I am delighted there is money for tourism, which for years I have been lobbying for. I have also lobbied for the government to re-establish the GST rebate for individual tourists, which was not done. I know the industry wanted a previous promise kept to reduce the excise tax on aviation fuel by 2¢ and airport rents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261872">In the area of jobs for tomorrow, there is money under broadband, skills development, IRAP, infrastructure at colleges and universities, CFI and strategic training for people both on and not on EI. Of course, there was a plan to end the deficit by 2013, although there is a problem with some of the numbers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261873">Everyone can see we in the Liberal Party pushed hard and achieved a number of new initiatives and programs. The problem is that some of these initiatives look pretty good on the surface but are a mile wide and an inch deep. There are a number of areas where the help does not go far enough and could have gone farther. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261874">As for the increase in seniors' exemption of $1,000, for instance, it gives them about 50¢ a day. Not much can be done with that. There is nothing for child care. There were suggestions on improving pay equity and with the record of the government that is a little worrying. There are strings attached to infrastructure. Some communities may not have matching funds, which could slow that going out. Of course, as has been mentioned numerous times, there were other suggestions for EI.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261875">One might ask how we would fund these when we already have a huge $85 billion deficit going toward with the things I just outlined. Some of it could have been funded by the contingency fund at $3 billion and it was embarrassing that the <Affiliation DbId="128843" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance</Affiliation> did not even know it existed. Between that and over $16 billion that the government went into deficit with before this crisis even occurred, there are $20 billion that could have been used for those initiatives had the government managed it well and kept the large surplus it inherited for emergency times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261876">People know I am normally very positive. I do not like to waste time on the negative items. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261877">Why would the Liberal Party then put the government on probation to deliver these services and programs for the vulnerable and to protect jobs? The reason is because the government has a questionable history on delivering promises. Where are the three icebreakers? That was the government's very first promise to northerners. Where are the ice strengthened supply ships? Where are the planes for Yellowknife? What about the broken promise on income trusts?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1261878">Mayors have suggested that a large number of promises have been made with respect to infrastructure but the money has not flowed yet. Members can see why we want to make sure there is reporting on this plan so that these items can actually get delivered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261879">With respect to the north, I am happy that a number of the items that I lobbied hard for are in the budget. Tourism and mining are big in the north. The auto industry and the forestry sector are important also. I am glad these were added. I have talked about tourism already and the Arctic research centres. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261880">The $90 million economic development fund, as I have stated, was running out and needed to be renewed. The formula kicks in with $185 million for transfer payments. There is $200 million for northern housing, small craft harbours for Pangnirtung and the Clyde River cultural facility, Northwest Territories harbours dredging and the Yellowknife Bypass Road.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261881">To finish my time I want to comment on items that I have received from northerners who are concerned about different issues and have some suggestions to make. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261882">One is from Jean-Paul in Whitehorse who wants a special program for the extra costs of providing wind energy in the north. Instead of that, the energy wind program was cancelled completely. People in that industry across the country are shocked.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261883">Another issue is related to aboriginal housing in the north. If members look at page 105 of the budget there is $400 million for housing on reserves in the south. There is $200 million for northern housing but it is for all northerners; $50 million for my riding. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261884">The minister from Calgary got into a lot of trouble in my riding when the money was not transferred directly to first nations but instead went through other governments. Now they want to know how much of that $50 million is for first nations governments. They are pretty upset again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261885">Brook and Dustin are worried that we will lose the vital protection of environmental assessments afforded to them under the Navigable Waters Protection Act. We will be watching that carefully for any changes and that should go under full review.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261886">We had another suggestion for more investment in electoral reform. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261887">The NWT Chamber of Commerce was happy with a number of initiatives like the Mackenzie Valley pipeline, the strategic investment fund, mineral exploration and the Arctic research facilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261888">I had a letter from David Krutko, the MLA from Mackenzie Delta, who would like $40 million from the building Canada fund for the Peel River bridge. I am not sure how that fits into the total set of NWT priorities yet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261889">I have a letter from a senior in Teslin which states: “I would like to suggest that Canada might consider the possibility of restoring the seniors capital to pre-crisis level which would allow the senior to transfer his savings into a secure and insured account preventing further financial and lifestyle loss. I'm not sure how this can be accomplished. I'll leave that to the professionals. Hopefully our elected members in Ottawa will consider this suggestion and will be able to agree on a formula to correct this heartbreaking situation”. The letter is signed by B. Cooley.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261890">Another issue which I am sure everyone in the House is onside with is the importance of inter-operability of equipment among our first responders, police and firemen and paramedics, to protect them and their victims. Public safety is doing a good job on this. Barack Obama and U.S. governors have it as a high priority. Mr. Obama spoke about it recently. One thing that would help with the good job that the government is doing is if radio infrastructure was eligible under the building Canada fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261891">I had a letter from a gentleman named David but I am not sure if it was aimed specifically at the budget. He is a crane operator who has lost his job and is not eligible for EI because of some of the regulations that are in place. David is only one of thousands of Canadians who are in the heart-wrenching situation of wondering how they can care for their families, how they can live, how they can have shelter and clothing and not have to go to food banks or the Salvation Army, and not have to move. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261892">I hope all of us in the House will work as hard as we can to implement as many things as we can considering we are the wealthiest nation on earth. We need to work together to help those Canadians in desperate need.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1261893">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to ask a question of the member for <Affiliation DbId="128784" Type="2">Yukon</Affiliation>. I know that one of the things he is very concerned about is the situation of first nation communities in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261894">This budget purports to spend about $1.4 billion in first nation communities. The Assembly of First Nations, in its prebudget submission, suggested that a $3 billion stimulus package was necessary for first nation communities. The member knows as well that the last Liberal government proposed the Kelowna accord, which proposed about $5 billion worth of spending in first nations and aboriginal communities in Canada. So we are falling far short of what the first nation communities themselves identified, what his own party identified as was necessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261895">Specifically, we see that this budget talks about $20 million over two years for partnerships to improve child and family services when the Indian and Northern Affairs Department itself says that this is underfunded by about $109 million a year. This budget only proposes $400 million for on-reserve housing, when the department again has estimated that in 2005 $5 billion was needed in housing alone to bring aboriginal housing on and off-reserve up to Canadian standards. This budget talks about $515 million for urgent infrastructure. That would only build 10 schools when 89 schools are needed across the country in first nation communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261896">I wonder, given that incredible shortfall in funding to first nations, how this member is able to support this budget.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1261897">Madam Speaker, I know the hon. member has done excellent work protecting the first nations in his area. He certainly will not get any quarrel from me that for a long time there has been insufficient funding to change the disparity between first nations and the rest of Canadians. He is absolutely correct that we put in the Kelowna accord, when those funds were available, the biggest attempt in history to reduce those discrepancies. So I, too, am very disappointed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261898">Even the items he has lobbied for, and I notice that schools for instance are in the budget to some extent, may be an improvement over what there was in the past. However, these things should have been done long ago, and more money for water systems. Could members imagine if we had not acted immediately and it were not on some distant reserve, and if our water had those types of problems? These are things for which we have constantly pushed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261899"> There are some steps in the right direction in the budget but as the member said succinctly, there needs to be much more. We will constantly, as we have in the past, push even more to reduce these disparities.</ParaText>

The member has spoken about these. He has spoken about where he would like to see changes. However, he has also spoken about the process of accountability, monitoring the accountability, and how effectively those funds would be used and those programs would be utilized.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261901">When these quarterly reports come forward, from his perspective of being able to respond on behalf of his residents and northern development, does the member see these reports being streamed into the relevant committee and then the committee recommending particular action? Is that the kind of responsive mechanism that he sees would be in the interests of regions across this country, in terms of extracting the very best of this budget, and doing the things that the budget intends to do and thereby improving it where that might be possible?</ParaText>

I think what is important is exactly what the member said. We need to know what is being spent because in the past small-town mayors have told us that they had not received any infrastructure from the building Canada fund that had been advertised year after year. So, if we have an official analysis where it is on paper, we can look at it</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1261905">Madam Speaker, in the history of a nation there are defining moments, moments that we mark with pride, moments that we mark with disillusionment, moments that fundamentally change the way we think about our country. The United States of America recently had a defining moment marked with pride and hope, a beacon for the future, the setting of a new course, a direction mapped with vision and leadership. We have not been so fortunate in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261906">It took the Conservative government too long to acknowledge the serious problems in the economy. The Conservative government took too lightly its request to close the House of Commons. Its inaction saw 100,000 Canadian jobs lost, futures made uncertain, lives disrupted, hope lost. When the Conservative government finally got down to business, catching up with the rest of the industrialized world and offering a stimulus package, while the nation waited for leadership, while a country held its breath in the hope of some positive direction, what the Conservatives did was tear apart the foundation of a federation. They sent a message that fairness does not exist, that vindictiveness outpaces vision, that bold initiatives are displaced by bad direction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261907">I listened intently to the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> deliver his budget. I listened, read, reviewed and found very deep beneath his glowing words the ugly truth of how the Conservatives treat provinces in this federation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261908">A few short weeks ago I stood in this House and spoke with pride about how it felt to be a first generation Canadian and an eighth generation Newfoundlander and Labradorian working to build a great nation. I stand today with no less passion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261909">In what is touted to be a stimulus budget, in a time when governments around the world work to ensure that the success of their countries is secure, the Conservative government attacks certain members of its federation, penalizes them, retaliates against them and cuts them to the core.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261910">Thankfully, Newfoundland and Labrador, through prudent and careful planning, is no longer receiving equalization. While the province has the highest per capita debt and many challenges to overcome, it is indeed making progress. However, this budget contains previously undisclosed changes to the equalization formula which have major impacts on the Atlantic accord.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261911">The Atlantic accord sets the rules for the sharing of revenues with Ottawa of the offshore energy industry. Let me tell the Conservative government that by unilaterally changing the O'Brien formula for equalization, and penalizing--not stimulating, but penalizing--taking money away from Newfoundland and Labrador, $1.5 billion--$400 million in 2009, $600 million in 2010 and $500 million in 2011--is reprehensible, unconscionable and difficult to swallow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261912">This is no way to build a federation. It breeds an atmosphere of mistrust that will cause problems in the future. The provinces of Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador are the targets of the Conservative government today. Who will it be tomorrow? That is the question all provincial governments have to ask themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261913">In this House we often speak of huge numbers. We talk about millions and billions of dollars in expenditures. What does $1.5 billion mean to the province of Newfoundland and Labrador? It will likely mean the province will have less funding to help in health care and education. It will mean that some of the lowest paid nurses in this country will not necessarily get the wage increases they deserve. It will mean that health care facilities may not be able to recruit health care professionals. Care to patients may suffer. It means municipalities in the province that are trying to take advantage of some of the infrastructure programs in the budget may not be able to do so because they cannot come up with matching funds to put in place the kind of infrastructure they need to provide safe drinking water for the people in small communities in Newfoundland and Labrador. </ParaText>

I would also note that I am sharing my time with our distinguished member for <Affiliation DbId="128737" Type="2">Kamloops—Thompson—Cariboo</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261946">A synchronized global recession is hitting every economy in the world. Canada, as a great trading nation, is feeling its effects. I have certainly noticed the pain in my home town of <Affiliation DbId="128457" Type="2">Barrie</Affiliation> as well. We have lost jobs in the manufacturing sector, as have many towns in Ontario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261947">It is my sincere belief that the economic action plan delivered by the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister </Affiliation>on January 27 was an appropriate and meaningful answer to the economic challenges we are facing. It is Canada's plan to stimulate our economy, to protect Canadians during this global recession and to invest in our long-term growth. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261948">Our government built this plan after one of the broadest and deepest consultation processes in Canadian history. We heard Canadians' concerns about their jobs, their savings and their families. We listened to their concerns and took their advice. Now we are taking immediate and meaningful action. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261949">We are giving more tax relief by letting Canadians earn more money before paying higher tax rates. We are building on the benefits that exist for low-income Canadians. The working income tax benefit is being increased as an added incentive for Canadians to join and remain in the workforce. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261950">I was at the Terraces seniors home in Barrie last weekend for the 90th birthday party of my friend Raymond Blackett. I was told as I left his birthday party to make sure that we did not forget seniors in the budget. I am pleased to say that the budget certainly did not. Seniors will see new support. We are increasing the age credit amount by an additional $1,000, and we are also reducing by 25% the amount Canadian seniors are required to withdraw from their registered retirement income funds for 2008.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261951">The bottom line is that this year and over the next five years, our personal income tax measures will put about $20 billion back into Canadians' hands and back into the Canadian economy to keep it moving forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261952">When I think of tax relief, I think of my grandfather. He is very much the typical resident in Barrie. I have dinner with my grandfather every Sunday. He is 92 years old. He has been working every day all his life. He gives me the same message every Sunday: “Tell those folks in Ottawa we pay too much tax”. I think his sentiment is shared by many Canadians. I am glad the budget recognizes that we need to put more funds back into Canadians' pockets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261953">Let me paint a picture of how tax relief helps the local economy. I give the example of a family in Barrie. Garry Perkins, on Crompton Drive, is a pilot in Barrie. His wife Karen is a local nurse. The Perkins family resides in the north end of Barrie. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261954">Cutting taxes means they will have more money available to support their family. I asked Garry what this tax relief would mean to him, and he gave me an example. Maybe it means he could get his son Andrew a new set of hockey equipment from Garner's, a local sports store on Dunlop Street, so by supporting local business, we are protecting a job that might have been imperilled during the slowdown. The cycle provides tremendous synergy for our economy when we put money back into the pockets of Canadians. Plain and simple, putting tax dollars back into the economy works.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261955">I was particularly encouraged by another aspect of the budget, an aspect that I think is important to note from the perspective of an Ontarian. When I looked at the breakdown of health care across the country, I noticed Ontario is getting a $139 million increase in health care transfers. Canadians coast to coast are seeing an increase as well. It is important to note that point, because the last time Canada and the world faced a significant global recession, the approach taken by the government of the day, a Liberal government, was to significantly cut health care transfers to the provinces. The pain caused by those cuts was quite dramatic. The doctor shortages we are facing today, and some of the catastrophic crunches hospitals are facing, are a direct result of the beating the health care system took during that government's attempt to hide fiscal problems by attacking the health care system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261956">This government has shown a lot of leadership by managing to continue to increase health care funds despite the economic challenges we are facing, to such an extent that the Liberal Premier of Ontario, Dalton McGuinty, actually commended the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> two days ago for the budget, which he believes is positive for the country and the province of Ontario.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1261957">I am pretty excited about that aspect of the budget. I was touring the ER ward at Royal Victoria Hospital with the head of the nurses' union, Tracey Taylor. I talked to a local nurse, Betty, from Dunsmore Lane in Barrie, and they are already working beyond capacity. It would be the wrong choice to cut health care funds at this time. I am glad this government is not repeating the dreadful mistake that occurred in the 1990s when that government made that error.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261958">Housing and renovation are important aspects of the budget to highlight. Our plan gives a shot in the arm to the home construction and home renovation industries. Both are key drivers of our economy. It allows first-time home buyers more flexibility to withdraw from RRSPs to make their purchase and gives them a break through a tax credit on their closing costs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261959">Our plan also includes a new measure to let Canadians invest in the value of their homes while putting tradespeople to work and giving a boost to businesses that make and sell building products. For the next two years, the new home renovation tax credit will apply to the costs of labour and supplies. It could save Canadians up to $1,350 when they improve their homes. This should certainly create jobs across the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261960">I look at this through the lens of the city I represent. Just two weeks ago I was touring the facility of Yanch Heating in Barrie, one of Canada's leading producers of geothermal technology. I went on the tour with company owner Chris Yanch, who told me residents are taking up this notion of geothermal, which reduces energy consumption by 75%. He said the missing link was that there was not enough incentive to make those changes, and he wished we had a budget that would provide a little more help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261961">I am very pleased to be able to call that company and say that a resident in Barrie or anywhere in Canada who wanted to install geothermal would now get $1,350 more. We are helping people become active environmental stewards of their own homes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261962">On that same note, I remember meeting in the summer with people from another company in Barrie, Dommelvalley. They produce solar panels, and they also said that they could do so much more if there were a little incentive to help Canadians make these retrofits to their homes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261963">This budget does just that. It is important, and Canadians should certainly take the government up on it and make these changes. This incentive supports local businesses, creates jobs, benefits the value of people's homes and benefits the environment, particularly if they choose some of the new technologies available.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261964">Another aspect of the budget that is particularly encouraging is the record investment in infrastructure. From 2000 to 2005, prior to my election to Parliament, I was a city councillor in Barrie. For two of those years I was the finance chair. When we were doing budget every year, I remember how constrained municipalities were with infrastructure needs that existed in Canadian municipalities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261965">A government that gets it and acts is a tremendous step forward for municipalities. Make no bones about it: this is an all-time record investment in infrastructure, and it is going to make a tremendous difference by not only creating jobs through the construction that this infrastructure will entail but also by helping and strengthening the vibrancy of municipalities in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261966">As Canadian families take steps to build infrastructure in their own homes, we are taking action to build infrastructure across the country. We know that getting shovels into the ground today will create jobs for Canadians now while providing the framework for Canadians to grow upon in the years to come. We are building and renewing municipal, provincial and territorial infrastructure, our post-secondary research and health infrastructure, and our key federal assets. This money will flow quickly, and the shovels will hit the ground quickly. We will see a smoother approval process for projects, and less bureaucracy and red tape.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261967">We are talking about infrastructure that people generally identify quickly. Barrie has several shovel-ready projects, and I see examples that could turn into job creation projects in the future, such as the Allandale train station and even Georgian College, since part of this budget allocates $2 billion for college and university infrastructure upgrades. This budget is a win on numerous fronts.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1261968">I will quickly add one last point. The fund available for rinks will be a boon for Canadian communities that could not afford outdoor or artificial ice rinks. Barrie tried a few times, but the money was not available. Now communities like Barrie will be able to have that recreation. This is a tremendous budget for Canadians. It is going to make our communities stronger and I am excited to support it.</ParaText>

In the early 1990s, when we last entertained this global slowdown, it was the decision of his party and his government to actually slash, cut and burn social programs as a means of balancing the budget. It is a bit hypocritical.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1261983">I will make some general observations about the budget and then look at some of the specific details in terms of how the measures suggested will support members of my constituency of Kamloops—Thompson—Cariboo and, indeed, all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261984">Like many I have struggled with the notion of a deficit and, with reluctance, I have come to accept that the global economic crisis requires the response of temporary short-term stimulus and extraordinary support for the financial system. It only takes a brief glimpse of the news each evening to see how profoundly other countries are being impacted. CBC did a special last night outlining the difficulties that China was facing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261985">It is with some reassurance that I note the low debt to GDP ratio that Canada enjoys relative to other countries in the G7 and the five year projection for a return to surplus. It is also important to note that for a return to surplus, the expenditures in the budget are not structural in nature.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261986">Although it is important to acknowledge the challenging economic environment and the very real difficulties workers, families and communities are experiencing, it is also important to remember that adversity creates challenges and opportunities. I am inherently optimistic about the strength and creativities of Canadians and that we will emerge from this challenge a stronger country with a solid economic foundation for the future which will include a softer footprint for this earth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261987">This budget is the result of an extraordinary consultation process with the Canadian people. I believe the end product is truly reflective of this extensive input.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261988">The term coal face was originally a mining term to describe an underground worker who cut coal from the rock. The workers would emerge at the end of the day with their faces quite blackened. This term was not meant to reflect the dirty face but respect for their direct involvement with the core of the business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261989">If we work at the coal face, we deal with the real problems and issues rather than sitting in an office discussing things in a detached way. I would argue that the budget is truly a coal face budget for Canadians, not a partisan product developed in isolation of meaningful input.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261990">It has been suggested by some that the budget is just a Christmas wish list that does not have a broad vision for Canada. The hon. <Affiliation DbId="129313" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> stated that it was a hodgepodge of measures adopted at the last minute. The hon. leader of the NDP suggested that we cobbled together the budget. I would argue exactly the opposite.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261991"> The budget contains many strategies and structures for industry and communities to move forward into their future. As the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> indicated, meeting short-term needs while serving long-term goals. Indeed, it is disrespectful to communities not to recognize that our strength lies in their local ability to innovate and create a future. It is the sum of our small and large businesses, their ingenuity that will ultimately return us to prosperity. We must temporarily support and provide the tools and funding to respond to their needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261992">My December and January, like many in the House, was spent in wide consultation throughout my constituency. This is an area with both rural and urban communities and includes six municipalities and six aboriginal bands. My consultation process included local government, business leaders, non-government organizations and the general public. Tourism, forestry, agriculture and mining are all drivers of our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261993">As these conversations progressed, it appeared there was general consensus in terms of the range of opportunities that would not only provide short-term benefit in terms of economic stimulus, but also long-term advantage, the jobs for tomorrow and the necessary infrastructure foundation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261994">The goals of an economic action plan that would help Canadians and stimulate spending, improve access to financing, take immediate action to build roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure, stimulate housing and support industry and community were widely embraced. The question then becomes: does this budget achieve those aims?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261995"> Rather than talking about the budget in terms of the billions for this program and the millions for another, I would like to talk about the real meaningful opportunities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261996"> Access to credit was a number one issue for industry, businesses and individuals.

From the merchants on Main Street, to the citizens who require the Internet for the opportunity to do home-based work, to the small health centre that would enthusiastically embrace telemedicine, broadband access was their single highest priority, and our budget will provide this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1261998">Rather than solely focusing on industries suffering from a downturn, the community adjustment fund will widely embraced to support a new future. This might include pursuing the dream of Wells Grey UNESCO designation for Clearwater, further development of the hemp manufacturing for 100 Mile House, expansion of tourism opportunities for Valemount and Blue River and enhanced back country trail development for Barrier.

              <ParaText id="1262004">Some of the budget highlights for my area would not be complete without noting the support for the aboriginal community. Skills and training to ensure readiness for opportunity, housing and partnership for health are important elements in breaking the cycle of disadvantage. It is real action on real problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262005">In my prior career as a health care professional who worked directly with many aboriginal communities, I can attest to the abysmal living conditions that too many of our first nation citizens experience. With the measures introduced this week, there is real hope for substantive change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262006">I suggest that this budget is not a hodgepodge as suggested, but a compact and multi-layered response to a very challenging economic time. As one of the pundits suggested, we cannot have everyone building robots right now. The beauty of this response is the delicate balance of supporting immediate needs without losing sight of the future.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1262018">We are here today to talk about the budget. The Bloc Québécois' subamendment is, of course, a major one. In light of the current crisis, we expected the Conservative government to take the needs expressed by the people into account. Quebec's National Assembly wanted to contribute its two cents to the budget consultations, and that is why the assembly—the Liberal Party of Quebec, the Parti Québécois and the Action Démocratique—decided to move a unanimous motion, which the Bloc Québécois has proposed in its subamendment today. This is further proof that there is only one party in this House that truly stands up for Quebeckers' interests. That party is the Bloc Québécois, and we have decided to vote against the budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262019">The motion by Quebec's National Assembly, which the Bloc has presented today, asks for help for workers, communities and businesses affected by the economic slowdown, and financial support for struggling sectors—particularly the manufacturing and forestry sectors, of course—similar to what the government decided to do for the auto sector in Ontario. The government promised Ontario no less than $4 billion in assistance, but is giving just a few million dollars to the manufacturing and forestry sectors in Quebec. That is a really big difference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262020">We also want to see improvements to the employment insurance program. The government has brought in certain measures. We are not against increasing the benefit period from 45 to 50 weeks. However, Quebec's National Assembly and Quebec as a whole want improved access to employment insurance. Today, in 2009, 53% of Quebeckers who contribute to employment insurance are not entitled to benefits. That was our basic demand with respect to employment insurance, but the government refused to discuss the issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262021">We are also talking about keeping equalization calculations the same. The fact that the government insists on changing the equalization calculations means that this year Quebec will lose close to $1 billion and could lose as much as $2 billion next year. For this reason alone we cannot vote for this budget. Obviously, Quebec's National Assembly has opposed and will continue to oppose a national securities commission. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262022">The Conservative government has made choices that favour Ontario and the west, at Quebec's expense. We understand that the government is attempting to win more seats in Ontario and western Canada in order to obtain a majority. And this budget is padded with gifts for these parts of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262023">The leader of the Bloc Québécois has reiterated his trust in me by appointing me as the agriculture critic once again. On this topic, we cannot stay silent on what the government has done and, above all, what the government has not done. The <Affiliation DbId="111568" Type="96">Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food</Affiliation> was no different from his colleagues when he revealed what was in the budget before it was read. Obviously he did not reveal the details because, as the saying goes, “the devil is in the details.” Hearing that there will be $500 million in the budget for agriculture makes people happy at first, of course. They think there will be some money to help them. But, when the details were unveiled, we all got a surprise. For those who know the Conservatives though, it really was no surprise. The member for <Affiliation DbId="128274" Type="2">Lévis—Bellechasse</Affiliation> kicked off his marketing campaign with a statement before the budget was read.

              <ParaText id="1262028">The agriculture sector was quick to react and respond to this sort of wishful thinking, because there was a real disconnect between what the minister had announced and the actual details in the budget. The title of the press release from Quebec's Union des producteurs agricoles says it all: “A budget that's way off track”. That is what the Union des producteurs agricoles had to say.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262029">“This budget is disturbingly insensitive to the agricultural community,” said Christian Lacasse, president of the UPA, in this press release. “By excluding income support measures where the need is greatest, the government is completely changing a program that was supposed to be flexible.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262030">I mentioned earlier that the member for <Affiliation DbId="128274" Type="2">Lévis—Bellechasse</Affiliation> had said that producers would have a flexible program, a good program. The government completely ignored the recommendations of Quebec's agricultural community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262031">“A program that each province can adapt to its own particular agricultural reality is obviously a good thing, but it must be properly funded and targeted,” the president of the UPA went on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262032">As for assistance for the slaughter industry—because that, too, was announced in advance—the government has overlooked Levinoff-Colbex, which is located in Saint-Cyrille-de-Wendover, in the riding of my friend from <Affiliation DbId="128277" Type="2">Drummond</Affiliation>, who is also quite familiar with this issue. It is the only major cull cattle slaughterhouse in eastern Canada. Beef producers have just recapitalized to the tune of $30 million and expect the government to apply the same rules for capitalization as for new projects: one dollar of government funding for every dollar of private investment. Consequently, $50 million over three years is not nearly enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262033">It is still not known whether Levinoff-Colbex can benefit from this program, and there have long been calls for government money and support to help this slaughterhouse survive. I would remind members that it is the only one of its size left in eastern Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262034">I would like to read another excerpt from the UPA press release:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262035">“Major financial support was also required for the forest industry, which would have needed at least double the investments announced just to keep going—”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262036">That is what the UPA had to say. A number of my colleagues in the House will cite people from various sectors who are totally dissatisfied with this budget. Two of my Bloc Québécois colleagues issued a press release today concerning women's groups that were completely overlooked by this budget. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262037">Continuing with agriculture, the Conservative government had the nerve to appropriate the names AgriFlex, or agri-flexibility, invented by the Canadian Federation of Agriculture and its partners, such as the Fédération des producteurs de cultures commerciales du Québec. The central idea behind the concept is that the viability of the family farm can only be maintained if farmers had programs in place allowing them to plan for the long term.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262038">The government did not include measures to ensure income security, the very essence of what farmers are asking for. Flexible regional funding is needed in order to ensure support for programs like Quebec's farm income stabilization insurance program, which insures farmers against catastrophic income shortfalls caused by unstable world prices, regional market conditions and other factors beyond their control. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262039">The government opted for smoke and mirrors. It has been raising expectations, of course, ever since the election campaign. While campaigning, they talked about a plan totalling $500 million over four years. But in the budget, that turned into $500 million over five years, a small difference of only a few million dollars. The bubble has burst.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262040">One thing is crystal clear: this government has abandoned Quebec; this government has abandoned Quebec farmers with this budget.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1262042">Madam Speaker, there is assistance for communities. Amounts are yet to be calculated, but the economic statement refers to per capita assistance for communities in trouble. The communities most in need are those dependent on forestry and manufacturing industries, particularly in Quebec, but also in Ontario. However, it came to light that, on a per capita basis, Alberta would receive more for every job lost than would Quebec. That is why we can say that the budget as well as the former economic statement favour western Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262043">We could also talk about tax measures and the tax cuts always given to major oil companies. The Bloc Québécois had asked that this assistance be reduced or even completely abolished. Big oil companies absolutely do not need tax cuts in these turbulent economic times. However, this government refused to touch the tax breaks given to help its friends in western Canada and its friends the oil companies.</ParaText>

            </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1262049">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to take part today in the ways and means debate, particularly as we enter into a recession. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262050">In its budget, the government announced several measures to set the economy back on the path to prosperity. In my opinion, Quebec is not getting all the benefits of these measures that the neighbouring provinces are. What is more, the Conservatives would have done well to heed the people of Quebec and the needs they expressed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262051">This budget is a long way from meeting the needs unanimously expressed by the Quebec National Assembly. Unfortunately, the leader of the Conservatives chose instead to heed the demands of Ontario and the west, to the detriment of Quebec. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262052">For example, the government is offering measures aimed mainly at Ontario, to a total of close to $4 billion. The forestry and manufacturing sectors in Quebec, on the other hand, will receive a mere few millions—a pittance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262053">While some of the measures announced in the budget might be of benefit to the industrial sector, nevertheless it is still a fact that there is no aid directly targeting the manufacturing sector in Quebec. Yet the Bloc proposed some far more generous measures within its recovery plan, measures that could have helped companies no longer making a profit because of the crisis. The government turned a deaf ear and opted for a variety of measures to reduce corporate taxes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262054">Yet everyone understands that a manufacturing or forestry company that is not recording any profit is already paying little or no taxes. So who exactly is really benefiting from these tax cuts? The answer is obvious.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262055">I would, however, like to address the economic aspect of the situation. Clearly, a recession is an economic phenomenon that requires an economic stimulus package, and a whole speech could have been devoted to that. A recession, however, is not just about business and taxation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262056">In fact, there is another aspect of the recession that I prefer to talk about: the impact on people's lives, particularly the most disadvantaged. In this connection, I note a remarkable consistency in the Conservatives: to always ignore the same categories of the disadvantaged—the most vulnerable members of our society—or to once again attack the same sectors that, according to their ideology, will not be profitable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262057">When I took part in the debates on last November's throne speech, I raised the point that there were some glaring omissions including women, people with inadequate housing, older workers, the unemployed, the cultural industry, and seniors. Once again, the same categories of people are ignored by this budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262058">I would like to focus on what is happening to seniors living below the poverty line. These seniors are among the poorest, most vulnerable members of our society. Seniors receiving the guaranteed income supplement will not be getting any more help anytime soon. The Conservatives have provided a $1,000 age-related tax credit, which is all well and good, but it will not help the poorest of our seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262059">That leads me to question this measure, because this is just like the problem with business tax credits: how is a tax credit supposed to help people who may be living below the poverty line and who pay little or no tax?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262060">The increase to $6,048 might help seniors who are working for various reasons, but we must put things in perspective. It looks like seniors could save up to $961 in taxes, depending on their income. However, this is a tax measure that individuals will notice just once a year after they file their tax returns. This is not the kind of direct assistance that people need during hard times. And that does not even account for the fact that the amount saved will vary depending on the senior's income.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262061">With respect to the poorest seniors, FADOQ, a network that protects the interests of Quebec seniors, has highlighted an important fact: seniors who have no income other than old age security and the guaranteed income supplement live below the poverty line.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262062">In Quebec alone, 500,000 people collect varying amounts through the guaranteed income supplement. That means that half a million people will not receive any direct assistance because the government is refusing to improve the guaranteed income supplement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262063">The Bloc Québécois has once again made specific requests for this budget: an incremental increase in the seniors' supplement and graduated retroactivity for those eligible for the guaranteed income supplement who were swindled by the government. Taken together, these measures would have cost $2.5 billion over two years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262064">Of course, we are still asking for automatic enrollment for seniors who are eligible for the guaranteed income supplement. This is what all seniors' advocacy groups want, and their demands cannot be ignored.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262065">I would like to say a few words about social housing, which is a critical need in my community. The Bloc Québécois said that it wanted the federal government's budget to invest $2 billion additional dollars each year for construction, renovation and conversion of affordable social housing. But the government is proposing $2 billion over two years, or half of what we requested.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1262066">Of this amount, $400 million will go towards constructing social housing for low-income seniors and $75 million will go towards construction of social housing for the disabled, which is not nearly enough in these times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262067">The budget makes no mention of social housing for the poorest families, for example, two- or three-bedroom units.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262068">In Châteauguay alone, a city in my riding, the municipal housing bureau told me that 143 households were still waiting for affordable social housing. Half of these households are made up of single mothers and the other half are seniors. And that is just one medium-sized city in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262069">The reality is that a significant number of Quebec families cannot afford to buy a house, which is the case for these 143 households that I mentioned. The lack of a true policy for constructing affordable housing remains a serious flaw in this budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262070">I will finish by saying that the Bloc Québécois and I will assume our responsibilities and will vote, without hesitation, against this unfair budget that does not respond to Quebeckers' priorities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262071">It is also clear to me that the proposed budgetary measures will help the wealthiest in our society more so than the poorest who are hard hit by this recession.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262072">Voting in favour of the budget or allowing it to pass in one way or another would be to abandon Quebec and the poor in our society, when those are two causes that I represent and defend fervently. It would go against my political beliefs and my reason for being here.</ParaText>

It did not give a long-term commitment to important institutions like the Canadian Television Fund and Telefilm Canada.

We stated then that we would ensure that total cash payments in 2009-10 are no lower than those of 2008-09. As a result of the new growth plan, the federal government and Nova Scotia agreed on a transition payment. Nova Scotia's government has accepted this agreement and has indicated its satisfaction with it. It does not affect the equalization payments of any other province. As Premier MacDonald said, “We're still receiving the $75 million. There is no clawback. We are receiving the full amount.”</ParaText>

          <Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Lobb" id="2574338">

              <Affiliation DbId="128328" Type="2">Mr. Ben Lobb (Huron—Bruce, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1262331">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House today for the first time to participate in the budget 2009 debate. I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="128282" Type="2">Edmonton—Leduc</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262332">I will begin by thanking the good constituents in Huron—Bruce for putting their faith in me on October 14 and allowing me to represent them in Ottawa. I would like to thank my family for their hard work and support and I would like to thank all of the dedicated, hard-working volunteers. Without their generosity I would not be here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262333">A synchronized, global recession is hitting every economy in the world. Canada, as a great trading nation, is feeling the effects. On January 27, the hon. <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> delivered Canada's economic action plan. This plan will stimulate the Canadian economy to protect Canadians during the global recession and to invest in our long term growth. Our government built this plan after one of the broadest and deepest consultation processes in Canadian history. We heard Canadians' concerns about their jobs, savings, families, businesses and communities. We listened to their concerns and we took their advice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262334">This government is taking action. Budget 2009 will benefit Huron—Bruce dramatically. Over the past few years, we have continued to see the economy in southern Ontario deteriorate. For example, the unemployment rate in Ontario has risen in recent months and has been above the national average for unemployment rates for two years. In spite of these realities, southern Ontario benefits from a number of economic advantages, including high education levels, large and prosperous urban centres and a close proximity to the United States marketplace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262335">However, the weakening U.S. and global economies have resulted in plant closures and slower economic growth that are creating hardships for workers and families in southern Ontario. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262336">On Tuesday, in response to Ontario's economic challenges, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> announced $1 billion for a southern Ontario development agency. This is good news for Huron—Bruce and all the ridings in southern Ontario. This agency will provide programs that support economic and community development, innovation and economic diversification with contributions to communities, businesses and non-profit organizations. It will help workers, communities and businesses in southern Ontario position themselves to take advantage of opportunities as economic growth recovers in Canada and around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262337">In addition to the regional programs, the Canadian skills and transition strategy will help to strengthen the benefits for Canadian workers, enhancing the availability of training and freezing EI rates at the lowest payroll tax in the world. This government has taken action to provide a broad range of financial support to help individuals and their families in difficult times, not only in Huron—Bruce, but across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262338">These initiatives will support Canadians in the short term as well as help them find long term job prospects with investments in training. Budget 2009 has extended the work-sharing agreement by 14 weeks to a maximum of 52 weeks, so more Canadians can continue working. In addition, for two years we will increase EI entitlement benefits by five extra weeks, increasing the maximum benefit duration to 50 weeks from the previous 45 weeks. To help workers who participate in longer term training, this government is investing $500 million over the next two years to extend EI benefits. This will help an additional 10,000 workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262339">We are doing more. This government is also investing $1 billion to enhance the availability of training delivered through EI programs over the next two years. We are also helping individuals who do not qualify for EI training, such as the self-employed or those who have been out of work for an extended period. Over the next two years, this government will invest $500 million in a strategic training and transition fund to support these individuals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262340">Since being elected in October, Huron—Bruce has experienced plant closures, layoffs and numerous people out of work. These programs will go a long way in Huron—Bruce to help our hard-working constituents retrain and get back into the workforce.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="10">(1510)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1262341">Budget 2009 also announced new measures for the agriculture industry. Farmers in Huron—Bruce continue to strive to develop innovative, high-quality food products for Canada's families and markets abroad. In turn, farmers provide a strong economic foundation for the rural communities in which they live and work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262342">The Canadian farm sector has not been isolated from the current economic downturn. The government will implement a five year, $500 million agriculture flexibility program, AgriFlex, that will facilitate the implementation of new initiatives both federally and in partnership with the provinces, territories and industry. This program will help the agriculture sector improve its competitiveness and respond to market challenges. In addition, the government will invest $50 million over three years to strengthen slaughterhouse capacity in various regions of the country to support the livestock sector. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262343">Budget 2009 also announced proposed amendments to the Farm Improvement and Marketing Cooperatives Loan Act to help make credit available to new farmers, support intergenerational farm transfers and modify eligibility criteria for agriculture co-operatives. Without a doubt, this government has taken action. This budget ensures that many of the key concerns that Canadians had are addressed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262344">In addition to the building Canada plan, this government announced an additional $7 billion in infrastructure spending. This investment will create jobs and revitalize our transportation network with repairs to our roads, bridges, highways and rail links across the country. Huron—Bruce is a good example of this investment, with $750,000 allocated for pier rehabilitation to the South Hampton Harbour. We are doing more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262345">Budget 2009 also includes tax cuts for low and middle income families. The basic personal amount of taxable income will be raised from $9,600 to $10,320 per year. This will allow Canadians to earn more before they have to start paying taxes. This government has also increased the first and second personal income tax brackets to allow earnings to be taxed at a lower rate. This will put more money back in the pockets of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262346"> We have effectively doubled the tax relief provided by the working income tax benefit to help low income Canadians over the welfare wall and into gainful employment. We have also created a home renovation tax credit that will provide incentives of up to $1,350 for Canadians to undertake new renovation projects or accelerate planned future projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262347">This budget also provides numerous investments in social and affordable housing to provide Canadians with quality housing at affordable rates. These investments will help lower income families and individuals access safe, affordable and quality housing, build a stronger future and help to create sustainable communities. We will invest $1 billion to upgrade up to 200,000 social housing units across this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262348">Budget 2009 will also invest $400 million for the construction of social housing units for low income seniors and $75 million over two years for the construction of social housing units for persons with disabilities. These investments will provide support for some of the most vulnerable in our society while providing short term stimulus relief to the Canadian economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262349">In conclusion, there is no doubt that we are taking action to address the economic crisis for all Canadians. It is only through a strong economy that Canadians can create the quality of life and standard of living to which we all aspire within the context of today's economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262350">Budget 2009 demonstrates the government's continued commitment to the economy and this country. This is the responsible federal leadership that Canadians rightfully demand and deserve. This is real action and real results for the Canadian economy.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1262351">Mr. Speaker, one of the points the member raised was the matter of freezing EI rates at the current levels. For the lay person that may sound like a good thing, because we are not going to increase them, but the fact remains that the EI fund remains operating on an annual surplus. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262352">EI rates have been going down each and every year for the last dozen years. Reducing and continuing to reduce EI rates will lower the payroll burden for companies, which pay 1.4 times the amount of the premium paid by employees, and also put more money into the hands of employees. I hope the member understands that freezing EI rates would basically hurt companies and employees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262353">There was a story on the news last night about a worker who spent 14 years with an employer. He had uninterrupted work and paid his EI premiums throughout. He switched jobs due to layoff, and there was a gap in his employment record. After some years he was laid off again, but he did not qualify for benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262354">Would the member share his views on whether that kind of employee should participate in benefits from a plan that he has paid into for so many years?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1262355">Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out to the hon. member that the <Affiliation DbId="128694" Type="4">Minister of Human Resources</Affiliation> has taken an unprecedented approach to this budget with respect to employment insurance. She consulted with numerous groups from coast to coast. She heard recommendations, and they have been implemented in the budget. I am speaking of recommendations such as a five-week extension for EI payments and tremendous benefits to people who have lost their jobs, such as dollars for retraining and dollars for self-employed people who have a child. These are the kinds of actions the government has taken. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262356">Let us also not forget the tremendous opportunity we have for retraining. It is important that people who have lost their jobs, such as colleagues I used to work with at Wescast Industries in Wingham, Ontario, be given the ability to get retrained so that they can get back into the workforce. These people are hardworking people and the backbone of this country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1262357">Mr. Speaker, I listened to the member intently when he spoke of our tremendous plan to bring Canada out of this recession quickly during this very difficult time. He mentioned some of the great things that are happening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262358">However, I would like to talk about the difficult choices we have to make. Our planning is basically the beginning of a new deal to get Canada out of this recession, but some of the choices we made go against the grain. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262359">We as a Conservative Party and a Conservative government prefer balanced budgets and modest surpluses, but during certain times deficits have to be incurred in order to get out of a particular difficult situation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262360">I ask the member to reflect on those difficult choices and to talk about them. Perhaps he could think of some other governments that had difficult choices to make. I ask the member to talk about the choices we made to maintain certain types of funding that in previous times would have been cut back. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1262365">Mr. Speaker, it is a real pleasure to rise today to address the economic action plan for Canada that was introduced by the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> on Tuesday of this week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262366">I think all members of this House can agree that these are extraordinary times in terms of the global recession in which we find ourselves. We all know that the first signs probably started with the housing crisis in the United States, but it then went on to the financial markets crisis. Around the world, financial institutions that had been in existence for decades found themselves completely insolvent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262367">The reality is that we are in unprecedented times, and unprecedented actions are required on the part of governments around the world. We have seen the United States Congress acting today in terms of their stimulus package.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262368">We have to recognize that actions taken by past governments, actions by our government and by governments of other political stripes as well, have placed Canada's financial system and fiscal situation in much better positions than is the case in other countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262369">In terms of our financial system, the IMF has recognized that our system of governing banks, the Bank Act, is certainly much better than that of our colleagues to the south.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262370">As well, although our fiscal situation in the 1980s and the 1990s--our debt-to-GDP ratio--was probably the worst in the G7, it is now the best in the G7. That improvement is a credit to successive governments, and certainly to our government for paying down $37 billion of debt in the last two and a half years. I think that is one of the Conservative government's proudest achievements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262371">However, we have to recognize that times are extraordinary, and rapid changes are going on. If members think back to the late summer and early fall, the main issue was the rise in gasoline prices, partly caused by the rise in crude oil prices. At that time of rising crude oil prices, the investment bankers in New York, some of the smartest people in the financial sector, were saying oil prices would never go below $60 a barrel. Now we have oil prices between $30 and $40 a barrel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262372">Therefore we have a very fluid situation, as the minister mentioned in his budget speech. We have to act now, but we have to realize that projections are going to be fairly fluid, and we will have to react very quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262373">We have put forward an economic action plan in terms of investing in infrastructure. People like Dale Orr have recommended that accelerating infrastructure projects, especially smaller infrastructure projects, can act as a stimulus and can act as a counterbalance in terms of the decreased spending. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262374"> As well as accelerating infrastructure projects, we are building on the gas tax transfer that was made permanent by our government. We are investing in roads, bridges, water, and waste water facilities. We are also expanding the definition of infrastructure to look at broadband and telecommunications, rather than looking at infrastructure only in the traditional sense. There is investment in people through retraining, ensuring that those who suffer unexpected jobs losses have the assistance to see them through these tough times. Unfortunately the last two months of 2008 showed a decline in the number of jobs in Canada, a trend that had not been present in the first half of 2008. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262375">In the time remaining I would like to address some of the tax policy issues, some of the changes for small businesses, and some of the things we have done for manufacturing. Then I will talk about some of the finance and credit issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262376">In terms of tax policy changes, the previous speaker mentioned some changes we have made to the basic personal exemption. We have raised that exemption, which obviously creates tax savings for all Canadians, especially those at lower income levels. The marginal rates of taxation certainly help people in the lower and middle income ranges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262377"> We are raising the level for the national child benefit supplement for low-income families, as well as the Canada child tax benefit. Those programs, which were introduced by the former government, are certainly valuable in terms of providing benefits for lower-income families with children. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262378">There is also the working income tax benefit and the increase to the age credit amount for seniors to ensure that they have the funds necessary to survive these times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262379">In terms of small businesses, we have moved the rate of taxation for small businesses from 12% to 11%. We had moved the income eligible from $300,000 to $400,000; in this economic action plan we move it up to $500,000. There is increasing access to credit for small business through proposed amendments to the Canada small business financing program and the Business Development Bank of Canada. We are providing $30 million over two years for the Canada business network, and allocating $200 million over two years to a program that I think works very well, the National Research Council's industrial research assistance program. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="25">(1525)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1262380">Small businesses across the country tell me it is a very effective program, not only at providing needed funds but also at providing mentorship and advice to smaller companies to ensure they can grow into that mid-sized level.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262381">In terms of the manufacturing sector, our industry committee did a report in February 2007. In the March 2007 budget the minister introduced a two-year manufacturing writeoff. Our committee had recommended five years. In 2007 the minister put it in place for a two-year period. In the 2008 budget he extended it for three years. It was initially at a declining rate, but in this budget he has put it so that we have the full five years. We will have it for 2010-11. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262382">We will have the full five years in terms of the two-year writeoff for manufacturers. This means they can upgrade their machinery and equipment much more quickly. They can write it off much more quickly, so not only can they become more productive, but by accessing new machinery and equipment, they can also obviously become more environmentally sustainable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262383">This is why organizations like the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters association have responded very positively to this budget and to this economic action plan. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262384">Financing and credit is the other issue they raise, and they raise it very strongly, as did other small business organizations. I want to thank these organizations, industries and businesses across Canada for raising this issue, because if companies do not have access to credit, they will simply not be able to survive or exist. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262385">In response we have established the extraordinary financing framework, which provides up to $200 billion to improve access to financing for Canadian households and businesses. It commits an additional $50 billion to the insured mortgage purchase program, increasing the overall size of this program to $125 billion. Lenders will be provided with stable, long-term financing, allowing them to continue lending to Canadian consumers and businesses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262386">The extraordinary financing framework delivers $13 billion in additional financing by increasing the flexibility and capacities of the financial crown corporations, CMHC, Export Development Canada and BDC. This includes at least $5 billion in new financing that will be delivered through enhanced cooperation between these financial crown corporations and private sector financial institutions under the new business credit availability program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262387">We have created the Canadian secured credit facility, with up to $12 billion to support financing of vehicles and equipment for consumers and businesses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262388">We have extended the deadline for issuing guaranteed instruments under the Canadian lenders assurance facility, which helps ensure that lenders are not put at a competitive disadvantage when raising funds in global markets. This was agreed to at the G20 meeting, and our government has certainly acted upon it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262389">We have established a new Canadian life insurance assurers facility to guarantee wholesale term borrowings for life insurers, modelled on the Canadian lenders assurance facility. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262390">We have facilitated the provision of extraordinary liquidity to financial institutions by the Bank of Canada, as required, through the modernization of the Bank's authorities in Budget 2008. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262391">I should note that the Governor of the Bank of Canada has certainly acted to complement the actions of our government. We have certainly introduced a plan for fiscal stimulus, but the Governor of the Bank of Canada has been very proactive in terms of trying to combat this recession through monetary policy. If we have learned anything from the mistakes of the past, from the Great Depression of 1929 and the 1930s, it was that monetary policy must not be tightened. The supply of money cannot be tightened when a recession period is entered. The governor has acted to lower interest rates to try to ensure that money is available through the system. He has also acted in terms of trying to provide as much confidence to the markets as possible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262392">We have also added a ten-year maturity to the Canada mortgage bond program to raise supplementary funding for financial institutions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262393">I know these measures sound very technical, but they are designed to ensure that money flows through the financial markets to companies so that they can pay their workers, and flows to individuals so that they can continue to borrow for mortgages, for car loans and for their needs. These measures are to ensure that the system continues to work as it should. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262394">As a government, we have acted in this area. Our actions have certainly been warmly received by the Chamber of Commerce, by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters association, and by other organizations that see the need for businesses to continue to operate because we have this supply of money going through the system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262395"> I look forward to questions from my colleagues.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1262400">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question because it is a very serious one. In fact it has been an area in which our government has acted. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262401">If the hon. member looks at the budget, it provides $170 million over two years for the forestry industry to cope with the tough times. The forestry industry will be very open in saying that it has a perfect storm in terms of the decline of housing starts in the U.S. It is a perfect storm for the industry, coping with the changing dollar volatility over the last number of years. We have acted by providing $170 million over two years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262402">The capital depreciation, the rate at which we can write off capital, was one of the strongest requests of the forestry industry in the last five years. That has been put in place, that five year term for a two year write off for equipment. The forestry industry has asked for that and we have acted upon it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262403">If the hon. member does not want to take my word for it, I will quote the Forest Products Association of Canada directly. </ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The government has clearly heard the message and embraced our vision of becoming the producers of the best quality, most innovative and greenest forest products in the world. And it understands that in order to get there Canada needs to attract investment and secure the jobs of nearly 300,000 skilled Canadians forest workers and the communities they work in.</QuotePara>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1262416">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to the budget on behalf of my constituents of Brampton--Springdale, a budget which impacts seniors, families, children, women and men not only in my own constituency of Brampton--Springdale but all of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262417">In a time of growing economic crisis, many Bramptonians, like many other Canadians across the country, are suffering. They have been hit with the loss of their jobs either in the manufacturing or the auto sector, in the retail sector or at assembly plants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262418">If we take a look at my riding of Brampton--Springdale, the Chrysler plant has eliminated its third shift, the loss of 1,100 jobs. Eleven hundred families were impacted overnight. The Simmons factory has closed, with hundreds of other Bramptonians losing their jobs. ABC plastics has closed, and the list goes on and on when it comes to people losing their jobs and companies closing their doors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262419">The result of these people losing their jobs as companies close their doors is that thousands of families out there are struggling to make ends meet, whether it is that single mother worrying about how she will put food on the table for her children, or that father wondering how he will care for his family, or that family struggling to find a child care space, or those seniors having to make that very difficult choice of either filling up the medicine cabinet or their gas tank or their fridge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262420">We have known in the last month alone that over 100,000 Canadians have lost their jobs. I only have to go to an email that I received a short while ago in my office, which states:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262421">“I have never written to any politician before but I write to you today out of desperation. After working for 22 years at a company I was told last week I was being let go. I have never known another job other than the company I worked for. I thought, when I was let go and the company was closing its doors, I would be able to apply for EI. I have just learned the wait period is for two weeks and then there is a massive backlog of another three weeks. Now almost four weeks later, I am without pay and I really don't know where to turn. I actually don't know where I'm going to be buying the next carton of milk for my baby. I know as I write to you I won't be able to get any money from you for the food that I so desperately need, but I am asking you to please tell your colleagues, your fellow MPs, that there are so many people out there like myself who were employed for years and years at one company and have been let go. All of us are looking for hope. We are looking for hope for a brighter future and a better tomorrow”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262422">Then there is the story of Mr. Beharry and Mr. Smalla, my constituents who came in to see me a few hours after they were informed that their company, ABC plastics, was closing its doors. They had been laid off. As I sat with both of these individuals, I learned that they had worked as well for almost two decades at the same company. They were left on that day without any direction or resources as to how they would go on to rebuild their lives. As fathers, they were concerned about how they would feed their children, and as husbands, how they would support their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262423">The story of Mr. Beharry and Mr. Smalla is like the stories of many other Bramptonians and many other Canadians across the country who are struggling. It is these Canadians, these Bramptonians like Mr. Beharry and Mr. Smalla, who were looking to this budget, who were looking to the government of the day for the leadership, for some action and really for a sense of hope for a better tomorrow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262424">As time has gone on, we have seen that the Conservative government of the day mismanaged the economy. The result is absolutely no leadership and then no action plan to help those people who are so desperately struggling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262425">We look once again at the area of Peel, where the issue of poverty and the gap between those who are rich and those who are poor continues to increase. We look at the issue of social housing in my riding, which has a wait list of more than 13,000 individuals, more than 30,000 people. The wait time to get into a housing unit is 21 years. It is these people on that wait list who were looking to the Conservative government and this budget for a sense of hope for a better future and a brighter tomorrow. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1262426">Let us take a look at the number of people who are accessing emergency shelters. In 2006 over 11,776 people accessed the emergency shelter in Peel. The region provided a total of 111,812 bed nights to those poor people, to those residents who are so incredibly desperate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262427">Unfortunately, the budget has delivered absolutely nothing for affordable housing and homelessness. We thought, and many of us hoped, that the budget would provide for a national housing strategy. There is absolutely nothing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262428">Canadians had seen, through previous Liberal governments, eight consecutive balanced budgets. Canadians were given a sense of hope with having one of the best economic records in the G8 and one of the highest employment rates and the lowest unemployment rates.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262429">As my colleague so eloquently described it, as the tsunami hit the global financial markets throughout the world, many of the other G8 countries acted. They acted on behalf of their citizens and on behalf of their nations to provide stimulus packages. What did we have in Canada? We had the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of the day denying there was an economic recession. We had the Prime Minister and the Conservative government denying there was the possibility of a growing crisis. We had thousands of people losing their jobs, having the door shut in their faces. We had seniors struggling to make ends meet, to pay their energy bills and their mortgage payments. They received absolutely no hope from the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262430">The government told us there would be surpluses. A few months later, when the budget came out the other day, we all learned Canadians would be inheriting an $84 billion deficit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262431"> Then the government promised a stimulus to help create jobs with infrastructure spending. One only had to read the fine print. Mayors across the country got ready because they heard about possible infrastructure spending. They presented their wish lists of shovel-ready projects, wish lists that were presented by municipalities and cities like Brampton which had a wish list that included the Trinity Common Terminal refurbishment project and the AcceleRide bus rapid transit projects. However, when they read the fine print, even though cities like Brampton have a wish list, which have been included in the city's 2009 budget, in order to access the infrastructure spending provided in the budget they must come up with the money. Many of these municipalities do not have the money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262432">We realize that the list submitted by the Brampton municipality would create an extra 21,000 jobs, jobs that are so desperately needed by many of my constituents. I hope the government will look at an action plan to ensure it provides the support to municipalities that do not have the opportunity to give some of the funding. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262433">Before I go forward, Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="128753" Type="2">Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262434">Let us look at some of the initiatives that were left out of the budget. When constituents lose their jobs, they look to EI for hope. However, the budget does not provide increased accessibility to EI. There will be no reduction in the wait time before an individual can receive EI benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262435">Those people were looking to this budget for hope. Unfortunately, they did not receive it. This is why our leader and my Liberal colleagues have put the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the government on probation to ensure that there is accountability, to ensure the funds that have been promised do not just look great as words on paper but are delivered to the municipalities and to the people who so desperately need them. Canadians across the country and constituents like mine in Brampton are looking to government. They are looking to all parliamentarians, regardless of their political stripe, to put aside their partisanship. They are looking to us for hope. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="45">(1545)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1262436">I think by working together in a spirit of cooperation, in a spirit of collaboration, we have an opportunity to give those people, who are struggling to make ends meet, the hope that they so desperately need for a brighter future and a better tomorrow.</ParaText>

What she of course does not understand is that her party only has a certain number of seats in the House and it is quite presumptuous of her and her party to suggest that they are putting government on probation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262438">In fact, it is the Canadian people, through an election, who either put us on probation, or give us approval.

              <ParaText id="1262451">Investing in children is going to ensure the success of the future of our country.

              <ParaText id="1262453">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak today to this extremely important issue. I am going to give a bit of background but also offer some solutions that I hope will find some favour on the other side.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262454">We know of the economic tsunami that has gone across the globe, one that has destroyed savings in our country and caused the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs. We know it is in part a result of improper financial regulation and oversight not only here at home but internationally. I hope the government will provide some solutions and tell us and the rest of Canada what it is going to do to make sure that in our country we will have the sensible oversight and regulations to ensure we have a competent and effective financial system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262455">What I would also like to know is what it is going to do to work with our international partners to make sure we are going to have the global financial oversight and regulation, not excessive, not one that is going to destroy the markets but one to ensure that capitalism is going to work in an effective way for the good of people. It is extremely important. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262456">It may want to consider using our folks at the IMF. I know the Clerk of the Privy Council was our representative at the IMF. He would be an excellent person to make sure that this is moved forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262457">What we saw with the government and what happened before this crisis was, unfortunately, an absence of vision and imagination, an absence of implementing the effective solutions that could have in part insulated our country against the problems we see: the reduction of the GST, boutique tax cuts, an inability to look out into the future and make the investments in people, training and sensible tax reductions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262458">Those solutions, with prudent management of the public's finances, would have been much smarter in order to ensure we are going to have as much insulation on the situation we see before us today. That did not happen. The GST cuts in and of themselves cost the taxpayer $14 billion in lost revenues to the government coffers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262459">When we look back in history and compare Liberals to Conservatives and Democrats to Republicans, what we find, ironically, and most do not know this, is that Liberals and Democrats actually have a better history of managing the public purse than Republicans and Conservatives. It is ironic, but it is true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262460">Where do go from here? There are some good things in the budget to be sure, but these solutions will help us to have better solutions in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262461">The first thing is to pursue domestic and international changes. Second, let us make sure we put more money in the hands of those who need it the most. For example, EI reform is tentative. Imagine people who own homes, are part of the 70% of Canadians ineligible for EI and they lose their jobs. Those people are feeling pain. I would implore the government to work with the Liberal Party to change the EI system to make sure that more people are eligible, the benefits are better, people have better access to training, and are not deprived of benefits while they access training. That will enable them to take advantage of the economy of the future. If we do that, we will hit those who are hurting at this point in time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262462">Now to the issue of people's pensions. The pensions of those who have worked for companies and lost their jobs have vaporized along with their jobs. These people are living with grave uncertainty. My colleague spoke quite eloquently about people who cannot afford food, medications or rent to put a roof over their heads. This is going to cause catastrophic social changes in our country. We must work together to deal with those problems and prevent those things from happening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262463">Another solution is RRSPs to RRIFs. Please change that. There could be a two-year abeyance so that people do not have to move their RRSPs into RRIFs. Right now when the market is down, people are hurting significantly.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1262464">Credit was a very smart thing the government did but people and businesses have to be able to access that credit. We can make sure that the credit goes to those companies and developments which are halfway through. That would result in equity and minimal risk to the taxpayer and it will give money to enable those developments that already are half through to move forward. People will get back to work and feeder industries into them will be stimulated, adding to the needed confidence that we must have in our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262465">Regarding infrastructure, please rectify the problem that my colleague from Vancouver brought forth today. We have to enable the infrastructure monies to get to the developments that are proposed from our municipalities and provincial governments and do them very quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262466">In my riding, the E&amp;N Railway needs to be retrofitted. We need to put special buses with wheels that run on a track between Victoria and the West Shore. We can also invest in the Spencer Road exchange. A $14 million investment would translate into a $1.4 billion stimulus package with jobs and other businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262467">For the Vancouver Island tech parks, there are 28 technological parks in our country. They are huge generators of high paying jobs and have a great multiplier effect. For example, in my community, for the Vancouver Island tech park a $30 million investment right now will transform into $700 million. All tech parks are oversubscribed to, so this would have a massive, positive leveraging effect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262468">Money for the Pacific Sport Institute would be a wise investment on the part of the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262469">Phil Fontaine, the National Chief of the AFN, has put forth a very intelligent series of solutions to help first nations communities. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the relative ministers have remarked on the challenges of jobs, housing and social infrastructure in these communities. Now is the time to invest and work with the AFN, work with local chiefs, work with these communities to enable them to finally be able to have the economic drivers within their communities to enable people to have the social benefits and social environment they yearn to have, social environments that have far less than the rest of us enjoy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262470">The issue of child care is a huge positive driver. The number of people who cannot access child care is legion. The absence of child care is something that is costing us as a country immeasurably. If the government would work with communities to enable this to happen it would be an enormous positive factor in terms of our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262471">In my riding the Canadian Forces base has at least 100 children right now waiting to receive day care. The program in Quebec is one that we may want to consider, particularly the Bagotville model on the forces base there which is an excellent one for our Canadian Forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262472">The environmental issue is a very precarious situation with respect to global warming. We now have feedback mechanisms. As the globe warms, the absorptive capacity of our oceans declines which means that the temperature goes up. As the temperature goes up, the permafrost melts. What is in the permafrost? Methane, which has a warming capability that is 25 times greater than that of carbon dioxide. Once the permafrost starts to melt, the methane is liberated which is a vicious cycle. Once we get into the feedback loop, there is actually no stopping it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262473">I would implore the government to adopt some of the intelligent environmental tools that are used in other countries from the continents of Europe and Asia, for example. We have technological capabilities now that simple retrofits, and the government can modify its retrofit program to focus on this, would enable our buildings to use 70% to 100% less of the energy needs that they actually consume. It would be intelligent, smart and effective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262474">Some people say we should not use nuclear power, but we know we are trying to balance out risk. What is more, we have to ask ourselves the question: What is more dangerous to our planet? Is it more dangerous to have nuclear power plants that reduce our consumption of coal? Or is it better to have coal power plants? The tiny risk that nuclear power plants pose is, I would argue, negligible compared to the much larger risk that global warming poses to all of us.</ParaText>

The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has voiced his concern, as we all have, over those countries. It has been a barrier for him to say that he will support initiatives that would reduce the production of greenhouse gases. We have an opportunity to engage with India and China on the issue of safe nuclear power that would reduce the consumption of fossil fuels.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1262479">In particular I would reference a discussion on the GST cuts. I have talked to people like Danny and Kumar, small business owners in Ballantrae, who said that the GST cuts had helped stimulate their business and helped keep people coming in.

              <ParaText id="1262484">Similarly, people say that the personal savings account that the government has put forward is a good thing. It is a good thing if an individual makes more than $80,000 a year because that is the kind of money someone needs to take advantage of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262485">As the member said, people are having a difficult time right now. There is a lot of debt and a lot of uncertainty. People cannot pay their mortgages. We need to get the money to the people who need it the most, which is why we are in favour of getting money into the hands of those who have lost their jobs in terms of the two year change to the EI program. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262486">The member is right in terms of reducing the tax burden on those who are poor and those in the low middle class because they will use it for their basic needs.

              <ParaText id="1262519">This is an excellent action plan developed by our government. Over the next five years we are providing $4.5 billion in Alberta for new infrastructure spending to build roads, bridges and waste water treatment plants. These programs have a far wider implication in that they will require other supports, such as engineering and design.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262520">What does this really mean? It means jobs. It means Canadians, and in particular, individuals in my riding will be working and paying taxes and contributing to the local economy as well as nationally.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1262523"> We are helping Canadians who are out of work find new good jobs. We have increased our investment in skills development and will provide opportunities for short- and long-term skills upgrading, including targeted programs for apprentices and older workers. We will also provide support for workers who do not qualify for EI benefits. We are broadening programs to help workers get back into the market. There are plans for a new major summer youth job initiative. The details will be announced shortly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262524">I am very pleased our government is providing immediate tax relief that will help all Canadians weather this difficult economic time. In Alberta this reduction of taxes by $1.5 billion will increase the basic personal amount and upper limits of the two lowest personal income tax brackets and will also increase the amounts that families can earn and still receive the national child benefit supplement and the Canada child tax benefit, providing up to $436 for a family with two children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262525">To help seniors cope, the economic statement proposes a one-time change that would allow RRIF holders to reduce their required minimum withdrawal by 25% for the 2008 tax year.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1262528">I have only touched on a few of the items in our plan. This economic action plan is good for my constituency and for people across the country from coast to coast to coast. It helps Canadians who are out of work. It protects Canadian jobs and businesses and builds up our communities. It puts more money into the hands of Canadian families. It is truly a generous and comprehensive national plan and one that is in keeping with Canada's commitment to fulfill the G7 plan of action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262529">Remember, this economic action plan provides temporary and effective economic stimulus to help Canadian families and businesses deal with short-term challenges and to build long-term capacity so we can emerge from this economic challenge even stronger.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1262531">I have been here for 15 years and time and time again the Conservatives continue to parrot certain lines which do not reflect reality. The member said, and I quote, “We recognized what was on the horizon in 2007 with regard to this economic action plan”. The reality is that we have infrastructure spending that was approved and allocated but never streamed out in the current fiscal year and will not be. There are programs which will now lapse, such as the Centre of Excellence for Women's Health, the Centres of Excellence for Children's Well-being, the Health Council of Canada, the Canadian Council on Learning, and the $750,000 of core funding for the Canada Council on Social Development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262532">The reason the Conservatives do not put out any more money on infrastructure in the current fiscal year, which does not end until March 31, is that it is bad and they do not want to show a deficit any worse than it already is going to be in the current fiscal year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262533">On top of that, when we look at the economic statement that was made last November, it showed that we would have a surplus for the current fiscal year and for each of the next five fiscal years, and it did not reflect an acknowledgement of what was coming down the pike that the member suggests was done in 2007. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1262543">Mr. Speaker, two days ago, we members of Parliament gathered to hear the historic economic action plan for Canadians. This plan is not only what Canadian federalists were hoping for, it is also a plan that provides hope for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262544">Our nation is suffering the effects of a global recession. We are a trading people who could not escape unscathed, though we still enjoy the most stable economy in the G7. I would like to address the values that animate this plan, touch on some national implications, and relate how the plan affects people on a local level in areas that are most meaningful to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262545">By background, I have spent much of my professional life in the Pacific Rim in roles as lawyer, businessman, and in an unofficial capacity, as diplomat. I have seen the great benefits that come from building bridges between people of different languages, cultures and communities. The plan itself, about which we have heard in this chamber, builds bridges between people of different languages, cultures and communities. It is a plan that unifies Canadians and gives us hope.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262546">I add my congratulations to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and the many other MPs who engaged the Canadian public in the most extensive and inclusive consultation process in budget history. At the national level, it has been documented that our Canadian government interacted with Canadians on more than 10,000 occasions, including direct consultations and opinions submitted by email and mail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262547">Like many colleagues here, I followed the lead of our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and actively sought out constituents' opinions on the budget. In my riding, I met or spoke with all twelve local government leaders, three first nations chiefs and the MLAs, and dialogued with hundreds of other constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262548"> The meeting that most vividly illustrated the approach of the Conservative government was the town hall meeting convened by the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> himself, who attracted 480 people to a meeting in West Vancouver's Park Royal Shopping Mall, where he stood among some of the retail stores hardest hit by the economic downturn. This event provided constituents the opportunity to present their ideas directly to the minister and about 50 people made it to the microphones. Canadians of every imaginable background and political persuasion were present at the meeting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262549"> My riding is known for its vast diversity. It is an almost perfect split between rural and urban. Far-flung geographically, it is the fourth largest in the country and takes ten hours and two ferry rides to travel from North Vancouver in the south to Powell River in the north. The upscale condominiums of West Vancouver contrast with the beleaguered pulp mills of Gibsons and Powell River. Significant numbers of people hail from Persian, Iranian, Chinese, Korean and Punjabi backgrounds. Three first nations are included in our riding: the Squamish, Sechelt and Sliammon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262550">Given that vast diversity, one might have expected an incoherent array of requests to have emerged from our extensive prebudget consultations, but surprisingly, what we found was a consistency among Canadians. National traits of prudence and discipline, hard work and planning for the future kept coming to the fore. People generally wanted to see immediate fiscal stimulus. Local leaders outlined their needs for improvement to water systems, sewer systems, roads, bridges and harbours. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262551">People like Eric in Powell River wanted relief from setbacks in the forest sector. David, former head of the Whistler Chamber of Commerce, sought a lift in the tourism sector. Most of all, people wanted their politicians to serve them, not to get in the way, but to provide a non-partisan answer to their economic needs and their growing sense of anxiety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262552">What unites us is more important than what divides us. Canadians are committed to working together to face the challenges ahead. The economic action plan provided people in my riding with what they were asking for. It provided practical economic stimulus and hope. The hard work, dedication, generosity and resilience of Canadians will take care of the rest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262553">Our government is committed to acting in the best interests of the Canadian economy, even if it means running a short-term deficit. Our government's plan of action provides effective economic stimulus to help Canadian families and businesses deal with short-term challenges. As well, there are measures to encourage private spending; new investments in roads, bridges, water systems and sewer systems; measures to protect the stability of Canada's financial system and ensure access to credit for business and consumers; hope and support for industries in difficulty, including forestry, manufacturing, tourism, agriculture and automotive; new jobs; and measures to protect the vulnerable, including the unemployed, lower income Canadians, seniors and aboriginal people.</ParaText>

Table A5.2 has a chart that shows the total income of individuals from $10,000 up to $150,000 and calculates what the total tax relief will be in 2009.

There is something fantastical about what happens in this place, unfortunately not in the sense that the deliberations here are fantastic but, rather, that often they appear based in fantasy.

              <ParaText id="1262588">Since last fall, when our country was first flung into the greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression, Canadians had been singularly focused on staving off threats to their jobs, pensions and savings. It was the economic crisis and the government's cavalier response to the fears of Canadians in its fall fiscal update that precipitated the political crisis of confidence and ultimately the constitutional crisis that shut down this place for two months. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1262601">I could not agree more. The 2009 budget is deeply flawed. My constituents deserve better and I cannot support it. I assume that the MP who offered the scathing critique of the budget would join me in voting it down. But, wait, I almost forgot, this is Disney on the Rideau.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262602">The member of Parliament who I quoted actually concludes by saying that he will support the budget. The member was none other than the member for <Affiliation DbId="128315" Type="2">Etobicoke—Lakeshore</Affiliation>, the new leader of the Liberal Party. Fantastical, indeed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262603">I know it is foolish to even attempt to find reason in fantasy, but the only plausible reason for this leap in logic is that the <Affiliation DbId="129313" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>, like the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, has given in to the temptation of making it all about him. Shamefully, he has made it about his job, about his opportunity to build his profile as the new leader, about his party's need to rebuild its finances instead of accepting what ought to be his sole responsibility, which is to make it all about the jobs and finances of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262604">If that is the criterion, this budget fails Canadians. It fails workers, it fails the unemployed, it fails the manufacturing sector, it fails cities, it fails the environment, it fails seniors, it fails women, it fails students and it fails the poor. On all counts, the budget should fail to get the confidence of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262605">Let us look at jobs first. Every senior economist in the country agrees that investments in public infrastructure are key to any strategy that is designed to provide economic stimulus. Don Drummond, senior vice-president and chief economist of the TD Bank Financial Group, was even more categorical. He said that cuts to the GST and income taxes were precisely the wrong way to go. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262606">Instead, the government should have invested in a major stimulus package. That package needed to include accelerated existing infrastructure funding and substantial new investments, including municipal and interprovincial projects, such as transit, clean energy, water, corridors and gateways. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1262607">It needed to include housing construction and retrofitting. It needed to include investments in key sector strategies like manufacturing, auto and forestry, designed to create and save jobs, with any aid contingent on a plan to transform these industries and return them to profitability and sustainability. While some of these words are found in the 2009 federal budget, the rhetoric does not match real investments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262608">Investments in infrastructure are far too modest and have too many strings attached. As a result, the impact on job creation will be minimal. P3s persist. There is no link between public investments and a made in Canada procurement policy. The program expires at the end of 2010, long before the jobs crisis will be over. Almost nothing in the budget addresses our environmental and climate change goals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262609">In short, the budget fails to safeguard today's jobs and fails to create the jobs of tomorrow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262610">Let me just give a concrete example of how the structuring of the infrastructure funding impacts my home town of Hamilton.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262611">I had the privilege of attending a meeting with elected officials from all levels of government about the progress being made on the remedial action plan to clean up our bay. Environment Canada has identified it as one of the areas of concern in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262612">Our community has made great strides. Fish and wildlife goals are being met, public access has been greatly enhanced, and even the toxic contamination is being addressed through the Randle Reef sediment remediation project.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262613">The last area requiring urgent action is related to water quality. The City of Hamilton urgently needs a new waste water treatment plan. The project is shovel ready. It could create up to 2,200 jobs locally and regionally. It is good for jobs, good for our city, and good for the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262614">But for Hamilton to access the infrastructure money announced in this budget, our city would need to match the federal government's funding. Our mayor has been clear. He said: “We don't have the money...I don't know how we'd find the money other than going back to the taxpayers, which I don't think is affordable either at this economic point in time”. He is absolutely right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262615">A budget that is purporting to want to help the middle class cannot ask that municipal projects be added to the property taxes of homeowners. The infrastructure funding has to be unconditional so that money can flow now for shovel ready projects. It is good for jobs, good for the local economy, good for our city, and in this case good for the environment. Yet it is not supported in this year's federal budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262616">If the budget is not saving or creating jobs, does it at least protect those Canadians who are losing their jobs? In this economic downturn, hard-working Canadians were counting on EI reform to be the centrepiece of the budget. EI directly assists the victims of the recession and it is an effective form of economic stimulus because the unemployed will spend rather than save and support their local economies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262617">But again, the budget falls short of investing in what should be one of the most effective poverty prevention programs in this country. Yes, it added five weeks of eligibility to all claims but only for the next two years. If one is not eligible for EI in the first place, this change does not help at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262618">The budget should have improved eligibility requirements, enhanced weekly benefits, and removed the unconscionable two week waiting period before unemployed workers can receive benefits. Rent and mortgage payments cannot wait two weeks, and those who have lost their jobs should not have to wait either.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262619">Speaking of waiting, seniors by definition do not have a lifetime to wait for help from their government either. Those who had private retirement savings saw their investments hammered in October's stock market collapse. They do not have the opportunity to make up for those losses with future earnings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262620">The public pension system is not enough to allow any senior to make ends meet, and yet there were no improvements to old age security, no enhanced GIS, no strong action to shore up workplace pension plans. There is nothing to ensure that the very people who built this country would be able to live out their retirement with dignity and respect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262621">Furthermore, there are no new investments in health care, and in fact, nothing to enhance any public services at this critical time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262622">What about women? They are not even mentioned in this budget. There is not a single mention of women in the entire document and no funding for issues that directly affect them. There are no new child care spaces, no increased access to EI, and no reversal on the callous attack on pay equity that was included in the fall economic update. The much touted tax cuts in the budget will offer little or no benefit to the poorest 68% of women. This budget has failed women and their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262623">I know my time is almost up, so let me just conclude by saying this to the government. As MPs we live financially privileged lives, but it is not about us. We should get rid of the broadbased tax cuts that give each of us $1,000 and give the money to those who have no paycheque at all. We should get rid of the tax credit that allows us to build decks on our cottages, and give the money to those who cannot afford a home at all. For God's sake, we should get rid of our preoccupation with our own jobs and focus on the jobs of Canadians. That is what we were sent here to do. We cannot fail our constituents just when they need us most.</ParaText>

Every single important piece that people in the community were looking for is mentioned. However, as I pointed out in my speech, it is not about saying “We will invest in social housing”. The government's responsibility is to make the money flow so that social housing would actually be created.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262629">If we are asking municipalities to pony up a third of the money that is required for the infrastructure programs that are mentioned in this budget, none of that will be built. What communities need is real investment. They need dollars to flow. Yes, we need more housing. Absolutely. We need infrastructure projects. There is absolutely no question about whether bridges in this country and roads in this country are in states of disrepair. As I said, there is no doubt that Hamilton needs a new waste water treatment plant. That is not in question. But we need more than rhetoric. We need real action. We need real dollars. We need the money to flow, or none of the rhetoric will help any Canadian or any Canadian city.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1262638">Mr. Speaker, this budget is a missed opportunity to help our economy recover and help Canadian families make ends meet during this increasingly deep and painful recession. As such, I will be opposing this fiscally and socially irresponsible budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262639">The Conservative-Liberal budget for the 2009-10 fiscal year pushes ahead with a treasury-draining $60 billion in corporate tax cuts that can only go into the well-lined pockets of shareholders of the most profitable Canadian companies. While shovelling money into pockets of the wealthiest companies and shareholders, this Conservative-Liberal budget also ensures that ordinary Canadians will continue to suffer throughout this long and painful crisis. The appalling $84 billion deficit will ensure that the children of ordinary Canadians also suffer unjustly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262640">The government continues to sit and collect interest on the $54 billion surplus in the employment insurance fund and offers no help to the 73% of workers who pay into this fund but are unable to draw from it once they lose their jobs. Even more appalling is that making employment insurance more accessible to those neglected 73% of Canadians and their families would not have added even a single dollar to the massive deficit in this budget. It would have come from the $54 billion stand-alone fund that sits untouched.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262641">To those Canadians who need access to employment insurance funds but are denied, I say that Canada's New Democrats are here, standing with you in spirit in this House, to oppose this budget and the social injustice that it perpetuates and in many cases intensifies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262642">On the issue of forestry, this government has the nerve and arrogance to table a budget that contains $60 billion for permanent corporate tax cuts and just $170 million for the struggling forestry sector that provides employment to nearly one million Canadians and which has been in its own recession for more than five years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262643">Thought of another way, this Conservative-Liberal budget provides just $170 million to help struggling forestry families get through this crisis while handing out $60 billion to the well off shareholders of Canada's most profitable corporations. It is as if the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> thinks the people of our northern communities and forestry towns simply do not exist. We do exist and we are proud to stand here today in opposition to this budget. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262644">Contrary to what this Conservative-Liberal government thinks, and indeed contrary to what the Premier of Ontario thinks, forestry is not a sunset industry. New Democrats have come to expect the sort of cold-hearted and irresponsible policy that is contained in this budget from the current government. After all, it is the one who destroyed the fiscal capacity of the Government of Ontario before moving on like locusts to destroy the once robust fields of our federal treasury.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262645">The government can do so in this budget only if it is enabled by the official opposition. Sadly, it would appear that this will be the case and I dare say the federal treasury will never be the same. Each and every member of the official opposition that stands in support of this budget should hang their heads in shame for the fact that they have turned their backs on the most vulnerable Canadians they said they would protect just 72 short hours ago. I will leave it to them to explain to their constituents why they think the current government is better suited to deal with this crisis than they.</ParaText>

There is no extension of VIA rail service to Thunder Bay and rural communities, just more trains between Canada's two largest urban municipalities. There is no mention of shipbuilding at our facilities in Thunder Bay.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1262647">The money in the budget for first nations infrastructure and health is welcome but it is not adequate. There is next to nothing in this budget that will improve rural access to family doctors, physiotherapists and mental health and emergency care facilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262648">There is a significant amount of money allotted for the upgrading of border facilities in British Columbia and southern and eastern Ontario but apparently no money for upgrading the Rainy River, Fort Frances and Pigeon River crossings, the three international border crossings that are in my riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262649">There is some new money for infrastructure but no mention of support for small projects like the Royal Canadian Legion in Kakabeka Falls. Municipalities in my riding cannot afford matching funds for the infrastructure projects they need. Non-profit organizations cannot afford large loans to improve their infrastructure and operations so they can continue to provide services to seniors, children and families in rural communities like Rainy River, Upsala and Atikokan. Because these and other local concerns are not adequately addressed in this budget, I will vote against the passage of this budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262650">Finally, I would be remiss if I did not take a moment to thank the liberal, green and progressive-minded constituents in my riding who voiced their support for our attempt to form a Liberal-New Democrat coalition government. I and the entire New Democrat caucus entered into that endeavour for the right reasons: to provide a stable, progressive and cooperative government that reflected the values of 62% of Canadian voters. Because of the shortsighted and ill-advised capitulation of the official opposition to the government on this budget, our progressive endeavour did not succeed.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1262654">One of the things that the budget does not do and does not take account is the consequences of a deep recession on ordinary Canadians who lose their jobs and go into a stressful situation in their families. Despair becomes the norm in the household. It affects things like health, mental and physical health. It also affects the utilization of social services where people need some help, where they cannot feed themselves or cope with the stresses of life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262655">As the member will probably know, when there is a recession the crime rate will go up. When people are desperate, bad things happen and that requires additional policing costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262656">The health care services, the social services and the policing services are all provided for by the provinces but the budget did not provide any increase in the transfers to the provinces. The formula stayed the same. It does not recognize that there will be a surcharge to be dealt with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262657">Does the member believe that the provinces have been left behind to pick up these pieces? Should this budget take into account that there will be higher costs for health care, social programs and criminal justice costs?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1262659">In terms of employment insurance, when employment insurance runs out for the people of Ontario and they have no other option, they apply for Ontario Works which is the direct responsibility, at least until 2018 or two or three Ontario governments from now, of the municipalities. That means that municipalities will be harder and harder hit as more and more people run out of employment insurance benefits. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262660">We were asking for up to two years of employment insurance benefits to ensure there would be less pressure on families and on the municipalities. The ball keeps on rolling and trickling down. Municipalities have less money, so if they need to match money for infrastructure projects, they will have less money over the next couple of years.

That is certainly welcome, but far more of a concern is the plight of our forestry families in our single industry towns that have been decimated by five and more years of recession in this sector. More than 38,000 good paying jobs have been lost in forestry during this period and tens of thousands more jobs are likely to be lost in the coming year and we hear of new losses almost daily. It was announced today that a forestry company in Thunder Bay will go into receivership tomorrow. AbitibiBowater, one of the largest, is now being faced with what we hope is not a permanent shutdown. It is a situation that is continuing to steamroll. Many of those workers have spent their entire lives working for one employer and now find themselves out of work for the first time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262663">Therefore, when I speak about the failure of the budget to help the forestry sector, I mean that the budget does nothing to help our forestry families and communities. There is no direct assistance for laid off forestry workers. Where there is some assistance, such as the community adjustment fund, our forestry communities must get in line with mining, agriculture, fishing and manufacturing dependent communities. It is simply not enough.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1262664">Mr. Speaker, it may be coincidental or fortuitous that I am following my electoral neighbour, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128620" Type="2">Thunder Bay—Rainy River</Affiliation>. I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="128600" Type="2">Wild Rose</Affiliation> today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262665"> I am very pleased to contribute to the debate regarding Canada's 2009 economic action plan. Indeed, this is not just an economic action plan to deal immediately with the global recession. It is a legacy document that will modernize Canada's infrastructure and position our great country to emerge from the global recession stronger than ever before and before other western countries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262666">This is not a partisan statement. For example, the International Monetary Fund recognized that Canada was one of the last countries to enter the recession and will be among the first to emerge. The economic action plan sends a strong message that the Conservative government will stick to its core principles and deal appropriately and effectively with the things that Canada needs to get through this recession. This economic action plan is a modest, manageable plan that will return us to surplus spending within five years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262667">I want to take some time to focus on how and why this is not just a good economic plan for Canada but more specifically for northwestern Ontario and my riding of <Affiliation DbId="128726" Type="2">Kenora</Affiliation>. Any action plan put forth had to deal with some very fundamental regional structural defects in the forestry and mining sectors peculiar to northwestern Ontario in order to ensure that the <Affiliation DbId="128726" Type="2">Kenora</Affiliation> riding could be competitive in areas of tourism, forestry and mining as we emerge from this global recession.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262668">I can say unequivocally that by the time I had finished the long form version of the economic plan, I was impressed with how comprehensive and detailed it was in addressing the priorities for the <Affiliation DbId="128726" Type="2">Kenora</Affiliation> riding, northwestern Ontario as a whole and other regions throughout Canada that depend on primary resources and the need for diversification for long term economic stability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262669">While I am impressed, I am not surprised. After the extensive initial consultations of my constituents, our government went back out on the road and performed more focused round table discussions to identify specific measures the federal government could take to support regions of Canada that rely on primary resource based economies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262670">On behalf of the <Affiliation DbId="128708" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="128848" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources and for the Canadian Wheat Board</Affiliation> and I held round tables in Kenora, Dryden, Thunder Bay, clear across to Sudbury. We met with forestry management and workers of companies like Domtar, Kenora Forest Products and a number of other mining and forestry sector people, including first nations stakeholders, in an unprecedented pre-economic action plan consultation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262671">This economic action plan has addressed, in a very technical, pragmatic and responsible way, not only how to deal with this global recession, but how to modernize our infrastructure and put the communities like the ones in my riding in the best position to diversify our regional economy and participate in a leaner, greener forestry and mining sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262672">This economic action plan takes immediate steps to invest almost $12 billion over two years in an infrastructure stimulus fund. This is key for northwestern Ontario, as we will see the twinning of parts of Highway 11 and 17, specifically from Clearwater Bay just outside of Kenora, to the Manitoba border. The twinning of this particular section of the highway not only provides for safer travel on the Trans-Canada Highway, but will also go a long way to fortify the vital transportation link between western and eastern Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262673">Emphasis focused on waste water and sewer treatment plants and shovel-ready projects that can start immediately are planned for our riding. We will increase broadband coverage and capacity to help ensure all regions of Canada are technologically on an equal footing. This is great news and critical for northwestern Ontario. Expanding broadband coverage in our region is essential for economic diversification, access to justice, training and education, and the delivery of health services, particularly to the more than 25 isolated communities in my riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262674">That is what I have heard from my friends at Keewaytinook Okimakanak who provide broadband services to these communities. I know they are pleased that the government is making a commitment to improve broadband capacity and service throughout Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262675">I note that there is significant funding as well under the RInK program to improve recreation centres such as ice rinks, pools and community centres, which are all important parts of our small communities' social and health fabric.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1262676">Key drivers of our economy include the production of primary and secondary wood products for things like housing and renovations. This plan provides $7.8 billion to build quality housing and stimulate construction. Social housing, retrofitting, renovating and upgrading first nations homes are key stimuli for the forestry sector. The home renovation tax credit will stimulate this sector and provide an incentive for folks to undertake these renovations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262677">Stimulus in the economic action plan is focused on regions like northwestern Ontario. We were the hardest hit by the impact of the global recession. Kenora felt it sooner and harder than most parts of our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262678">I am pleased that this government is investing over $1 billion over the next two years into the community adjustment fund. It keeps the Kenora riding in mind because it is intended to help new forestry products and processes, especially those for the international marketplace. The fund could support initiatives like the Whitefeather Two Feathers forestry initiative that will put the Kenora riding on the leading edge of the value-added industry within the forestry sector. Such an initiative would directly benefit the communities of Red Lake and Dryden and first nation communities such as Eagle Lake, Wabigoon and Pikangikum. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262679">I have always maintained and continue to focus my energies on ensuring that Kenora riding's economy must be focused on infrastructure and economic diversification that integrates and connects our communities together. We must work synchronously at all levels of government to ensure that we have the right keys and the right instruments for economic prosperity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262680">One of the extraordinary features of this economic action plan is the commitment to our first nations communities for training and skills development, housing and ready-to-go projects with priorities being given to schools, water and critical community services such as health and policing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262681"> These economic plan items were a direct response to the consultation our government made with first nation national leadership, as well as input from the grand chiefs and first nation leaders in my riding. I am pleased to report to this chamber that first nation leaders in my riding and in the riding of Thunder Bay—Rainy River have already voiced their optimism about the attention first nations were given directly and indirectly to this economic action plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262682">With regard to skills training for all northwestern Ontarians, our government's economic action plan is unprecedented. There is a realization that moving forward we need a highly skilled workforce to be successful. That is why we are providing funding for the Canada skills and transition strategy, which includes extra support for Canadians most affected by this recession.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262683">When I met with local industry in my riding, a key point I heard on more than one occasion was that changes needed to be made to employment insurance. This action plan offers a real response to people's needs by extending maximum benefits to a total of 50 weeks and extending work-sharing arrangements by an additional 14 weeks. This will help companies like Kenora Forest Products and Domtar avoid further layoffs. They expressly asked for this type of help. To that extent, this economic action plan has delivered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262684">Other important measures in our plan include increases to the basic personal exemption to 7.5% from 2008, raising the child benefit which will put an extra $436 in parents' pockets, tax savings for seniors, and novel tax-based incentivizing housing renovation, the benefits of which are twofold: they stimulate the purchase of building forest products and provide tax credits for folks who incur this type of expense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262685">Finally, special mention should be made for this government's commitment to FedNor, a brand and a program reputed throughout northern Ontario to support our communities in the process of economic diversification and initiatives. The additional funding for the next two years will go a long way to support several projects being planned or considered in communities throughout northern Ontario. This economic action plan should inspire confidence because it deals with some of the key aspects that northwestern Ontario needed to have addressed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262686">I want to express my extreme appreciation to my caucus for listening and understanding the kinds of support and measures the federal government could take to help put the Kenora riding on an equal footing with the other regions of Canada. I believe this economic action plan goes a long way to bringing the communities in my riding and across northwestern Ontario, including first nations, much closer to that goal.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1262687">Mr. Speaker, I think that the hon. member glossed over a wonderful opportunity. He is from Kenora. Kenora is an area which at the best of times has difficulties with employment and it is facing unique and specific challenges right now. I would have thought that the member would be a little more upset about the government's approach to employment insurance. This was a wonderful opportunity to actually address that issue, as every economic prognosticator is saying that more and more people are becoming unemployed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262688">It appears that the government chose a solution which nobody was asking for, namely to load the rear end of the time available, when in fact pretty well everyone was asking the government to shrink the two-week waiting period. Just because one is unemployed does not mean the bills stop. That two week period was an opportunity missed by the government, or it could have brought in some sort of uniform set of hours across the country, because whether one is unemployed in Kenora, Toronto or Miramichi, one is still unemployed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262689">I wonder whether the hon. member has approached the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and asked him why he missed this opportunity.

              <ParaText id="1262704">In the lead-up to this budget, the earliest federal budget in recent history, our government undertook the broadest and most comprehensive consultations ever. Our government met with and listened to thousands of individuals and groups across this great country. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> and others met with leaders of business and industry and with economists, community groups, provincial and municipal governments, members of the opposition and other stakeholders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262705">Personally, I spent six weeks travelling throughout my vast and diverse riding of Wild Rose listening to constituents' suggestions and concerns. I held open houses, community office hours, and attended various other meetings and events throughout the riding. Constituents in Wild Rose shared their thoughts with me verbally, both in person and on the phone, by email and letter, and they filled out surveys that we distributed at meetings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262706">Canadians shared with us their views, their hopes and their wishes for this country and for the budget, and we listened. We have delivered with Canada's economic action plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262707">This economic action plan is what is necessary for the circumstances in which we find ourselves today. It is extraordinary action for an extraordinary situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262708">The global economic crisis did not start here in Canada, but it is affecting us. While the depth and magnitude of this downturn are broader than anyone could have anticipated, we were certainly prepared for it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262709">Over the past couple of years we paid down $38 billion on the national debt. We strengthened our financial system. We reduced the overall tax burden on Canadians to its lowest level in nearly 50 years, including cutting the GST from 7% to 6% to 5%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262710">That is why this past fall the World Economic Forum rated our banking system as among the safest in the world. That is why we entered the global recession later than other countries, why we are not as deep into the recession as other countries, and why we are expected to come out of recession earlier than other countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262711">It is also why many other nations are emulating our actions, actions that have been widely viewed as the most prudent course of action leading up to this global economic recession.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262712">We were ahead of the curve and our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> led the way for the rest of the world. That is why Canada is one of the best positioned countries during these global economic challenges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262713">Let me now address the decision to run a deficit, as I know there are those in Wild Rose who will be concerned about this decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262714">Allow me to be very clear. We are in the midst of an unprecedented global economic slowdown, and we are taking the targeted action that we feel is necessary to stimulate our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262715">Let me be equally clear that this stimulus and the accompanying deficit is only temporary. We fully expect to return to a surplus situation in only a few short years. At that time our priority will be to repay the deficits expected in the next four years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262716">I liken our present situation to the average Canadian family or small business. When times are tough we must sometimes draw on a line of credit or use a credit card for a necessary purchase. However, when times improve and if we are being responsible, we immediately pay down the credit line and try to set aside money for a rainy day. That is what this government is doing. That is what we were doing when we paid off $38 billion of the national debt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262717">That is why this situation will be temporary and we will return to surpluses and debt reduction when we come out of this global economic storm.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262718">Our government is taking aggressive action to stimulate the economy with almost $12 billion to improve local and key national infrastructure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262719"> Many of the municipalities in my riding of Wild Rose have been among the fastest growing in the entire country over the last several years. Such explosive growth brings infrastructure challenges, the need for roads, overpasses, water and sewer, recreation and cultural facilities, to catch up with the increase in population. This investment in community infrastructure will help to address these challenges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262720">This investment also provides the double benefit of addressing community needs while stimulating the economy in the process, providing and creating employment for Canadians, and flowing money through the economy for needed supplies and materials.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262721">I am proud to report that among these projects is the funding to twin the final phase of the Trans-Canada Highway in Banff National Park in my riding all the way to the B.C. border. This is something that I know my predecessor Myron Thompson fought very hard for because I worked alongside him as he suffered through the inaction and indecision and complete ignorance of the former Liberal ministers on this file. It took a Conservative government to finally get action and to get this done and now it will be completed all the way to the B.C. border.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1262722">We are also taking action on another pressing need in my riding and throughout Canada, that of housing for seniors. As our population ages, this housing need will only grow larger in upcoming years. Our government is anticipating that need and providing for it now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262723">Our government is also stimulating housing construction through such measures as increasing the amount Canadians can withdraw from their RRSPs under the first-time home buyers' plan to provide a down payment for their new homes. We are also providing a tax credit to assist first-time home buyers with the costs associated with their home purchases and a renovation tax credit that will assist Canadians in undertaking renovations and improvements to their homes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262724">This program has already generated significant interest in my riding and, I am sure, across the country. It will be a huge benefit for many Canadian families. This tax credit encourages those who have been thinking about doing renovations maybe now, maybe in the future, to undertake them right now, which again creates the double benefit of helping Canadians with their needs while maintaining jobs and providing stimulus for the economy in these troubling times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262725">The very best stimulus for an economy is consumer confidence and consumer spending, and that is also the rationale behind our tax reductions, which are aimed at low- and middle-income Canadians, our seniors and our small businesses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262726">Canada's small and medium size businesses are the heart of Canada's economy. To help support our small business owners and the benefits and jobs they create for our economy, we are not only lowering their taxes but also ensuring their access to financing. Many small business owners in my riding have pointed out to me that they were facing this problem, and I am happy to be able to stand in the House of Commons today and report to them that their concerns were heard and that we are acting to ensure that they have access to the financing they need.</ParaText>

I will be happy to support her in those efforts. The most internationally known tourist destination in all Canada is the picturesque Banff National Park, which is in my riding. Our government has recognized the importance of our national parks in our tourism strategy by providing significant funding for improvements and enhancements to Parks Canada's visitor facilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262729">Just as the Bow Valley relies on tourism, so do many parts of my riding rely on agriculture as a major part of our economy. Through many actions, including items contained in this budget, we are supporting our farmers. This support includes providing $500 million for an agricultural flexibility program that will support innovation in the industry. We will help to make credit available for new farmers and to help support farmers in transferring the farm to the next generation. This is an important first step in helping to ensure the future survival of the family farm.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1262739">Mr. Speaker, there is a very stark contrast between the approach of our government and the approach of the previous government in those times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262740">The first thing I would draw to members' attention would be the fact that our government undertook to deal with the situation very quickly and in consultation with many groups and individuals across Canada. We listened to Canadians and took action based on what we were hearing from them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262741">Another very strong contrast between the actions we have taken is that the previous Liberal government chose, at that time, to slash funding to health care and to other payments to provinces. That was done on the backs of the provinces. Our government has chosen instead to try to stimulate the economy through spending and through working with provinces and municipalities in a partnership to deal with the times we are facing. That is how our government has approached it. Rather than trying to put it on the backs of other levels of government, we have worked with them to try to get through these tough times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262742">We have also provided tax credits and tax cuts for Canadians to help them stimulate the economy through consumer spending and consumer confidence. That is the difference between the action our government is taking and the action we have seen on the other side.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1262743">Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="128147" Type="2">Chambly—Borduas</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262744">In my opinion, this budget is a missed opportunity. We had a chance to help the most vulnerable members of society through the economic crisis, strengthen Quebec's economy and invest in forestry and manufacturing, the industries that are in crisis in Quebec. We have been talking about this for years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262745">According to Statistics Canada, between December 2007 and December 2008, my riding alone, Trois-Rivières, lost 3,200 out of a total of 69,000 jobs. The people in my riding are hurting, and we were really hoping this budget would offer at least some solutions to the economic crisis. It was vitally important to my constituents. When plants close, there are mass layoffs and people lose their jobs. It is truly devastating, and it is incredibly discouraging. But instead of offering solutions, this government turned its back on Quebec, and the bulk of the federal assistance went to Ontario and the auto industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262746">The Bloc Québécois had proposed a number of solutions to this crisis as early as last November. But for purely partisan reasons, the Conservative government rejected these proposals,which promised a better future for Quebec. In addition to amending the equalization formula without consultation and creating a single securities regulator, this budget leaves Quebec's forestry and manufacturing industries in the lurch. MPs from Quebec are going to have to choose between Quebec's interests and Canada's.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262747">Quebec's industrial base is different from the industrial base in the rest of Canada. The federal government had a duty to support Quebec's economy in these tough times. It did not. This budget is clearly anti-Quebec, and it misses the mark.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262748">As far as natural resources are concerned—one of my concerns as a critic—I would like to speak about the forestry sector. This budget afforded the government a golden opportunity to help the forestry and manufacturing sectors. The forests are important to Quebec, with in excess of 200,000 direct and indirect jobs on which whole communities depend. In the Trois-Rivières et Mauricie region alone, thousands of jobs depend on the forests. There is no help for them in this budget. In fact, compared to the $2.7 billion allocated solely to the auto industry, concentrated in Ontario, the $170 million for the forestry industry seems mightly slim. It is clearly inadequate and unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262749">As well, of that $170 million, $10 million is earmarked for the promotion of “Buy Canadian” in foreign lumber markets. What can that mean to a company incapable of generating any profit because it has been strangled by one crisis after another for the past five years? What those companies need—as we have said on numerous occasions in this House—is repayable loans and loan guarantees to upgrade their equipment. The federal government's mission is to enable these companies to modernize in times of crisis in order to improve their productivity on the international stage and enable them to recover when the economic situation improves. Yet the conservative government has abandoned the Quebec forest industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262750">When this industry has been hit by one crisis after another since 2004, such as the softwood lumber dispute, the forestry crisis, the drop in U.S. demand, and now the financial crisis, the federal government should be helping it get back on its feet. Instead it has done nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262751">A reading of this budget clearly shows that funding to the Quebec forest industry is a joke. This is a glaring example of the Conservative government turning its back on Quebec. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262752">The Bloc Québécois is attempting to rectify some of this with the amendment to the amendment put forward in the House today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262753">Let us talk about equalization. The amendment to the equalization formula, without consulting Quebec and the provinces, is an insult to all Quebeckers. This amendment will cut $1 billion from equalization payments to Quebec this year.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1262754">Need I remind hon. members that it is the Government of Quebec that provides health services and education, the cornerstones of a healthy economy? A shortfall of $1 billion this year will leave Quebeckers on the hook. The budgets of schools, hospitals and all front-line stakeholders will be cut. That is unacceptable for any Quebec MP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262755">Once again, just like when the Liberals were in power, the federal government is transferring its problems to Quebec. This clearly illustrates that the fiscal imbalance has not been resolved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262756">The National Assembly has unanimously voted against this “one-way federalism”. For that reason and as defenders of the interests of Quebec, and of Quebec alone, we will vote against this budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262757">It is evident from this budget that recognition of the Quebec nation is but an empty shell devoid of any meaning for this government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262758">The budget indicates that they want to move forward with a single securities commission in Toronto. We find that unacceptable. To top it off, this government is even considering going to the Supreme Court to interfere in a matter that is strictly the jurisdiction of Quebec. And yet, the current system is working very well. It has been held up as an example by the OECD. The current way of doing things works well. The passport system, like the European system, allows for a co-ordinated approach in the application of legislation, a uniform and pan-Canadian protection of investors. Why dismantle what works?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262759">Creating a single securities commission would result in a regulatory monopoly in Toronto. It would eliminate from the current system the advantages of regulatory competition. This system, which is working well, would work even better if Ontario decided to not go it alone and joined Quebec and the provinces that have already come to an agreement on this matter. The reason for Ontario's refusal to cooperate is quite simple. Like Ottawa, the province wishes to centralize all regulatory matters in Toronto. It is as simple as that. Calling for better protection is tantamount to stating the existing commissions are not doing their job. That is absolutely false.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262760">The presence of the 13 regulators ensures that the creation and implementation of regulations will take into account the diverse opinions and ensure adequate representation of small markets. This structure has even allowed for innovation, both in Quebec and in western Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262761">The OECD has ranked Canada second when it comes to securities regulation. The World Bank also described as Canada a leader in the field. This recognition also reflects on Quebec, which, through the Autorité des marchés financiers, contributes to Canada's excellence. Why would the federal government want to change a system that works, that is held in high regard around the world, and that allows efficient and effective protection of financial operations in Quebec and Canada? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262762">The Bloc Québécois will strongly oppose the creation of a single, centralized securities commission in Toronto, and it fully supports the Autorité des marchés financiers du Québec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262763">Several things become clear upon reading the budget. First of all, the Conservative government has decided to ignore Quebec's demands. Instead of helping Quebeckers, this government decided to divest them of significant resources to deal with this crisis, particularly by cutting off $1 billion in equalization payments to Quebec beginning this year, and by going ahead with its plans for a securities commission.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262764">Compared to the $2.7 billion given only to the auto industry, which is centred in Ontario, the $170 million for the forestry industry seems paltry. Clearly, it is not enough. And what are we to say about the fact that this same government will not uphold the rights of women to settle pay equity issues in court?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262765">For all these reasons, we will vote against this budget and we are proposing this subamendment, which reflects the unanimous demands of the Quebec people and the Quebec National Assembly.</ParaText>

The concern in our area is for the water treatment plant that is in desperate need of upgrading. We are talking in the area of $100 million. The Province of Ontario has said that it is in for $100 million but if we are talking about matching funds it makes the project almost unfeasible for Hamilton.

Let us not forget that our water systems, among other things, are very old. A lot of our aging infrastructure needs upgrading. It is not at all clear that municipalities will be able to cover 50% of the cost, given their shrinking tax base.

              <ParaText id="1262774">Mr. Speaker, I must again congratulate my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128287" Type="2">Trois-Rivières</Affiliation>. In my opinion, she has explained my party's position very well, so I shall try to avoid going back over what she has addressed. I will, moreover, try to demonstrate in my speech that something rather intriguing has been going on here. I will take my cue from the reaction other parliamentarians, coming from parliaments in other countries, would have if they came here and tried to understand what is happening just now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262775">There is a party in power, a party that in November presented an ideological and highly partisan economic statement, which provoked a reaction in the majority opposition, which then created a coalition, and that in turn created the situation we have experienced: the highly arbitrary prorogation of the House. In other words, the Queen was asked to keep the elected representatives out until the government could redo its homework. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262776">We ended up with a coalition of Liberals and New Democrats, supported by the Bloc Québécois. I mention this because it enabled us to understand the position of each party in opposition with respect to its commitments to their constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262777">The platform on which that coalition was based is still to this day the platform embraced by the Liberals. I would say that it has also generated consultations by the Conservatives themselves. I have a summary here that gives an overview of that, and there are more available. The newspaper that covers the riding of Lévis-Bellechasse is called <I>La Voix du Sud </I> and the member for that riding reports that he consulted the public. We believe this because it was reported in the media. This consultation reveals that the people in his riding told him just about the same thing that we have been saying here: improvements need to be made to employment insurance and accessibility to it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262778">He was even told that the number of hours to qualify for benefits should be 360. And he was told that the waiting period needed to be done away with. That is what he heard from them and that is what has been said by the Liberals, the NDP and ourselves. The Conservatives have said it, too. They heard it from us here. We even told them that the guaranteed income supplement needed to be indexed and that the seniors who had been cheated out of it needed retroactivity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262779">None of this is reflected in the budget. Yet we are told that the budget was based on the consultations that had been held. I have heard our Liberal colleagues say the same thing in this House. They also confirmed their intentions in the coalition platform. What is more, the Liberals have criticized the government for tabling such a budget, yet they are saying that they are going to vote in favour of the budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262780">If I were a parliamentarian from another country, sitting here listening to this and watching this, I would wonder what was going on. Do these people represent their constituents or not? What are they playing at? In light of the mandate given to them by their constituents, do they have a responsibility to come into this House and do what they say they are going to do?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262781">In November, the Conservatives delivered an ideological throne speech and an ideological economic statement. They wanted to come up with a slightly more progressive budget. Today, the Liberals are talking like progressives, but they are going to vote with the Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1262782">People are understandably confused and no longer know who to trust, because the Liberals and the Conservatives are all the same. It is true that they are all the same. They all vote the same way when it comes to attacking fundamental rights. It is a fact. The government has eroded women's rights and workers' rights. Workers in Quebec do not have the same rights as workers in other provinces. For example, the government is injecting money into the auto industry in Ontario. It is right to invest in this sector. We are not saying that these people do not deserve support. But if they deserve support, then logically, the government should make the same commitment to Quebec and take the same steps to help such important sectors as manufacturing and forestry. There can be no double standard. The same logic should apply to parliamentarians here. They, too, should walk the talk, especially our Liberal friends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262783">The same is true of culture, which my colleague talked about. The government has made cuts that have affected our artists' ability to perform on other stages, in other countries. The government is going to provide funding so that foreign artists can come here to share their culture with us, but our artists do not have access to funding for the same purpose.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262784">Concerning the national securities commission, what reason is there to abolish something or make it more fragile when it is working well, other than the desire to centralize and create an economic power concentrated in Toronto?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262785">As for low-income families, the Liberal Party has made them one of their pet issues. It said that we should help the weakest, the poorest, in our society. We see that this budget contains measures that will support the wealthiest in our society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262786">I will finish by speaking about employment insurance. My colleague spoke about it. Something quite dramatic is happening. Not only do our federal friends here not want to introduce measures that would allow workers who have lost their jobs to have access to employment insurance benefits, but the budget would lock things up so tightly that we would not be able to implement any improvements. For one thing, rates are being frozen at the lowest level we have seen since 1982. That is rather odd. However, it is one of the messages heard in every riding, even those represented by Conservatives. Earlier, I read the summaries of their consultations. Our Liberal friends have made it one of their pet issues and, today, they will vote in favour of the budget, a budget that will block any possibility of improving employment insurance benefits and, above all, accessibility. In fact, 60% of people who lose their jobs cannot access employment insurance benefits. It is a major problem and it is one of the measures that is impoverishing our society and the people who are already struggling without jobs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1262798">Mr. Speaker, the member raised some interesting issues, particularly about EI. The member has been very vocal on the subject with regard to the need to have a vision as to what is going to happen to the people in each and every one of Canada's provinces and regions when the full impact of the job loss occurs. We have inevitable problems with older workers, who may never find the gainful employment that they enjoyed before they lost their jobs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262799">We have a government that failed to recognize that the EI system is already overloaded, that there are significant delays in processing claims, that people are going to need it, and that the government should have thought of dealing with the two-week waiting period as opposed to simply adding five weeks to the end. It fails to recognize these challenges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262800">It also fails to recognize that people who lose their jobs are in a stressful, desperate situation. Health care costs are going to go up as a result of mental and physiological problems, as well as the demand on social services that will need to be provided, and the fact that crime and criminal justice costs will inevitably rise, particularly policing. Health care, social services and policing costs are all provincially funded and yet the transfers to the provinces did not go up to take care of these inevitable problems that are going to occur.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262801">I ask the member whether or not he sees these as potential problems that people in Canada are going to face as a result of this and that the government has in fact failed to respond to the inevitable needs of Canadians.</ParaText>

He raised a number of points. I will address two of them, since we do not have much time. Indeed, we have a serious problem involving older people who are losing their jobs and who have no options, since they cannot find another job. This is a serious problem because they have no income potential. Once there was a program called POWA, the program for older worker adjustment, which needs to be brought back. Both the Liberal Party, when it was in power, and the Conservative Party have promised to bring it back. No one has kept that promise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262803">I also share my hon. colleague's opinion regarding the importance of eliminating the two week waiting period before employment insurance benefits kick in. This would give people an income very quickly, especially in an economic crisis such as this one. As we all know, whenever someone loses their job, they suffer quit a jolt, which is costly enough. No one has money to burn when they lose their job.</ParaText>

I am pleased to say today that this raises the level of debate in the House which has been needed for a long time. I really appreciate his demeanour because the passion that is behind such feelings often spills over.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262806">The budget talks about employment insurance. The fact is that we do not get any change not only in the two weeks at the front end but in those who will qualify.

This waiting period of 28 days is long enough. It is significant. When you lose your job, you often have new expenses and you already have to wait 28 days. It is unacceptable that the waiting period is so long, especially today, given that we have the resources to organize our services more efficiently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262811">In summary, in this budget, employment insurance measures include a five-week extension of benefits, but only for recipients. 60% of applicants do not receive benefits.

              <ParaText id="1262814">I am pleased to speak today in favour of Canada's economic action plan, as tabled by the hon. <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, and I respectfully encourage all my fellow parliamentarians to support budget 2009. In my view, the government's economic action plan provides much-needed stimulus for our nation's economy that is timely, targeted, temporary and cost effective. I believe that the measures contained in our plan will lay the foundation for long term growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262815">As we all know, Canada is facing the domestic effects of an unprecedented global financial crisis. Our financial institutions, while strong and sound by international standards, face the double jeopardy of an unavailability of liquidity to provide much needed loans to business and a short term negative economic forecast that causes them to hold back in making the loans and investments that Canadian business requires.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262816">Credit-worthy Canadian businesses cannot access necessary sources of debt and equity to operate in the normal course and make the types of investments that will enable them to enhance their competitiveness and operate in a more environmentally sustainable way. Hard-working families are justifiably worried about their jobs and financial security and accordingly are cautious about spending and incurring debt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262817">These are truly extraordinary times. This is not a normal economic downturn. Despite the fact that Canada's economy is in relatively much better shape than any G7 nation, thanks in large part to the previously implemented economic and fiscal policies of this government, we must take extraordinary steps now to offset the domestic effects of the current crisis in world financial systems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262818">Given Canada's very favourable debt to GDP ratio, we have an opportunity now to borrow modestly at historically low interest rates and put that money to work for all Canadians to soften the impact of a financial crisis created beyond our borders and to help our economy emerge stronger, more competitive and a leader in cutting edge technology and industries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262819">The economic action plan is a coordinated plan that will simultaneously protect jobs through critical support for the auto industry, tax incentives for new investments in production machinery and environmental technologies and generous enhancements to the employment insurance program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262820">It will create new jobs through immediate and strategic investments in roads, bridges, public buildings, colleges and universities, investments that will enhance the efficiency of our economy and improve the quality of life for Canadians throughout this great land. It will maintain and create further jobs by incentivizing consumers to purchase homes and automobiles, and to renovate existing homes to enhance their value and energy efficiency. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262821">It will also protect the most vulnerable in our society by providing significant new support for training for those laid-off workers to give them the knowledge and skills required to shift into new and emerging industries. It will provide tax cuts for hard-working, low income Canadians and significant new investments in affordable housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262822">The economic action plan is proof that we listened and delivered. As members know, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and all of our members of Parliament met across the country with thousands of individuals, businesses, municipal and provincial governments and other stakeholders. This broad and comprehensive consultation process elicited many good suggestions, which are reflected in the economic action plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262823">As a Conservative member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance, I have participated in meetings with over 45 stakeholder groups. In my home province of Ontario, I met with the region of Peel, the city of Mississauga, local boards of trade, labour groups, charitable and social welfare organizations and ordinary citizens at public town hall meetings. In all of those consultations there quickly emerged a consensus on broad initiatives to stimulate our economy and protect workers and the most vulnerable in our society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1262824">I am pleased to acknowledge that these important and desired initiatives have been included in Canada's economic action plan. We were advised by the Mississauga Board of Trade and many others to revise the employment insurance program to help save jobs through work-sharing.
