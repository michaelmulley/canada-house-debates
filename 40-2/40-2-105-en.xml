            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="128485" Type="2">Mr. Dean Allison (Niagara West—Glanbrook, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1665590">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to talk about Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document> and the technical amendments that are being made to it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665591">Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document> is our government's proposed legislation to temporarily extend employment insurance regular benefits for unemployed long-tenured workers. For the purpose of this legislation, long-tenured workers are defined as Canadians who have paid EI premiums for years but have made limited use of EI regular benefits. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665592">Of the Canadians who have lost their jobs since the end of January 2009 and made an EI claim, about one-third are long-tenured workers. Many of these people have worked in the same industry and even at the same job for most of their adult lives. However, now, because of the recession, they find themselves unemployed. Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document> would give these workers additional weeks of employment insurance while they look for new jobs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665593">Specifically, this measure would provide from five to twenty additional weeks of EI regular benefits depending on how long a long-tenured worker has been employed and paying EI premiums. We estimate about 190,000 workers would benefit from this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665594">These people have worked hard, have paid their taxes and, of course, have paid their EI premiums. It is only fair and right that we should help them during this temporary downturn. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665595">Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document> is a temporary measure. It is designed to give long-tenured workers the short-term support they need to rebuild their lives. Our hope is that their fortunes will improve as the economy rebounds. However, in the meantime, we want to make sure these extra weeks of benefits available to eligible workers are available as soon as possible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665596">That brings me back to the amendment. Originally, the start date for eligibility was linked to the coming into force of this bill. However, we want to allow time for a full debate. At the same time, we want to ensure that all eligible long-tenured workers have full access to the extended benefits, even if royal assent is delayed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665597">That is why we are proposing a technical amendment to establish a fixed date of January 4, 2009 for eligibility. This would ensure that all long-tenured workers who have lost their jobs in 2009 will be eligible for additional weeks of benefits regardless of how long it takes for the bill to be approved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665598">The establishment of a fixed date would not affect long-tenured workers' ability to claim extended benefits until September 11, 2010, nor would it affect the payment of these extended benefits into the fall of 2011. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665599">As I have said, Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document> is a temporary measure. Long-tenured workers receiving extended benefits can expect a gradual transition back to normal terms and conditions. To that end, beginning in June of 2011, the level of additional benefits would be reduced in five-week increments. We believe that Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document> would come as great comfort to long-tenured workers who may be worried about exhausting their benefits before they can find a new job. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665600">As we have been looking at this bill over the last couple of weeks in the HUMA committee, some concerns have been raised. People wondered why there is the cutoff, how we can protect the greatest number of jobs, et cetera. It is great that NDP members have been willing to support this part. They realize that there would be almost 190,000 people who would benefit from and have access to this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665601">People have asked us why this would be in effect for 2009. That is clearly when a lot of the unemployment occurred. We realize there was unemployment before then, and that is why we have extended benefits by up to five weeks, and over 300,000 people have benefited. We have expanded our work-sharing program and protected over 165,000 jobs. Work-sharing programs are something that probably a lot of Canadians are not familiar with, but I think they have been very practical and they make a lot of sense. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="05">(1205)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1665602">We have companies that may be struggling and do not need all of their workers at this point in time because of the economy. EI has been able to go in and work with these companies and have them work-share, so that employees may only work three or four days a week and are able to collect some EI. I think that is a very practical measure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665603">As we heard from some of our witnesses last week, people are concerned about who would have a chance to claim these benefits. I think 190,000 people speaks volumes in terms of who can receive this benefit at this particular time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665604">The other thing I want to make note of, and we have talked about it before in previous debates, is the fact that this government has frozen EI premiums. This is a particularly difficult time right now for business. I know that freezing EI premiums has been a good thing, not only for business people and businesses but also for those Canadians who would have to pay those EI premiums.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665605">I know there are a number of things we have been looking at, what we have been delivering and what we have been able to deliver on. We believe that some of the money that has been set aside, over $0.5 billion, for training for long-tenured workers could help up to 40,000 Canadians. We realize we have an additional $1.5 billion for training for those who are on EI and who do not necessarily qualify. We are helping about 150,000 people on top of the $2.5 billion that we already spend annually on training. I think these are important things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665606">We realize that as the economy shifts sometimes we lose some of these industries in towns that have been dependent on some of these jobs, certain companies and industries over time. One of the ways we believe we can help these workers is by training them for the jobs of the future. That is why this government has been very committed to continually spending money on training.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665607">We have also looked at $60 million for helping older workers. We realize the kind of invaluable knowledge and experience they have. We realize the kind of potential they have. I think this is something that is so important, that we continue to deal with these challenging times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665608">I just want to talk about some of the comments that we have heard from individuals.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1665637">Mr. Speaker, we are here today discussing Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document>, which has now come back from committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665638">The position of the Liberal Party has not changed on the bill. We think that there are numerous problems with this bill in terms of what it does to impact people who were the victims of a very difficult recession in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665639">It was a very interesting process at committee. Normally, at a committee, when somebody comes with a bill, particularly a government bill, we have a number of witnesses who say, “I like it. Go ahead”, and others who say, “I do not like it. Stop it”. What we had this time, and I am sure the member for <Affiliation DbId="128147" Type="2">Chambly—Borduas</Affiliation> would concur with this as well as other members of the HR committee, were largely two groups of people who came to the committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665640"> We had people who came and said, “This is not a good bill. This is a discriminatory bill. It does not help enough people. It does not go back far enough. It does not do enough to cushion the blow of this recession. You should vote it down”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665641">We had others who came to the committee and said, “We do not like it. It is not our priority for employment insurance. We know that there are further changes that are necessary, but with these guys, we better take what we can get. In light of that, perhaps you should support it and try to get something else”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665642">We have been talking about employment insurance in this House, as Canadians have in the country, for the better part of the last year. Before that, it was an issue, but particularly in the last year with this recession, people have been very concerned. What have people been asking about? What have people called for in terms of EI?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665643">For a number of years, we have had public sector unions, policy think tanks and a host of people who have looked at this issue. They have said that there are ways in which we can adjust EI. I think we can all understand that. They have said, “There were changes made in the 1990s as a result of the economic circumstance that this country was in. Maybe we should look at what we did then. Maybe it is time to have some new reforms. What would you do?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665644">There are people who have been talking for a long time about changes: a national standard of 360 hours or some such variation on that national standard; eliminating the two week waiting period, as our colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128316" Type="2">Brome—Missisquoi</Affiliation> has in a private member's bill that will be coming back to this House; increasing the rate of benefits from 55% to 60%; looking at the divisor rule; and looking at how we calculate benefits and perhaps going to the best 12 weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665645">There are all kinds of ways that we can change employment insurance. I would not say that we should do all of those things. I am an advocate for employment insurance reform. I do not know exactly what I would do, but I know I would not let it go the way it is now. I know that I would invest in employment insurance so that people who need the benefit can get it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665646">I do not think people are fully aware in Canada that our EI system is not as robust as most nations to which we want to compare ourselves. We think we are very generous in terms of employment insurance. We should keep in mind that this is the money that employers and employees have put aside for difficult times, but our system does not fare well compared to some others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665647">In the 1990s, when the economy was good and it was strong and we had surpluses, we reduced EI premiums for both the employers and employees for 12 years in a row. That was one period of time. We could argue about what should have been done then, but in a recession, in a difficult time, this is when we should invest in EI.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665648">We have had the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, the Caledon Institute, the CLC and the CAW telling us what things they would like to see, but it is not just them. <I>TD Economics</I> is urging the government to immediately ease the VER and extend EI. VER is the variable entrance requirements. We need to ensure that people get access to EI across the board.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665649">The Canadian Chamber of Commerce gave advice to the government last year, when it suggested that the federal government could consider temporary measures to ease access to EI during the recession, reducing the number of weeks required to qualify for benefits and suspending the two week waiting period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665650">That was the Chamber of Commerce in December saying we should look at the two week waiting period. The CSN referred to the waiting period, the universal entitlement of 360 hours, and increasing the benefit level.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1665656">Members of the House have put forward private member's bills. In March, the New Democrats put forward an opposition day that called for the elimination of the two week waiting period, a national standard of 360 hours going to 60% of insurable earnings, going to a best 12 weeks divisor and referring to some kind of a self-employment piece. Those are the priorities of the New Democrats, which I think reflect the priorities of many Canadians. Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document> is woefully short on that measure. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665657">The head of the CAW, in referring to Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document>, said that Canadians “need a full loaf of bread”. He suggested that it was just crumbs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1665660">The bill has not received any kind of universal enthusiastic support. Some people have said that perhaps we need to take what we can get and move on, but we need to look at this seriously and ask whether this is good legislation and whether we can seriously adopt a piece of social infrastructure that discriminates against so many Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665661">The government's own estimates are that 190,000 people will benefit. I do not know if that is true. I asked people at committee if it was true but they could not tell me because they did not have access to the kind of information that HRSDC does. What does the government do with that information?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665662">In the summer, I remember the Conservatives suggesting that a 360 hour national standard would cost $4.4 billion. The next week they apologized and said that it would be $2.5 billion. It turns out that it would be less than $1.3 billion. Therefore, we do not have a lot to work with on this. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1665665">He suggested that it did not even have to be in legislation. He also said “the problems with the employment insurance system have not been addressed at all, including the pressing problem of eligibility”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665666">At the end of July this past summer, the 10 premiers of the 10 provinces called on the Prime Minister to resolve this problem. Most Quebec municipalities signed a declaration demanding that the eligibility question be solved at the federal level. The FCM, as well as many economists, observers, associations, unions and even the churches called on the government to resolve the eligibility problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665667">We have a bill that is a discriminatory. As I referenced earlier in a question for my colleague, the chair of our committee, the minister herself, in touting the five week extension, said that extending five extra weeks of benefits which was then only available in some regions to all Canadians. So she is saying that what we are doing is giving a benefit that some Canadians have to pilot projects and we are giving it to all Canadians. What could be more fair?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665668">Now we have a circumstance where the government has introduced a bill that picks winners and losers. It does not cushion the blow of what is called the early shock troops of the recession, those who lost their jobs a year ago now and are not eligible for any of the benefit no matter how long they have been on EI. We do not think that is fair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665669">The conundrum that we have as a party is what to do in this circumstance. We do not want to see people further disenfranchised. For example, when the bill came to committee it would have come into force in a way that meant if we gave it suitable study it would mean people who were laid off after January 4 might not get benefits. We indicated at committee that while we did not support the bill, one of the reasons we did not support it was that it did not affect enough workers. We certainly did not want to disenfranchise any more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665670">In our view, Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document> is not a suitable response to the recession. It decides that some people are worthy of employment insurance and some are not. We do not think that is the way Canadians look at our social infrastructure system. We do not think that would be done with medicare or with any other social infrastructure. We think it is the wrong way to go about it. It is not a suitable response and we will be voting against the bill when it comes back.</ParaText>

The president of the Canadian Labour Congress, like the other witnesses, said that he was not enthusiastic about the bill. He thought it did not go far enough, and that more changes needed to be made to EI. The Liberals' cuts in 1996 took a toll on workers. However, at the end, he asked the committee and all the parties to vote in favour of the bill, because he did not want workers to be denied what little they have been offered.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1665682">However, in terms of supporting this, in January, the government's inadequate response was an extra five weeks for everybody and more money for employment and training.

In their defence, they had indicated that before they saw it, so they have a certain defence in that case, but that was for everybody.

              <ParaText id="1665684">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak in the House on my party's behalf about this important bill, Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665685">I think it is important because it shows the Conservative government and the NDP's true colours when it comes to employment insurance. It is quite disturbing. This is a bad bill, and we do not support it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665686">We are not the only ones in Quebec who do not support this bill. People are pretty much unanimous. Unions are unanimous, and they represent 1.2 million workers. If we consider the families of those workers as well, over 2.5 million of the 8 million people in our province are against it. So are all unemployed workers' organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665687">The people most affected by this bill will be unemployed workers, and their organizations do not like it. I will go on to explain why they do not like it. The forestry industry is unanimous in its opposition as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665688">The Canadian Federation of Woodlot Owners has spoken out in favour of this bill, but when asked if people in Quebec felt the same way, they said no. We came to the same conclusion. The reason such unanimity exists in Quebec is that the Conservatives are turning their backs on Quebec, and so is the NDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665689">Why does everyone agree on this? My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128521" Type="2">Dartmouth—Cole Harbour</Affiliation> explained why earlier: this bill is discriminatory because it introduces the utterly distasteful and unjustified principle that unemployed workers fall into two camps: good ones and bad ones. This bill is also mean because it is designed to exclude as many people as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665690">Earlier, my Conservative colleague said that this bill targets long-tenured workers. It is arbitrary because it excludes workers who have worked fewer than seven years. Nobody who has worker fewer than seven years will be affected by this measure or benefit from it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665691">In addition, all workers who have worked for more than seven years but who did not contribute 30% of the employee's premium for 10, 12 or 15 years, for example, depending on their situation, will also be excluded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665692">And individuals who have been unfortunate enough to receive employment insurance for more than 35 weeks will be excluded, even if they have worked for more than seven years. Who is left? Not very many people, considering that everyone with a precarious job is also excluded. When we do the math based on the government's approach, we reach the conclusion that only 6% of EI recipients can hope to benefit from this bill. That is a far cry from 190,000 unemployed. We are talking about roughly 47,900 people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665693">When officials come to talk to us about 190,000 unemployed, they say that this will extend over three years and so we have to multiply by the number of generations of unemployed. At that rate, we could say that instead of spending $21 billion a year on national defence, our government will spend $420 billion because the spending is spread over 20 years. You can take that sort of logic to extremes. But, in a budget debate, the government is used to quoting figures based on a snapshot of the economy at a given point. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665694">How many workers are unemployed at present? Between 1.7 million and 1.8 million. How many people are receiving benefits? There are 765,000. If we take that figure and multiply it by 6%, we get 45,900.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1665695">Why is the government misleading the House and the public? By inflating the figures, it is trying to make people accept the unacceptable, namely principles that are completely disgraceful and totally discriminatory. That is what the NDP is doing. The government is making entitlement contingent on hours of employment, how much the claimant has paid in premiums and how many weeks of benefits he or she has already received.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665696">The Conservative member said that long-tenured workers are people who have worked hard, as if everyone else had not worked hard. He said that they are people who have paid taxes, as if everyone else had not paid taxes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665697">We do not buy that. We cannot support that. Parliament is going to support discriminatory rules, but we are totally opposed to that. This bill is a symbolic political gesture that the government is trying to justify by dressing it up in lace and frills. It is also an insult to people's intelligence. It is important to say here that the government is not going to address the need for comprehensive EI reform with piecemeal measures like these, which create good and bad classes of unemployed workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665698">The parties, including the Conservatives, have agreed on some measures in the past, measures that we in the opposition unanimously agree on here today, including for example, improving accessibility to employment insurance, since the majority of workers have been deliberately excluded from EI benefits. The previous government wanted to accumulate a surplus and use that money for other things. So unemployed workers and employers were relieved, not to say robbed, of $57 billion. The government used that $57 billion for other things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665699">These measures include the 360-hour eligibility criterion with, of course, the possibility of a 70-hour reduction, based on the number of unemployed workers per region. Instead of 45 weeks, 50 weeks of benefits are needed, as well as 60% of earnings. At present, people received 55% of their income. These are some of the measures on which we agreed. Our NDP friends have been fooled by the smoke and mirrors, and have forgotten these crucial measures, along with the notion of being entitled to benefits based on good faith. Furthermore, the two week waiting period must be eliminated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665700">Instead, we have a government that has locked up the employment insurance fund. It is making sure that premiums remain at their minimum, so there are not enough resources to improve the system, even though everyone agrees that the current problem is not related to premiums. People are willing to accept higher premiums in order to benefit from social measures that will allow people who unfortunately lose their jobs to continue to feed their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665701">We are seeing the old Conservative theory of taking away every possible means, so they can later justify the fact that they do not want to improve conditions for our citizens. The Conservatives did this with the GST. They are doing it again with employment insurance premiums.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1665702">Mr. Speaker, in a way, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128147" Type="2">Chambly—Borduas</Affiliation> is accusing the NDP of wanting to pass Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document> with the Conservatives. I am in favour of this bill. We have said that we will vote in favour of this bill. However, it is as though the hon. member from the Bloc is trying to tell us that no one in Quebec would benefit from this. As though no one has worked 12 months a year in the last seven to ten years and no one is affected by this economic crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665703">I agree with the hon. member from the Bloc when he says that we need more than this and that everyone should benefit from it. He is very familiar with our bills. We are familiar with theirs. We have worked together. It is true that we want better than this, but there is a bill currently on the table.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665704">My question for him is the following: is he prepared to say that in Quebec no worker will benefit from this bill and that the workers he is saying no to will be pleased? People who have worked for 10 or 15 years and who are going through this economic crisis would lose the little bit that the House of Commons is giving them. We are not voting on a budget, but on a specific bill that could help certain workers. I am proud of that and I will say so in my speech. At least we will be helping, even if we are not in the government. A government is in place and it is offering something for workers. This is not the first discriminatory bill. I have seen the Bloc vote in favour of similar bills that were not good for all Canadians. I will talk about that later in my speech. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665705">I would like to know whether the hon. member is prepared to say no to certain long-tenured workers who have lost their jobs in Quebec during the economic crisis.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1665706">Mr. Speaker, first of all, the problem is to find them and then, when we do, they are represented by unions and associations representing the unemployed, which say that rather than putting in place a measure that discriminates against their colleagues, they prefer to continue fighting for a more equitable measure. That is why Quebec is unanimous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665707">I see that the NDP, like the Conservatives, has turned its back on Quebec. That is their decision, that is their right. However, I would like to ask my colleague a question. He is one of the members who told the minister that he would vote for the bill because the cut-off date had to be eliminated, meaning that we must quickly adopt the bill to ensure that people can benefit from it nevertheless. I do not know if he realizes it, but the amendment allows the government to do indirectly what it said it would not do directly. I refer him to clause 1(<I>a</I>)(i), which indicates that those who obtain benefits at a later date are not included.</ParaText>

According to this principle, you would no longer be entitled to use it. You would have to come back in seven, ten or fifteen years. That is the yardstick. The same thing would apply, unfortunately, if you had a piece of furniture in your living room that burnt and you called your insurance agent. Six or seven years later, when something else burns, you want to file a claim with your insurance company. However, you are told that you will have to wait another year. It is the same principle, except more serious because we are not talking about goods but about real life and the quality of peoples' lives.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1665711">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document> and, at the same time, to see the Bloc Québécois, which accuses us of siding with the Conservatives, siding so strongly with the Liberals, the grandmasters of EI cuts. I was listening to the member for <Affiliation DbId="128521" Type="2">Dartmouth—Cole Harbour</Affiliation> talk about how discriminatory this bill was, how it does not help all people, all workers. He was wondering how the government could be doing so little in a piece of legislation put forward during times of economic crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665712">I do not want to speak only of the Liberals in my speech, but I recall that, in 1996, there was a crisis in the fisheries industry in the Gaspé, in New Brunswick and throughout Atlantic Canada. This industry was going through a crisis, and that was when we experienced the worse cuts to employment insurance. Strangely enough, at the time, the Liberals were not concerned about discrimination. In some places, 700 hours of work were required, and in others, 420 hours. Claimants were all workers, good hard-working people. Yet, there were different classes of workers. In some regions, in spite of having worked more hours, workers did not qualify for EI. It is funny how we did not hear anything about discrimination at that time. This morning, however, all we are hearing about is discrimination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665713">Ask me the following questions and ask them of the NDP. Does the bill go far enough? Absolutely not, not at all. This is not an NDP bill. It is a government bill. We have looked at the bill. Are we happy with it? Absolutely not. We are not happy with it. Is the employment insurance system the same for everyone? Did the Liberals vote with us on the 360 hour standard of eligibility? They never did when in power. Did the Liberals approve the 12 best weeks formula when in power? Of course not. We have seen people suffer in our region because of the cuts to EI. Who has made EI what it is today? They should not come and suggest today that the current economic crisis is to blame. We had an economic crisis in our region at those days, and the human resources minister was from Atlantic Canada. It was one of our own who, as a minister, made cuts to EI. If we want to talk about discrimination, there has been discrimination in the past and there is still discrimination today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665714"> But can we say no to a particular group? I know the Bloc Québécois is pressing the question of whether it is $1 billion and 190,000 people. I hope we will never reach that number. I hope that people will not lose their jobs. I hope they will not need to claim employment insurance benefits. But what am I going to tell people back home, when last week, Aliant said it was closing its doors in Bathurst and Shippagan? What am I going to tell people back home, when TNS Canadian Facts, another call centre company, has announced this morning that it is closing down in Bathurst? These are people who have worked there a long time and are not eligible for employment insurance. If we do this, at least, people will be entitled to benefits. Their benefits will be extended. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665715"> I am certain that Quebec is not exempt from this. There is an economic crisis in Quebec as much as anywhere else. When the Bloc Québécois member says that Quebec and Quebeckers are being ignored, that is not true. This is not a bill put forward by the NDP. We are not ignoring them. There is a bill and there are people in Quebec who are going to have the chance to receive benefits. The fewer unemployed, the better it will be, just as it is where I come from.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665716"> How can we say no to these people? Some will say that we have opposed certain employment insurance measures at certain times. Yes, we said no to certain changes to employment insurance when they were part of budgets, when the government wanted to freeze public service salaries, freeze RCMP salaries, when they told women they would not be able to go to court if they wanted pay equity. When we looked at the budget, yes, we voted against it because it was a bad budget that was going to harm other people. In this case, yes, there are people who are not receiving benefits and we would like them to receive benefits. Yes, I would like the people back home, the seasonal workers, to be able to receive employment insurance. Yes, they have been working for years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665717"> Last week I spoke with a woman from Prince Rupert who is a union representative. She explained that the same thing is happening where she comes from as where I come from. There are closings in the fish plants and closings in the fishery. It is the same problem. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1665718"> How many times have we voted on bills in this House when they were not for the benefit of all Canadians? For the five additional weeks we voted on three or four years ago, that was only because the unemployment rate was at a certain level. Not everyone was entitled to the five additional weeks. When we went for the 14 best weeks, not all Canadians, and not all Quebeckers, received that. At that time, the Bloc Québécois voted for the measure. It was discriminatory, everyone should have known that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665719">Today, we have a bill that can help a group of people. This is what we must vote on, and the decision we must make is whether or not we will grant that help. The Bloc Québécois has decided to vote against the bill. That is their right, and I respect that. The Liberals have decided not to help long-tenured workers, people who have worked for whatever number of years is required in the bill. They will not support it. That is right. The NDP has decided that even if there is not much money, we can still take it out of the EI fund to give to these workers. I would prefer to give the workers this money than to leave it in the consolidated revenue fund, where the EI fund's $57 billion surplus is found. That is what the vote will be on. Do we want this money to be taken out of the consolidated revenue fund, where it went in the big Ottawa theft from the EI fund, and given to certain workers?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665720">The Canadian Labour Congress appeared before the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities and made it very clear. The president, Ken Georgetti, very clearly said that he was not happy, but that he still wanted us to vote in favour of the bill. He said that his members across the country are in need, and that is why he does not want us to vote against the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665721"> The Quebec labour unions also appeared. The FTQ representative said that instead of a bill, it could have been a pilot project. He was not very happy it was a bill and was not in favour of it. A pilot project would have been just as discriminatory as a bill. I fail to see the difference. People can go and read the blues, the record of the discussions. He said it very clearly. He said it should have been a pilot project. I asked him what that would change. He told me he would not have had to come here and argue about something that was not going to happen anyway. He was not really opposed to working people getting it. When he said it could have been a pilot project, I inferred that would have been acceptable. The government certainly could have decided to have a pilot project. That would have been faster. It would have been done and finished, as they have with other bills. But we do not have a pilot project today, we have a bill. We are stuck with saying yes or no. The Liberals took a $57 billion surplus from the employment insurance fund in 1996. They are the ones who made this change during an economic crisis in the Atlantic region. There was then and still is an economic crisis there. When someone asks whether we have been affected by the economic crisis, we say we have been in it for 100 years. We know all about it. This is not the first time we have been mistreated by the Liberals or the Conservatives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665722"> The biggest mistake in the employment insurance system was back in 1986 when the government decided to take the EI money and put it into the consolidated revenue fund. Employment insurance has been the government’s cash cow ever since. Who is dependent on employment insurance? It is not working people any more, it is the government, because there are big surpluses in it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665723"> Is the NDP ashamed to vote in favour of this bill? Not at all. It will not do anyone any harm and will help some people in Quebec, New Brunswick, Ontario and British Columbia. Does it go far enough? No, it does not. The NDP has bills calling for 360 hours, the best 12 weeks, getting rid of the two week waiting period, and giving employees 60% of their salaries. These are bills that have been tabled by the NDP and we have more of them. We have 12 of them, while the Bloc Québécois has only 6. Does Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document> go far enough? No. Will it help working people? Yes, and the NDP is proud to vote in favour of this bill.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1665733">The Bloc Québécois leader is not in a position to stand up and say that he called for changes to employment insurance and got them. I do not think that the Bloc has anything to boast about. Maybe the Bloc feels sad that it did not get anything for Quebec workers. Maybe it feels jealous that the NDP did. Maybe that is what they find so disheartening. Maybe that is why my Bloc colleague is feeling so discouraged.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665734">But maybe he doesn't feel that way because he is glad that the NDP will be voting for this bill. Maybe he would be upset if the NDP voted against it. He would be terribly upset if the NDP said no to all those Quebec workers. That is why he is glad that he can hide behind the NDP and not vote for the bill because the NDP will vote for it. That way, his party can keep up its NDP-bashing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665735">Maybe it would be better if, instead of talking to unions, the Bloc talked to workers who have no money and whose benefits are about to run out. We want to give these people up to 20 extra weeks of employment insurance benefits. Maybe the Bloc should talk to workers. Maybe it should talk to a single mother who has lost her job and has no money for her kids. Maybe it should ask her if she thinks that Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document> is a good idea. I am sure that she would tell my colleague that he is making a terrible mistake.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1665746">Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak to the House about a technical amendment we would like to make to Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document>. We are seeking to establish a fixed date of January 4, 2009 for eligibility. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665747">This is our government's proposed legislation to temporarily extend employment insurance regular benefits for unemployed long-term workers. Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document> would give these workers additional weeks of employment insurance while they look for jobs. In the original draft of the legislation, the start date for eligibility was tied to the date of royal assent. However, if royal assent is delayed for any reason, there could be a negative impact on employment insurance clients. That would be unfair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665748">To ensure that long-tenured workers can get all of their additional weeks of EI regular benefits regardless of timing of royal assent, we are proposing to establish January 4, 2009 as the only eligibility date. We would then remove the reference to an alternate timeframe of nine months prior to the coming into force of the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665749">This would ensure that all long-tenured workers who lost their jobs in 2009 would be eligible for additional weeks of benefits, regardless of the length of time needed to approve the bill. We estimate that about 190,000 Canadian workers would benefit from these measures. The establishment of a fixed date would not affect the ability of long-tenured workers to claim extended benefits until September 11, 2010, nor would it affect the payment of these extended benefits into the fall of 2011.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665750">Let me explain. For example, Jason has been working in a plant manufacturing cars for the past 15 years. At the beginning of 2009, there was a drastic reduction in demand and by January 9, he had lost his job. He applied for EI and was entitled to receive EI regular benefits until December 11. Because of the fixed date of January 4 eligibility, Jason would be eligible to receive additional weeks of anywhere from five to 20 weeks under Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665751">Long-tenured workers have worked hard and paid taxes. They have paid their EI premiums. It is only right and fair that we should help them during this temporary downturn. Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document> is a temporary measure designed to give those long-tenured workers the support they need to rebuild their lives. Our hope is that their fortunes will improve as the economy recovers. In the meantime, we want to make these extra weeks of benefits available to eligible workers as soon as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665752">There would be a gradual transition back to the normal terms and conditions. Beginning in June 2011, the level of additional benefits would be reduced in five-week increments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665753">We want to make these extended benefits available to as many unemployed long-term workers as possible and we want to get them access as soon as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665754">I ask members of the House to show their support for Canadian workers by backing these amendments. This is just an example of what the Conservative government has done to help unemployed workers. It shows that we are willing to get down to work and make the necessary changes that are required in this global downturn.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665755">I go back to my riding of <Affiliation DbId="128539" Type="2">Prince Albert</Affiliation> and look at the people there. When I come to Ottawa and represent them, I look at the things we have done as a government that have helped benefit those people.

              <ParaText id="1665759">Members may recall that when all of this subject matter about helping people as a consequence of the financial crisis was raised, we were talking about the 360 hour threshold for being able to collect benefits.

              <ParaText id="1665760">The minister herself has said time and time again that these benefits for these industries were supposed to be available for all Canadians, yet now it is very clear that they are not.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1665762">Mr. Speaker, it is a good question. However, the reality is these benefits are available to all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665763">If someone has been working, let us say, in an auto plant or another industry for a number of years and for no reason of his or her own the plant shuts down, the amendment to the bill would allow that individual to access unemployment insurance for an extended period of time, to allow the person to go into workforce, to find a job that fits his or her needs and helps the family. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665764">Look at what we are doing for Canadians. I am amazed by the economic action plan. The best way to help unemployed Canadians, their families and the economy is to help them get back to work. That is our number one priority and we are doing that. We are not playing politics or trying to force the government to fall for an unnecessary election like my Liberal colleagues are trying to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665765">We have added an additional five weeks and 300,000 Canadians have benefited from that. Work-sharing projects have assisted 165,000 Canadians. These are examples of the things we are doing to help Canadians in this time of global recession.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665766">We froze EI premiums for two years so employers and employees could keep their money. We provided an additional $60 million to help older workers because they have invaluable knowledge and experience and lots of potential remaining. That is very true.

              <ParaText id="1665769">In circumstances where Canadians have lost approximately 500,000 full-time jobs since last fall under the stewardship of the Conservative government, help is obviously needed in the economy for these workers. Blame is not the issue. People are unemployed and they need help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665770">My question is twofold.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665771"> First, why is it fair to distinguish between what the Conservatives would call good or long-tenured workers as opposed to people who do not fit in this category? The Conservatives are essentially rewarding long-tenured workers who are now unemployed and not helping everybody else. What does he think about that?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665772">Second, as an example, there is no help whatsoever for seasonal workers, such as people in the fishery or forestry industries. Some of the most hard-hit industries are getting nothing from this legislation. I am sure, being a person of good conscience, he must agree this is simply wrong.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1665774">One thing about being in government is that one wants to be responsible. When I speak to people in my riding, they want to ensure we treat unemployed people responsibly. They actually like the idea that if people have been paying EI premiums for 15 years, they should get a little more benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665775">I am sure the hon. member would agree. Why would he be treated the same if he has been paying premiums for 15 years as the guy who has been working for only a year? There has to be a little give and take in the system and that is what we are doing. We are allowing older workers to get jobs and giving them a bit more time to find proper jobs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665776">The member is sincere when he says we should not be playing politics, but in question period or any other time in the House, that is exactly what is going on. In the agriculture committee, all the member for <Affiliation DbId="128358" Type="2">Malpeque</Affiliation> does is play politics.

              <ParaText id="1665777">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate on Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document> and the three report stage motions on today's order paper. Substantively, Motions Nos. 2 and 3 are fairly straightforward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665778">The first motion deals with a royal recommendation as well as a change to the number of weeks. The benefit period that determines the weeks required would be changed from what was originally debated by this place back at second reading before the bill went to committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665779">I thought it would be useful to make a couple of comments about Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document> itself. Its genesis was to take into account the fact that extraordinary things happened in certain industries across the country, some more different than others, for instance, the forestry sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665780">The forestry sector, because it relies so heavily on seasonal work similar to the fisheries sector, relies on the EI system to complement its working availability. Similarly, the auto industry. If the auto industry needs to retool or rework the factory for new models or for changes in models or whatever, it relies on the employment insurance system to provide a continuity of income under the plan to fulfill its purposes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665781">The petroleum industry, though, is a bit different. It does not rely on a ready and available workforce because it has down times and up times. The petroleum industry, particularly in the west, has grown enormously. We can see that by the shift in population, the demand for housing, the rise in prices of housing and all kinds of other things that happen. It had a very the stable workforce.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665782">When the crunch came and the price of oil went down, all of a sudden there was this exodus of people from the petroleum industry. These people are the ones who will benefit the most from Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document>. Most of them are long service employees. The bill will get them more benefits than they would have otherwise been entitled to receive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665783">Table 1 in the legislative briefing notes lays out the level of benefits that people could get. Someone in the seven to ten year group would get five weeks. The table goes right up to 12 to 15 years. Someone in that group would get an extension of benefits of about 20 weeks. That is pretty substantial. There are a number of categories but I will not go into them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665784">This was basically to look at employees who had served for a long period of time, were not regular claimants of EI, and for no reason of their own had been laid off. This would allow a super benefit, as it were, during a certain period. The amendments under report stage Motions Nos. 2 and 3 indicate that the benefit period would begin on January 4. The benefit period would be retroactive to that date rather than when the bill actually received royal assent. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665785">I asked a question earlier of an hon. member about the whole EI discussion. A special task force was established between the official opposition and the government to look at some of these questions. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1665786">It really concerns me that there was a void of information coming from the government representatives to the task force as to the kinds of things at which we could look. The task force was looking at the 360 hour eligibility base. If people got 360 hours within the time prescribed, they would qualify for benefits. It also was looking at the costing. It was interesting to note that the 360 hour benefit period was summarily dismissed by the government members of the task force, the minister being one, because they said that the cost of implementing the benefit level was $4.4 billion, and it was just too much.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665787">We would think that the <Affiliation DbId="128694" Type="4">Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development</Affiliation>, who is responsible for the Employment Insurance Act and who has a full department of people who know much it costs for a certain level, would have the tools and the resources to know approximately how much it would cost if we were to change one of the variables. That was not the case. Subsequently we had some different assumptions. In fact, the cost of it would only be $2.5 billion. That is quite a bit different. That is $1.9 billion less than the Conservatives had said when they summarily dismissed the whole discussion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665788">Then after we got other third parties involved and the Parliamentary Budget Officer, and that is a whole story in itself, the estimates for introducing that level benefit came down to $1.3 billion compared to what the Conservatives initially said as being $4.4 billion. How can they be more than 300% off the actual cost of introducing those changes, when they are the government, when she is the minister, when she has a whole department and she knows exactly all the variables and how they work?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665789">It leads to a question of credibility, and I know a number of the other members who have been concerned about the bill have been concerned about the equity. We do not have unlimited dollars and we just cannot holus-bolus spread it around. However, the minister had said very clearly, and other members have affirmed this, that this benefit was to be provided for all Canadians. It was estimated that some 190,000 people would benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665790">When the members did their homework and when they started to look at the areas in which there was long service of employment but reliance on employment insurance benefits, some industries were more advantaged and others were not getting a fair share. This is the kind of thing that really concerns Canadians because they cannot trust the government to tell them the truth. It really comes down to that. This is exactly what the bill comes down to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665791">When I look at the charts and the various gradations, somebody has gone to a lot of work to make this more complicated than it should have been. If the real intent was to assist long-service workers who found themselves all of a sudden out of work for a protracted period of time and they had not been users of the system, there could have been a very simple approach to it, but there was not.

              <ParaText id="1665792">I know the premiers were on side to get these changes done, but the summer task force was totally shut down. The member for <Affiliation DbId="128521" Type="2">Dartmouth—Cole Harbour</Affiliation>, who was on the committee, told me what was happening. He said that when the government was ready, it set up a meeting and it was agreed that any of the proposals, any of the information that any party wanted the group to consider would have to be circulated to the members in advance. Not once did not happen. Every time the government members had something to submit, what did they do? They brought it and tabled it when the meeting started. They did not give anybody a chance to really understand what was there. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1665794">Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665795"> I must admit that, when the minister and the <Affiliation DbId="128683" Type="4">Minister of National Revenue</Affiliation> talked about it for the first time, in a press conference, I was rather shocked. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665796">It smacked of improvisation on the part of the Conservative government. Why? Purely and simply because it could have proposed something concerning EI in the budget brought down earlier in the year. What did we get? Zilch, zero, nothing. Sadly, the Liberals did not put any proposals forward. They simply made their own what the Bloc Québécois had done. The NDP, too, made further proposals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665797">In its economic recovery plan, the Bloc Québécois put forth a vision and ideas for unemployment insurance. There are great problems with EI, besides what the Liberals did during the mid-1990s. The Liberal members will argue that they were dealing with a totally different problem and that their action was justified. Unfortunately, we cannot go back in time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665798">It was totally irresponsible to plunder $57 billion from the employment insurance account. That $57 billion did not belong to the government; it belonged to the workers and employers who contributed to it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665799">The government has never put a single penny into that fund. It was a form of insurance, which is why it is called employment insurance. It is a contract between workers who pay into it, and employers who also contribute. So that money was there just for the workers. Since the economy was much more prosperous at the time, a surplus accumulated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665800">What was the first thing the Liberals did to wipe out their deficit, apart from passing it on to the provinces, as only they know how to do? They also plundered the employment insurance fund in order to balance their budget. Whenever we try to clean up this mess created by the Conservatives and the Liberals, we are not helping matters any by trying to always add more. That does not make things any better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665801">What the Bloc Québécois wanted was a complete overhaul of the EI system. We must make sure the government does not have complete control over the fund and that it cannot plunder it whenever it likes. I said earlier that it smacked of improvisation. However, what is even more improvised is the NDP's response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665802">I listened carefully to what the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128673" Type="2">Acadie—Bathurst</Affiliation> was saying earlier. I do not doubt his genuine desire to defend workers. Throughout his speech, he explained the many flaws in Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document>. Why is he supporting such a bad bill? I understand that an additional $1 billion is being spent on employment insurance, but when we look at the people who will be affected, we see that the NDP's response was sheer improvisation. It merely wants to prop up the government in order to stall for time for electoral reasons. Personally, I think that is the only reason. Why? Because when the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128673" Type="2">Acadie—Bathurst</Affiliation> was talking about it earlier, he was saying that there were some problems with seasonal workers, especially in his riding. As we know, many people in his riding work in the fishing industry, and that is seasonal work. This bill does absolutely nothing for those people. It does not help unemployed seasonal workers. That is the main problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665803">I do not understand why the NDP is supporting the Conservative government. In January, the Liberals were the Conservatives' new friends. Now we see that it is the NDP's turn. I find that sad. It sold its soul to the devil for peanuts. They could have at least tried to negotiate a little in order to get a bit more. They did nothing. The leader of the NDP is bragging that it is thanks to him that the unemployed got an additional $1 billion. I have a big problem with that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665804">The reason the Bloc Québécois is against this bill is that it does not help seasonal workers. Take people in the forestry sector, for example. These are people who labour hard in Quebec's forests to try to earn a living.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1665805">They will not get any additional help from Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document>. The bill says that claimants cannot have received employment insurance benefits during roughly the past five years. This is extremely complicated for people in the forestry or fishery sectors. There are many fishers in Rimouski and Rivière-du-Loup. Theirs is seasonal employment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665806">We see that the Conservatives have done a lot of improvising and so has the NDP. It was a vaudeville act. It is unfortunate that the Conservatives never gave us any figures in terms of the unemployed who would benefit from this in Quebec. They are not even able to tell us how many unemployed people in Quebec will be affected by this bill. There is a reason for that and it is pure electioneering. This will help workers in the auto industry. It will help people in Ontario. It will help regions where the Conservatives want to make gains in the next election. We saw that they injected $10 billion into the automobile industry. I do not have a problem with them injecting $10 billion into the automobile industry. In fact, they are injecting an additional $1 billion for unemployed people who are connected to the auto industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665807">However, I have a problem with the fact that, in these times, there is absolutely nothing for Quebec. The unemployed in Quebec are given nothing. That is the problem. I often explain the main reasons why I am a sovereignist. This is another good reason. The member for <Affiliation DbId="128539" Type="2">Prince Albert</Affiliation> said that, when he returned to his riding, people were pleased. When I went back to my riding, people told me to vote against the bill because it does not help Quebec. That is why Quebec unions are against this bill. That is why the Sans-Chemise are against it. The reason is simple. Quebeckers quickly realized that this bill will not help any of our workers because it is tailor-made for the Ontario auto sector. That is the main problem with Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665808">I was saying earlier that the NDP improvised on this one. What really makes me mad is that the NDP puts on such a show about being the great champions of the unemployed, those who do not have jobs, and yet we see that this will have no impact in Quebec. It will have very little impact in the Atlantic provinces because most jobs there are seasonal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665809">I am being told that I only have two minutes left but I could have gone on for hours having realized that this bill was just cobbled together. If the Conservatives really wanted to do something for the unemployed, they would have done it in the budget. They would have introduced bills well before this. They would have tried to speed up the process a little and introduced bills in January and February. We have known for months, even a year, that we are in a recession. The Conservatives have woken up one year later and, all of a sudden, introduced a bill that will not help anyone in our ridings. I do not believe anyone in my riding will be offended when I vote against this bill. On the contrary, as I took part in a great number of activities in my riding, my constituents have let me know that this is a bad bill that does not help Quebeckers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1665811">He clearly stated that the Bloc Québécois is against this bill.

The amendment in Motion No. 1 would reduce that number even further.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665812">I asked around in my riding and other ridings too. Nobody would benefit from this bill. Apparently the same is true for his riding. Can he comment on that? Has anyone called him or visited his office to ask him to vote for this bill?</ParaText>

That is not surprising because he worked in the labour sector for years, and nobody understands the needs of unemployed workers better than he does. For years, he has been doing great work with the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities. He is truly amazing, because even the minister herself does not know her own department's numbers even though they are right there on the website. The member for Chambly—Borduas needs to explain them to her. Does she even know what she is talking about? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665815">The problem is that the Conservatives are coming up with these feel-good bills that will not change a thing out in the real world. That is because they want to cut back on government interference, get rid of it. Of course they want to cut benefits. The problem with cutting benefits is that our people are the ones who end up suffering.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="128868" Type="18">Mr. Pierre Lemieux (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1665823">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today to Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document> at report stage. This is the Conservative government's bill that will amend the Employment Insurance Act to increase employment insurance benefits for long-tenured employees. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1665824">In particular, I will be talking about the technical amendment. The amendment ensures that long-tenured workers, already receiving EI regular benefits when royal assent is obtained, have sufficient room in their benefit period to receive all of their additional benefits. We have added this amendment because we want to ensure that all long-tenured workers benefit from the additional weeks provided by the bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665825">Bill C-50 was brought on by a particularly severe global recession that led to serious cutbacks in production and workers losing their jobs. In particular, it has tended to affect workers who have held down jobs for many years, often in a single industry or who face difficult prospects of getting back into the workforce. These long-tenured workers have done their jobs and they have done them well. They have paid their taxes and EI premiums, and they have not known what it was like to have been laid off or to be looking for another job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665826">What is really quite unsettling is that for many of them their benefits are fast running out and that is what Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document> is all about. It is about treating workers who have worked long and hard with respect. It is helping them out in their time of need. Bill C-50 would provide from 5 to 20 weeks of additional EI regular benefits depending on circumstances and individual eligibility. In so doing, this initiative would provide these individuals with extra time to find alternative employment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665827">The amendment before the House would make certain that if they are receiving or have recently exhausted their regular benefits when the bill finally receives royal assent, they would have sufficient time to receive all their additional benefits under Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document>. This will benefit long-tenured workers from all sectors of the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665828">Long-term workers make up about one-third of those who have lost their jobs across Canada since the end of January and who have established an EI claim. Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document> provides valuable extra time for workers who must now look for a new job. To be unemployed can be a terrible shock for someone who was not expecting it after years and years on the job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665829">To ensure that workers benefit from this measure regardless of the timing of royal assent, this new provision would establish a fixed date of January 4, 2009 for eligibility. Given that the measure would be available to new long-tenured claimants up to September 11, 2010, this means payment of these extended benefits would continue until the fall of 2011. It is estimated that this temporary measure under Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document> would ultimately benefit about 190,000 long-tenured workers.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1665830"> The amendments to Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document> and Bill C-50 as a whole are part of the great economic action plan for Canada. In short, our economic action plan contains measures to help all unemployed Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665831"> Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document> tells long-tenured employees that they deserve these extra weeks to help them take charge of their lives, because they have contributed so much to their former employers and now find themselves without work for the first time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665832"> We are focusing our efforts on what is important to Canadians; we are helping those most affected by the recession; and we are investing in training and job creation. We have taken a lot of measures. The best way to help the unemployed and their families is to revive the economy and help Canadians return to work. This is our top priority. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665833"> Additional measures have been put in place for long-tenured employees. They are the Canadians who have paid premiums for many years and are having difficulty finding new jobs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665834"> So, Canadians are benefiting from the measures included in the economic action plan. There were, for example, other measures that I will mention now. We added an extra five weeks to employment insurance, something that will help 300,000 Canadians. Job sharing has made it possible to protect the jobs of 165,000 Canadians. Freezing the EI contribution rate means that employers have more money and can create more jobs and that Canadians can keep more of their hard-earned income. Our measures include the payment of an additional $60 million to older workers, because they have inestimable knowledge and potential we must continue to tap. Finally, investments have been made to ensure that Canadians get benefits in a timely manner. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665835"> For all these reasons, I call on my colleagues to join me in voting in favour of Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document>. </ParaText>

There are some good measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665847">I would like to ask my colleague with respect to his particular riding, the good riding of Glengarry—Prescott—Russell, if our vast suite of employment measures have been helpful, and how are these measures affecting his constituents in his particular riding?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1665848">Mr. Speaker, certainly my riding, as the ridings of most MPs, has being affected by the economic difficulties which we find ourselves in. The town of Hawkesbury, for example, is a town that is centred on manufacturing, and has had plant closures and layoffs. PGW is in the process of shutting down. Ivaco has undergone many layoffs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665849">To answer my colleague's question, Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document> is a very important measure for those Canadians who have worked all their lives or much of their lives in one job. In addition to the 190,000 Canadians that we are going to help, those long-tenured Canadians, we have undertaken other measures to help employment insurance help Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665850">We have extended EI by five weeks. This is helping 300,000 Canadians. We have expanded work-sharing. Work-sharing is used in my riding by businesses. We are helping to protect 165,000 jobs across the country. We have frozen EI premiums, for example. This leaves more money in the pockets of both employees and employers, definitely a benefit for Canadians in my riding and Canadians in every MP's riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665851">Again, I must encourage the Liberals to support our government in all of these measures but particularly with Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document>. They should stop obstructing positive bills like this that will help Canadians in these difficult times.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1665852">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity today to put a few thoughts on the table about this very important piece of public business before us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665853">I want to remind folks that there are actually two issues at play in this debate. One is whether we want to have another election, which has been spoken of and is being spoken of with great trepidation and fear by certainly many of my constituents and others across this country. The other one that is rooted in this bill is the question of whether we want to move the yardsticks on EI.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665854">When I spoke at second reading on this bill a few weeks ago, I called on the House at that time to work to find a way to, in a common cause, do the best that we could in the interest of protecting people out there who are really feeling the hurt of this recession that we have all been part of for quite some time now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665855">I asked the different parties, the government party, the official opposition, the Bloc, and ourselves, to work together in the interests of workers and those families affected by people losing their jobs, hundreds of thousands of jobs. These jobs are not returning and many communities are still reeling, still wondering what they are going to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665856">This recession, even though it may not feel like it in here, at times, is still very real out there. When we go back to our constituencies, the people we run into on the street or in the coffee houses will tell us that it has not let up and the impact is very real.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665857">So, what has happened since then? How has the House responded to that request, to that plea by myself and members of my caucus to try to find some common cause?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665858">Well, the Conservatives, the government party, put $1 billion on the table for some part of the unemployed work community. It is not everything that we wanted. It is not everything that obviously the Bloc and the Liberals wanted. However, it is certainly a lot more than the Liberals themselves got in their discussions with the Conservatives over this past summer when they met several times over a very important piece of work on behalf of families and workers and communities out there. They came away empty-handed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665859">What the Liberals decided, because they could not get any movement, any agreement from the Conservatives on this important issue, was that they wanted, instead, to have an election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665860">I say the time for an election has passed, at this particular juncture. The time for an election, in my view, was last January, when all of us in the opposition benches lost confidence in the government. What the government had tabled at the end of November, the beginning December in this House, was such an insult not only to us who come to work here, who understood the depth and the breadth of this recession that was coming at us, but certainly to the people of Canada. There was nothing in that package, absolutely nothing, that reflected that the government understood that we were in difficult economic times. Those difficult economic times were extraordinary in nature, akin to, some at that time said, the dynamics of the Great Depression. People were actually then beginning to lose their jobs and lose value in their pensions as well as all of the other ways that this recession has come to affect and hurt many working families and communities across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665861">We certainly led the charge at that time and offered to make the leader of the official opposition the prime minister, by way of the coalition. Those who took the time at that particular juncture to look at the package that we had put on the table, by way of a program for the new government, would have recognized that it included the changes that both the Liberals and the Bloc were expecting would happen by this, I guess, offering by the government to reform EI. It was all there.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1665862">We have not been shy to talk about the different efforts we have made by way of opposition day motions and by way of bills tabled in the House to reform EI to more adequately reflect the needs people have for support in their time of difficulty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665863">Here we are halfway across the river. People are really struggling. When I went back home in September of this year after the Liberals announced that they were going to bring the government down and cause an election, people said to me very clearly that that was not the time for an election. That was not the time to be spending $300 million on an election which the polls showed--and yes polls change during elections--would simply result in our ending up back here with a similar makeup of government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665864">When I go back to my riding even today people say to me “no election; this is not the time”. They say to me, “Tony, go back to Ottawa and see if you can find a way to work together to get something done”. People are asking because they are paying attention to what is going on here. They are asking me when Bill <Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document> is going to pass, because they are at a place in their working life, and the recession is having an impact on them such that they will need the extra benefit that will come to them when this bill is passed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665865">One billion dollars is a lot of money. That fact may not have been reflected in the input that we heard this morning from either the Liberals or the Bloc, but I have to say that one billion dollars, however short it may fall of the total amount that is needed in terms of reform to EI, will help a lot of people at a time when they need it most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665866">As we keep the government going for the short term, we are also told that there will be legislation coming forward this week to reform EI for self-employed individuals. There are a number of people in my riding who are self-employed, who own small businesses, who are struggling just as those who work in big industry are, and they are concerned because they have no safety net. They are asking us to work with government to create a safety net that would give them some assistance when they need it, as they look ahead and see that things do not look so great for them either.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665867">I am also hearing via the media that the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> is indicating a willingness to do something on pensions and is actually talking about the very good recommendations and ideas that the NDP are bringing forward and putting on the table with regard to pension reform. We look forward to having that discussion with the government to see if we can find some common ground so that we can give some sense of confidence to people who are either looking at retirement or living in retirement on pensions that in fact those pensions will be improved and protected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665868">A time for an election will come, perhaps next spring after a budget is tabled, but this is not the time. Today we need to pass Bill<Document DbId="4097002" Type="3">C-50</Document> so that one billion dollars can be put out the door and made available to workers who have lost their jobs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1665917">Digitalization, with its profuse social networking, is now the most used, watched and participatory medium in history. Twenty-first century media in all of its forms is a most powerful influencer, so educating the public to understand the nature, techniques and impacts of media messaging is imperative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665918">Media messaging is not pure. It is influenced by commercial interests, competition for viewership and ideology. Images and comments vie for attention daily and manipulating the image and the message is tempting. Time limitations that demand simplistic sound bites for complex messages can lead to stereotyping. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665919">The power of the media is evidenced by many young women who measure themselves by an anorexic and unreal media image of beauty, and social networking among youth can sometimes be used to destroy reputations in perpetuity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1665920">The media is an important cultural and informative tool. Media literacy can help us probe, analyze and develop the critical thinking skills necessary to interpret and appropriately value media's social, cultural and political implications.</ParaText>

It was important to complete the regular flu vaccine because every year, on average, 4,000 Canadians die of the regular flu.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666190">In 2007, Revenue Canada, the tax court, determined that only 25% of retirement benefits should be applied to the capital gains tax formula. However, 100% of the revenue was in fact taxed, leaving 850 fishers, 798 from Newfoundland and Labrador and 52 from the Quebec north shore, unfairly treated by the Government of Canada. There are 150 fishers who followed the recommendation of DFO at the time. They had their taxes treated fairly, and therefore each saved, on average, about $20,000.</ParaText>

Unlike debt holders, banks and suppliers, they are not diversified businesses taking risks and having access to tax writeoffs for financial loss.

              <ParaText id="1666207">The petitioners believe a serious lack of competition and transparency in the energy industry has hampered the free market to the detriment of all Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666209">The petitioners also wish to draw to the attention of the government and the House of Commons that many countries around the world have an energy market monitoring agency and that energy superpowers like Canada need such an agency. They therefore call upon Parliament to finally acknowledge that the high price of fuel is damaging to the Canadian economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666210">They ask for the reinstatement of the Office of Petroleum Price Information, which was abolished by the government in 2006 as an energy market information service similar to the U.S. energy information agency, and they also wish to begin hearings in the energy sector to determine how the government can foster competition and provide transparency in the energy market to eliminate the monopolistic efficiencies defence clause of the Competition Act.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666247">At the outset, I would like to put this bill in the broader context of a global digital economy. In a little more than a decade the Internet has become a powerful factor in the competitiveness of the Canadian economy. It is an essential feature in all of our daily lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666248"> Digital media is poised to transform the economy and our society in ways that we have not yet imagined. It will increase in importance as an engine for economic growth. Worldwide the digital media sector is expected to grow to U.S. $2.2 trillion over the next five years. There is enormous potential and Canada must tap that potential, but Canada has lost ground over the past decade. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666249">When the Internet was new, Canada was at the forefront. We were the first country in the world to connect our schools and libraries to the Internet, for example. We were at the forefront of redesigning our framework laws to acknowledge the new technology. We led in the deployment and uptake of broadband. Our ICT companies were among the world leaders. But we have fallen behind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666250">As we have gone into this global economic slowdown, several commentators have talked about how Canada will lead the way out of it. The OECD and the IMF have talked about Canada leading the way out of this global recession. The World Economic Forum recently said that Canada will be one of only two industrialized countries to come out in a more competitive position than we went into this global slowdown.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666251">Our falling behind in terms of our ICT laws and legislation puts this progress and increased competitiveness at risk. This pattern is deeply disturbing. To remain at the forefront of a global economy where digital technologies and competencies are increasingly important, we must reverse this slide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666252">We need to reboot our national strategy for remaining competitive in that economy. Given the complexity of the digital economy, we need to move on many fronts. We are consulting on how best to achieve this to realize its benefits for the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666253">We want to grow the ICT sector to be an even larger share of our economy, because it is a source of high-paying jobs and high R and D intensity. We need to increase the smart use of ICTs in the other 95% of the economy to make them more efficient and profitable, from public services through manufacturing and service industries and natural resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666254">We need to close the productivity gap with the United States and increase our global competitiveness through the smart use of these technologies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666255">These goals rely on certain fundamentals, such as a high-speed network infrastructure and an online marketplace that has the trust and confidence of consumers and firms. We are working closely as a government with businesses to encourage sectors and firms to use information and communications technology more effectively.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666256">Even as we wrestled with the worst economic crisis in a generation, Canada's economic action plan targeted a number of specific actions to energize the ICT sector. All told, nearly $1.5 billion was devoted to this effort. Among those initiatives was $225 million to provide broadband coverage to unserved Canadians. This money will leverage additional investment to expand access for many Canadians to important economic and social benefits, including online health services, business opportunities and distance learning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666257">Our action plan also provided a 100% capital cost allowance rate for computer hardware and systems software for two years, which is helping companies realize the benefits of adopting new ICT solutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666258">These investments are part of a much broader agenda to put Canada once more at the forefront of the digital age, but we will not do this by investment alone. Government has a responsibility to create the economic conditions that will help build the digital economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666259">One of the ways we are doing this is by creating the right framework laws to build trust and confidence in online transactions and communications. Rules that counter unsolicited email are critical to that framework.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="35">(1535)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1666260">Spam represents between 80% and 90% of email traffic around the world. It is estimated that a total of 62 trillion spam emails were sent last year. This bill is about removing a major barrier to electronic commerce. Canadians see spam as a major problem. The Canadian business community sees it as an impediment to productivity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666261">Spam is more than a nuisance. When unsolicited emails, websites and even freeware programs such as screen savers contain viruses or other forms of malicious programs, they inflict considerable damage and undermine the confidence of consumers in the electronic marketplace. They discourage businesses from relying on the Internet to reach their customers in new markets. This is harmful at the best of times, but it is particularly damaging during an economic downturn. More people go online to look for job opportunities or the best deals and better ways to manage their finances. It is in these tough economic times that consumers are most susceptible and more likely to fall for the get-rich-quick schemes offered on various websites.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666262">More than ever, we need to maintain consumer trust and confidence in an online marketplace as a tool to help build the economy and eliminate deceptive marketing practices that can cause grave economic harm to Canadians. Spam and related threats impose heavy costs on network operators and users. They threaten network reliability and security and they undermine personal privacy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666263">Canada is the only G8 country and one of only four OECD countries without legislation dealing with online threats, such as spam, spyware, computer viruses, fraudulent websites and the harvesting of electronic addresses. These electronic intrusions are unacceptable. Some invade privacy and some are used to infect and gain control over computers. Most Internet service providers use filters to try to screen out spam. These filters tie up bandwidth and slow the system down. Even with these defences, spam still manages to get through.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666264">One of the best ways to combat spam is through effective legislation. Bill <Document DbId="3822532" Type="3">C-27</Document> puts in place important provisions that would protect Canadian consumers and businesses from the most damaging and deceptive forms of electronic harm. It provides a regulatory regime to promote compliance and protect the privacy and personal security of Canadians in the online environment. It provides a clear set of rules that will benefit all Canadians. It will encourage confidence in online communications and e-commerce.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666265">This bill combats spam and related online threats in two ways. It provides regulatory powers to administer monetary penalties and it gives individuals and businesses the right to sue spammers. Bill C-27 makes use of the federal trade and commerce power rather than the law enforcement authorities in the Criminal Code. A civil administrative regime such as that in the ECPA is consistent with the approach taken internationally. The law will be enforced by the CRTC, the Competition Bureau and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666266">A significant responsibility for enforcing the bill falls to the CRTC, which has a mandate to ensure the reliability, safety and effective operation of telecommunications networks in Canada. This includes the Internet. The CRTC will enforce the provisions against sending unsolicited commercial messages and will have responsibility for the provisions that prohibit the altering of transmission data without authorization.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666267">It will further prohibit the surreptitious installation of programs on computer systems and networks by requiring consent for the installation of all computer programs. In this way, we can help stem the flow of malicious computer programs such as spyware and key loggers. The Competition Bureau will also have responsibilities in stamping out spam under this bill. The bureau has a mandate to ensure fair marketplace practices for businesses and consumers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666268">The bill before us will extend the Competition Bureau's powers to address false and misleading representations online and deceptive marketplace practices such as false headers and website content. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada has responsibilities to protect personal information in Canada. This legislation will prohibit the collection of personal information without consent through unauthorized access to computer systems and the unauthorized compiling or supplying of lists of electronic addresses. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada will have the authority to enforce these provisions using its existing powers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666269">All of these are important elements in restoring confidence and trust in online communications.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="40">(1540)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1666270">The bill provides for administrative monetary penalties for those who violate the law by sending spam, making false and misleading representations in commercial electronic messages, installing spyware and viruses on computers, and for stealing personal information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666271">These laws have sharp teeth. For violation, the maximum administrative monetary penalty is $1 million for individuals, and up to $10 million for businesses. In this way, we provide government authorities with the power to fight spam and related online threats.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666272">The second way to fight spam is for consumers and businesses to combat spam to pursue a private right of action. This private right of action has been very effective in the United States. We heard much testimony during the course of the hearings. Obviously a lot of the research and a lot of the work that has gone into this has relied on efforts by other countries to address the very same issues that we are dealing with today. We have learned some things about what to do and what to put in the legislation. We also have learned some things about what maybe does not work so well in the legislation. We have had the advantage of looking at what other countries have done well and using that to inform our own legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666273">The private right of action will allow individuals and businesses that suffer financial harm an avenue of recourse to be compensated and awarded both actual and statutory damages. Network operators will be able to prosecute spammers in civil cases. This would allow them to take action against spammers that make use of their facilities without the threat of subsequent legal action from a spammer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666274">Whether through the regulatory agencies or the private right of action, our message to spammers is clear: We do not want them. We will not tolerate them, and if they try to operate in Canada, we will come after them either as private consumers and businesses or as regulatory authorities that make Canada a safe place to communicate and do business online.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666275">At the same time, I want to assure hon. members that legitimate businesses will not be negatively affected. The regime allows for consumer opt-in and some exceptions for implied consent so that legitimate businesses can continue to market through email.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666276">The Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology studied this bill very carefully. It heard from many witnesses, and as a result of some of the testimony, we introduced amendments to this bill. I want to emphasize that the government remains steadfast in its commitment to reduce spam and other computer-related threats that discourage the use of electronic commerce and that undermine privacy. It will protect both consumers and Canadian businesses from unwanted spam.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666277">As we saw during the debate at second reading in this House and as we saw in committee, there is widespread support for the spirit of this piece of legislation and what we are accomplishing. Canadian businesses know that spam costs them money, in the billions of dollars. In this House and in committee, we saw all parties support this legislation as well, and that is important to note. The time is due for this type of legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666278">At this time I would like to thank the members and senators from all parties who have helped make this bill more effective. I would remind this House that this bill has been guided also by the recommendations of the spam task force. We heard from many of the members of the task force as witnesses before the committee as we discussed this important legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666279">This legislation has also been inspired by the now retired senator Goldstein, when he introduced his bill in the other place. I would also like to recognize the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128252" Type="2">Pickering—Scarborough East</Affiliation> who has been a long-time champion of anti-spam legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666280">Finally, what I would like to do is assure this House that the bill before us is one step toward a much broader agenda for the digital economy. Our goal is to see a Canadian business climate and social climate that are innovative, adaptive and able to participate fully in the global digital economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666281">We as a government will continue to seek input and advice from stakeholders. We will reassert our leadership. As a necessary first step, we want to shut down the electronic threats that are such a source of concern to businesses and consumers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666282">The challenges are clear, but the potential is enormous. By getting this right, we can do more than simply participate in the digital economy; we can lead. But let us begin by joining our trading partners and neighbours in closing down the inappropriate and harmful use of Internet communications. Let us pass this bill as amended.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1666283">Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to my hon. colleague. The New Democratic Party has been pushing for some time to have a larger framework of understanding that innovation in the 21st century has to have a full, holistic view of where we go in terms of digital innovation. That is where the new economy rests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666284">I listened to a number of the issues my colleague brought forward, the need for broadband and to protect us from spammers and the criminal element that is out there to undermine digital innovation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666285">I was interested in his comments on how Canada has lost its way somewhat in terms of broadband. I am sure he has read the recent FCC report that just came out, which looks at the OECD countries. Canada has gone from a world leader just five years ago to a world laggard in key areas of innovation. We are paying some of the highest Internet rates in the world and getting some of the lousiest service. I do not think any Canadian consumer needs to confirm this. They know this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666286">The FCC points to the fact that the CRTC, although it does not mention the CRTC by name, talks about the lack of competition, the fact that there is a very small cabal of cable companies that see no interest in further innovation and expanding their broadband access. Therefore, we have a market that is stuck. People have to pay high fees. We get slower service. Competing countries are moving far ahead of us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666287">Since 2003 until 2009, the big change I have seen is the Conservative government has come to power. We have now gone from leader to laggard. What would the member tell the House to assure Canadian businesses and innovators that the government will get back on track and start to gain some of the ground that it has lost?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666288">Mr. Speaker, the hon. member points to one study. As usual, the study he chooses is probably the most negative one. There have been several studies and many of them point to leadership in terms of Canada's approach to digital issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666289">That said, obviously in this area, the area that the bill addresses, we have needed to do more. One of the challenges we have had, and we discussed this in committee at one point, was the fact that through successive minority governments, and we are in our third minority government situation, it is difficult to see legislation such as this pass through the entire process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666290">We saw a concern early on in this process, and that was we would wind up in an election and this bill would die before it could actually go through. This is why we urge members from all parties to ensure the legislation gets passed, as amended, gets on to the Senate and gets passed there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666291">On the issue of leadership and competitiveness, I would point out that in terms of the overall economy, the World Economic Forum just recently stated, and I stated this in my comments but I will highlight it again, that Canada would be one of only two industrialized countries to come out of this global recession in a more competitive position than we went in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666292">Legislation such as this to solidify our digital economy and to strengthen it can only help that circumstance. I encourage all members to pass this.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666294">The Internet first came into being about 15 years ago, and since then has grown exponentially, showing no signs of slowing down. We are all using the Internet more and more in our daily lives. It should enhance our productivity. We use it every day, whether to look for work, to shop, to communicate with our friends or to do business. We use it every day, yet there are still some barriers that prevent us from benefiting from the Internet's full potential.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1666295">Today, I would like to speak to Bill <Document DbId="3822532" Type="3">C-27</Document>. Simply put, Bill C-27 is an electronic commerce protection act that intends to prohibit sending of commercial electronic messages without the prior consent of recipients. This is what is more commonly known as spam email. The bill also looks to prohibit the use of false or misleading statements that disguise the origin or true intent of the email, the installation of unauthorized programs and the unauthorized collection of personal information or email addresses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666296"> Studies show that of the total email traffic that exists on the Internet today as much as 85% can be considered spam. The hon. member who spoke previously spoke of different levels. There is some as low as 60% and some as high as 90%. At any level, those levels are unacceptable and something has to be done to correct them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666297">When we consider the time that is spent sorting through in boxes and deleting unwanted email at work and at home, it does not take long to figure out that spam kills productivity.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1666298">How many times, whether at home or at work, have we started reading emails only to realize that many of them are unsolicited and cause problems? Such emails can make us waste half or a good part of our day. At any stage, these emails are a waste of time in terms of Canadian productivity.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1666299">A 2003 report estimated that fighting spam cost businesses and consumers $27 billion annually in information technology spending, including increased expenditures in the Internet bandwidth, the storage costs, anti-spam software and user support. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666300">This does not take into consideration the numerous hours that people waste just sorting through and finding out what they want, what they do not want, what they have asked for, what was sent to them without their request and getting rid of it. Again, it kills time that we could be using more productively as Canadians. It limits us from taking full advantage of the Internet, whether it is for personal or commercial purposes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666301">To say that spam is a serious problem to Canadians and Canadian business is an understatement. Spam is a large source of computer viruses, phishing programs designed for identity theft and deceptive and fraudulent business practices that target the vulnerable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666302">At these times, when the economy is faltering, when people are losing jobs and looking for hope, unscrupulous people are putting emails out there, putting ads on the Internet that are fictitious. They are causing problems. For people looking for somewhere to hang their hat, hang hope on something, what do they get? They lose their hard-earned money or what little they have left.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666303">In May 2004 the Liberal government recognized the danger of spam and established a task force to lead the anti-spam action plan for Canada. The task force held public consultations and led round tables with key stakeholders in the industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666304">In 2005 the task force tabled its report outlining 22 major recommendations, including key recommendations to strengthen legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666305">Specifically, the task force recommended Canada implement legislation to prohibit the sending of spam without prior consent of recipients and prohibit the use of false or misleading statements that disguised the origin or true intent of email, better known as phishing, prohibit the installation of unauthorized programs, otherwise known as spyware, and prohibit the unauthorized collection of personal information or email addresses. Bill <Document DbId="3822532" Type="3">C-27</Document> looks to implement these recommendations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666306">Bill <Document DbId="3822532" Type="3">C-27</Document> introduces fines for violation of the acts up to a maximum of $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses. It establishes rules for warrants, for information during investigations and injunctions on spam activity while under investigation. Bill C-27 also establishes the private right of action, allowing individuals and businesses the ability to seek damages from the perpetrators of spam.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666307">At committee stage, flaws were discovered in the original bill. Clause 6, for example, was found to have been written too broadly and could have suppressed some legitimate business communications over the Internet. Clause 8 also defined computer program very broadly and could have suppressed legitimate business software development and impeded legitimate Internet functions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666308">After considerable work, many amendments were made to the bill, refining measures for electronic messages, computer programs and the protection of privacy rights. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666309">The bill, however, maintains a very heavy-handed approach, which is not always the most effective approach. We looked at different options. We thought for now, with this broad, heavy-handed approach, which seems to be the way the Conservative government likes to do things, we would let it go through in the interest of protecting Canadians, with some options for modifications later on by the people who administer it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666310">Bill <Document DbId="3822532" Type="3">C-27</Document> takes a broad approach to defining a very wide definition of electronic messages that puts the onus on individual businesses to seek exceptions if they believe their activities to be legitimate. The proposed Liberal approach was to define known spam irritants as illegal, with the flexibility to add further definition as electronic messages on the Internet evolved. The concern with the Conservative approach is that an overly heavy-handed approach could stifle electronic commerce in Canada. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1666311">I want to remind Canadians that we want to look at the Internet as a tool that will make our lives better, more efficient and allow us to work more effectively. We have to be careful when a bill has a very wide span and catches everything. Overall, however, many changes were made to the bill at committee stage to make Bill <Document DbId="3822532" Type="3">C-27</Document> acceptable to the Liberal Party. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666312">We are pleased that the Conservative government has finally decided to act on the recommendation of our task force. At committee stage, many flaws were exposed in the bill and many changes were made. Is this bill perfect? Simply put, no. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666313">One of the areas that is still of concern and will continue to be monitored is the issue of materiality. Materiality comes up in clauses 71 and 73 of Bill <Document DbId="3822532" Type="3">C-27</Document>. The issue is under the Competition Act's new sections 54(1) and 74.01(1), which cover false and misleading representations. Bill <Document DbId="3822532" Type="3">C-27</Document> would make it a criminal offence or a reviewable practice under the Competition Act if sender information or subject matter information in an electronic message was false or misleading, regardless of whether it was false or misleading in a material respect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666314">The material respect standard is important to retain in respect of electronic sender information and subject matter information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666315"> First, it provides the Competition Bureau with the necessary discretion to brush aside complaints that are raised about purported misstatements that are trivial, and there are many of them, especially from business competitors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666316">Second, it provides businesses in Canada the comfort of knowing that an honest mistake in an electronic business communication that does not materially affect consumers will not automatically face potential criminal prosecution or civil action under the Competition Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666317">Third, it is a standard under the Competition Act that applies to representation that business makes in all other places, whether it be print, in store, radio, TV or, as we see here, in the body of an email.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666318">It is incorrect to say in advance that anything included in the sender information or subject matter information is always material. If it were correct, then including “in all material respect” could do absolutely no harm because any representation would still be caught as if “in a material respect” were not there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666319"> While the Liberal Party believes the bill remains unnecessarily heavy-handed in its approach, we would support the bill at third reading as action must be taken against spam.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666320">It is important that we continue to monitor the legislation closely going forward to ensure it does not stifle legitimate electronic commerce in Canada. The Liberal Party further notes that the fight against spam is much more than just legislation. The Liberal task force also recommended resources to be put toward coordinating enforcement of this law. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666321">Legislation will only go as far as the willingness to enforce the law. Will the government put the appropriate resources into enforcement? Will the government put resources into working with other nations to stamp out spam? Will the government dedicate resources to work with ISPs and Canadian business to establish the codes of practice? These questions will be answered in the fullness of time.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666322">Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to my hon. colleague. I was particularly interested because the issue of spam should be supported by all parties. Yet we have seen a number of articles that were written about the Liberal Party bringing forward a number of amendments that would seriously water down this bill, including an amendment to tighten up the provision on false subject headers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666323">The Liberals wanted to introduce a provision to limit the scope of spyware. There were motions being promoted by the copyright lobby to allow the surreptitiously installed DRM from being covered under the bill and an exception to a ban on the collection of personal information through any means of technology, if the collection was made by assessing a computer system or causing a computer system to be accessed without authorization. This would be in cases related to investigations, a breach of agreement or laws.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666324">The NDP was very clear in fighting spam and even the Conservatives, who tend to roll over for the lobbyists, at least were willing to hold the line, but the Liberals were the fifth columnists in bringing forward many motions that, fortunately, were voted down or they decided to pull at the last minute, which would have very much undermined this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666325">Would my hon. colleague tell me why the Liberal Party brought forward those motions, which clearly would have gutted the bill from having any strength at all?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666326">Mr. Speaker, I was there during the discussions that took place. We have to look at Bill <Document DbId="3822532" Type="3">C-27</Document> as a wide net that captures absolutely everything in its path. It is very important to look at Bill C-27 and ensure that it is functional. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666327">One of the concerns that we had with the bill was that it would be so broad that Internet use and all possibilities would come to a grinding halt. We had to explore all the possibilities so that business could continue to operate. We wanted to ensure that when we see a false statement being made that it actually is a false statement. What I believe the hon. member was referring to is materiality and that comes into play within the subject matter that he was talking about. If the subject matter says something and it is an omission or an error, then there should not be an automatic criminal charge put forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666328">We have seen that in other laws which I know the Conservatives are very concerned about, but it is important that we look at the bill and look at all possibilities, listen to all the people who have a vested interest in this, and look at what is best for all Canadians, so the Internet can continue to be a tool that we can use and grow with into the future and make it work to the full ability that it was intended to be.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666330">When I spoke during second reading of Bill <Document DbId="3822532" Type="3">C-27, Electronic Commerce Protection Act</Document>, I said that this legislation would address several issues facing many Quebeckers. The Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology heard a number of witnesses during its hearings on Bill <Document DbId="3822532" Type="3">C-27</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666331">Several groups raised more contentious issues relating to the bill, or asked for some justification. But all in all, witnesses told us that it was necessary to move forward with such legislation. I note in particular that when we compare our situation to that of other countries, we find that this bill is necessary. I would even say that Canada is a step behind some comparable countries. Therefore, the Bloc Québécois supports Bill <Document DbId="3822532" Type="3">C-27</Document>, as amended by the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666332">Incidentally, the clause by clause review of the bill did not really trigger a debate between the various parties, because all seemed to agree on its merits. However, I want to point out a contradiction by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice in the Conservative government. Last week, he said, in this House, that opposition parties had put up roadblocks to delay the passing of Bill <Document DbId="3822532" Type="3">C-27</Document>. That is absolutely false. That member surely did not ask for a report from his party colleagues on the committee, because he would have found out that the Bloc and the other opposition parties worked positively. I want to confirm that my party, the Bloc Québécois, and members representing the government and other opposition parties on the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, did work in a constructive fashion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666333">I sincerely believe that, during the hearings of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, all members worked hard to find a solution to the issue of spamming, while also meeting the needs of those businesses that voiced their concerns. Clearly, for some businesses, there is a natural fear about how legitimate businesses can continue to reach consumers and customers if the bill becomes law. I suspect that it will pass, because all the political parties at the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology unanimously supported it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666334">Bill <Document DbId="3822532" Type="3">C-27</Document> clearly spells out that organizations will not need the explicit consent of their own customers to communicate with them in the context of what can reasonably be called “existing business relationships”. However, if they want to reach potential customers to market a product or a service, or to expand their activities, businesses will not be allowed to communicate by email directly with these people without their prior consent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666335">Based on the testimonies of a number of groups, it became clear to the Bloc Québécois that an amendment was needed to extend from 18 to 24 months the period during which a business can communicate by email with a consumer without his prior consent. Members of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology agreed with the amendment proposed by the Bloc Québécois.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1666336">Even though the bill contains a number of legally complex clauses, its aim is to improve the efficiency and adaptability of the Canadian economy by regulating certain fraudulent commercial activities that use electronic mail. With all of the communications tools available today, we are constantly being solicited. We must have effective tools in place to protect the public. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666337"> In this regard, the Bloc Québécois expressed concern with regard to clauses 64 and 86 of Bill <Document DbId="3822532" Type="3">C-27, the electronic commerce protection act</Document>. It would amend the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission Act. In reality, these two clauses would give the government permission to eliminate the national do-not-call list. Implemented just over a year ago today, this legislation governing telemarketers has been a big success. Today, no fewer than 7,000 telephone numbers of Quebeckers and Canadians are on the list. This means it is working well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666338"> In the Bloc's opinion, the current list is doing its job and is used by millions. For a number of businesses, complying with the requirements of the national do-not-call list has meant reorganization of resources and considerable financial cost. In Quebec, for the Desjardins financial security group, which accounts for 10% of the business of the Desjardins movement, whose head office is in Lévis, a portion of the costs has been calculated at over $500,000. As this is 10% of the business of the Desjardins movement, it means that meeting the requirements of the national do-not-call list has cost the Desjardins group some $5 million. We can imagine that a new structure would mean additional costs for businesses that have had to comply with legislation that is one year old. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666339"> We understand that Industry Canada wants to keep the door open to replace the list with a new system. We have been given assurance by government officials that there will be no change to the do-not-call list without public hearings and consultation with those concerned to establish how it should proceed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666340"> The link I wanted to create with the national do-not-call list is simple. All email users know about spam. In recent months, the amount of spam appears to have increased significantly. We might ask ourselves whether businesses might have changed their means of contacting consumers before Bill <Document DbId="3822532" Type="3">C-27, the electronic commerce protection act</Document>, comes into force. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666341"> As an MP, I am concerned about the way businesses obtain consumers' consent to transfer or pass on their contact information or email addresses to other organizations. The new legislation will enable us to reduce spam and go after unsolicited commercial emails. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666342"> The Bloc has expressed support for another provision of the bill, which aims at prohibiting detrimental practices to electronic commerce, protecting the integrity of transmission data and prohibiting installation of computer programs without consent. It makes sense to avoid the use of consumers' personal information to send them spam. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666343"> Bill <Document DbId="3822532" Type="3">C-27</Document> thus prohibits the collection of personal information via access to computer systems without consent and the unauthorized compiling or supplying of lists of electronic addresses. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1666344"> We can hardly be against motherhood and apple pie. The Bloc Québécois feels that companies that want to send consumers information by email should get their consent first. Companies should get prior consent before communicating by the Internet or sending email.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666345"> This bill has a noble objective, but it will be a complex law to apply. According to the officials in Industry Canada, though, the CRTC, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner and the Office of the Information Commissioner are all going to work together in perfect harmony to figure out how to do it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666346"> The three agencies that will be affected by this change to the law will have to work closely together on the implementation of it. The CRTC will have to do what is necessary to stop unsolicited commercial electronic messages from being sent. The Competition Bureau, for its part, will have to deal with practices like misleading representations online, such as emails falsely claiming to be from financial institutions. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner will have to take measures to prevent the collection of personal information by means of unauthorized access to computer systems and the unauthorized compiling of lists of electronic addresses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666347"> I know the government wants to tackle spam as well. It accounts for 80% of all communications sent over the Internet. These are all the unwanted and unwelcome messages that consumers receive. I certainly agree with that. The committee has convinced me of the need to proceed with this kind of bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666348"> A number of countries have already passed measures similar to those in Bill <Document DbId="3822532" Type="3">C-27</Document> and seem to have had positive results. The various laws passed in Australia, the United States and Great Britain to combat spam have apparently been quite successful. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666349"> Bill <Document DbId="3822532" Type="3">C-27 </Document>will make it possible to develop measures to dissuade as many people as possible from sending spam involving false representation, unauthorized software and exchanges of email address information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666350"> The Bloc Québécois is in favour of Bill <Document DbId="3822532" Type="3">C-27</Document>. It should help solve a lot of problems that our constituents are encountering and help protect their privacy. Over the years, unsolicited commercial electronic messages have become a major social and economic problem that reduces the personal and business productivity of Quebeckers. As I said before, spam accounts for 80% of all the email that is sent to people. Thus, communications over the Internet are much less efficient than they could be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666351"> Spam is a real nuisance. It can damage computers and networks, contribute to fraudulent and misleading commercial practices, and infringe on our privacy. Spam poses a direct threat to the viability of the Internet as an effective means of communication. It undermines consumer confidence in legitimate electronic commerce and hampers electronic transactions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666352"> This is a constantly growing problem and, after years of study, it is time to pass a measure like this. In 2007, the Liberal government established a working group following the tabling of a report in 2005. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="20">(1620)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1666353">The two elections held between 2005 and 2009 have delayed the project. We are now at the important stage of discussing and adopting the electronic commerce protection act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666354"> Essentially, this electronic commerce protection act governs the sending of messages by email, text messaging or instant messaging without consent. Transmission of spam to an electronic mail account, telephone account or other similar accounts would be prohibited. The only time spam may be sent is when the person to whom the message is sent has consented to receiving it, whether the consent is express or implied. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666355"> There are other prohibitions as well. No person may alter the transmission data in an electronic message so that the message is delivered to another destination. Nor may they install a computer program on any other person's computer system or cause an electronic message to be sent from that computer system without the owner's consent. This bill clarifies consent before sending. Naturally there will be a timeline for implementation. It was 18 months at first, but it has been extended to 24 months following an amendment presented by the Bloc. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666356"> Bill <Document DbId="3822532" Type="3">C-27</Document> proposes a private right of action, modelled on U.S. legislation, which would allow businesses and individuals to take civil action against any wrongdoer. Any organization covered by Bill <Document DbId="3822532" Type="3">C-27 </Document> may, on its own initiative, transmit to the CRTC, the Privacy Commissioner, or the Commissioner of Competition any information in its possession if it deems that information to be related to a violation of the electronic commerce protection act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666357">These three bodies must also consult each other and may exchange any information in order to fulfill the responsibilities and activities they carry out under their respective statutes. Under certain conditions they may also provide such information to the government of a foreign state or to an international organization. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666358"> Canada is not the only country to legislate the protection of electronic commerce. Other countries have passed laws in this matter. France's legislation is known as the law to support confidence in the digital economy. It was adopted in June 2004 and was phased in over six months. Apart from specific rules set out in the postal, electronic communications and consumer legislation, France is required to ensure that solicitations by email, no matter what their nature—business, creative, political, religious or membership, for example—are subject to personal information protection legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666359">Therefore, Bill <Document DbId="3822532" Type="3">C-27</Document> is not unique when we look at what other countries are doing. However, having considered the evidence heard by the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology and having carefully read the bill, the Bloc Québécois is in favour of this bill. Therefore, at third reading, we will be voting in favour of this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666360">To conclude, I would like to summarize the main aspects of this bill: to prevent the receipt by consumers of unsolicited business e-mails; to prohibit certain practices in order to protect the integrity of transmission data and prevent the installation of unauthorized computer programs; to prohibit the collection of personal information by unauthorized access to computer systems and the unauthorized compiling or distribution of electronic address lists.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666368">One of the issues that has been of concern to us for some time is differentiating. We all know that spam is an irritant but the levels of spam are infecting computers to the levels of international fraud.

              <ParaText id="1666373">Mr. Speaker, as always, I am very honoured to rise in this place as a representative of the people from Timmins—James Bay, and I take that role very seriously. One of the roles that I am given as a member of Parliament is to review and speak on legislation. This legislation is something that we as members of Parliament need to see in terms of a larger vision. This is not just a one-off bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666374">In order for Canada to go where it needs to go in terms of a 21st century economy, we need to have a full vision in terms of the potential for digital innovation and also the pitfalls that are facing us. In terms of a large vision of where we need to be as a country holding its own and being a leader, we need to look at a number of initiatives. Earlier the issue of digital broadband access was brought up in the House. For a country that is as defined by geography as we are, to remain competitive, we need digital broadband. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666375">The FCC report last week, which would be one of the world leaders in terms of its credibility on this issue, it says how much Canada has fallen behind. We have gone from being a world leader in 2003 to a world laggard. Anyone watching this back home does not need the FCC to tell them that we are paying some of the highest fees for Internet access and we are getting some of the lousiest service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666376">The FCC talks about how it is that Canada went from being a world leader in terms of making sure broadband access was happening, where just in 2003 we were the country to watch, to now being in 20th, 25th, or 26th place on various parts, depending on what indicators we look at.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666377">The FCC points out the lack of competition in Canada. It is not pointing out the CRTC's dropping of the ball on this, but it speaks to something again that we are seeing, that when there is a very small cabal of companies that are basically now running the infrastructure of the Internet, unless there is innovation being pushed forward by small third-party ISPs, we will have a situation where development begins to ossify and that is what has happened. The FCC reports show how much we are falling behind because we are not getting that level of third-party competition from the smaller players. That is one of the elements we need to look at in terms of a larger vision. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666378">Second is the issue of net neutrality, which plays very much into the access of broadband. When there are a few giant players who are deciding the development of speed on the Internet, we cannot have them making the decision as to who is going to be in the fast lane and who is going to be in the slow lane. There needs to be a sense that, in order to have development on the Internet, net neutrality is a key cornerstone. This is not a principle of the so-called computer geeks. Talk to anybody in business and they will say that if they cannot get fast access, they are going somewhere else. They are very concerned about deep packet inspection, for example. They are very concerned that when they put information through VoIP, or through BitTorrent, it could be unfairly slowed down. So that is the second element of an innovation agenda that we need to look at.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666379">The third part of an innovation agenda is upgrading our copyright laws to the 21st century to ensure that we are moving forward and encouraging innovation and encouraging new ideas that may threaten some existing business models, but the only way we are going to have innovation is if we bring our copyright laws up to the 21st century agenda. I spend a great deal of time on the copyright file and I can say that we are finally at the point where we are agreeing that trying to implement laws that would work in 1996 is not going to get us anywhere. We need to be enacting laws that will bring us into the next 20 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666380">The other element in terms of a digital strategy is dealing with the irritant factor. That is how most people see spam. They see spam as an irritant. It affects all of us. Every time I go on my computer I have someone offering to sell me a product that is going to make certain parts of my body much larger than they otherwise would be. I think my ears are large enough as it is. I do not need any help, thanks very much. Nonetheless, they will not leave me alone. They are always offering to sell me real estate when I am still paying for the house I bought many years ago in northern Ontario. I could have used the help then, but I certainly did not need the help of spammers.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1666381">We laugh about the silly and stupid things we come across in spam day after day, but we need to see the effect that it is having in terms of not just our ability to do our work but the very nature of the threat it is posing to average citizens. Spammers are very tied into a growing level of Internet fraud. They undermine confidence. We do not want to go to a website and leave our email information, because we do not want it to be taken and misused.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666382">If we do not have confidence, it undermines our ability to move forward. Certainly the issue of spam is very serious. Canada has been singled out as the only G7 country without spam legislation. That puts us in a really bad light, because spammers will use our jurisdiction to push for spam. It is all well and good to say that we will get the emails of the spammers and hunt them down. If anybody has ever tried to track one of them down, they know that these emails do not go anywhere.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666383">What ends up happening is that there is a much more insidious move afoot. They move very quickly in terms of their technological innovation. They do not send the spam from a home computer, so they cannot be tracked. They use a number of techniques to basically act as a parasite on other messages going out, to the point where they can actually take over a person's computer without the person using it and download malicious software. They create these zombies or bots.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666384">The threat to privacy and innovation and the threat of fraud become compounded on a massive scale. This needs to be addressed and taken seriously. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666385">For example, just last year, the U.S. came down with some of the heaviest attacks on spammers. I was referring earlier to May 31, 2007, when they went after Robert Alan Soloway. They charged him with 35 criminal counts, including mail fraud, wire fraud, email fraud, aggravated identity theft and money laundering. Prosecutors were alleging that Soloway was using these zombie computers to distribute spam across wide networks. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666386">I will give an example of how this plays out. It is classic in terms of the development of the Internet. The greatest strength of the Internet is the ease with which one can get information out there. Of course, the greatest threat is the ease with which spammers can undermine it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666387">We can talk about the famous Nigerian 419 scam. Back in the day when the fax machine was the most exciting cutting-edge technology and I was working at a northern magazine, we used to get these emails from this guy. He was a former colonel in the Nigerian army. He was being held prisoner. If only I could send him $500, he would send me $100,000. It was very crude. It cost them money every time they sent that out. It went on a fax machine. It made tracking these guys a lot easier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666388">The 419 scam was a very marginal scam in the 1980s when it was first developed in Nigeria. It is interesting that Insa Nolte from the University of Birmingham said that the development of email turned the 419 scam from a local fraud to one of the largest export businesses in the country of Nigeria. That is how effective it has been.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666389">For every million people who click delete, one person in a million might respond. That is how the fraud happens. I am sure that my colleagues here can tell similar stories, but I am now starting to see email requests for help coming much closer to home, where similar last names of family members of constituents and local references are being used.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666390">This comes from the trolling of information that has been enabled under these massive networks of zombie computers. They can track and pick out names from the email traffic. They are picking out bits of stories and they are able to tailor the stories of personal need and personal threat. My daughter received one yesterday from someone who she thought might be a student who was lost in London. They had two or three key pieces of information about her and she could not figure out how they got that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666391">That is the kind of computer fraud that is now being perpetrated. Again, many of us will click through and delete. The problem is that there are enough people out there who will respond. So we are looking in terms of basic computer protection and basic civic protection. We need to do that.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1666392">However, we need to look at it in a larger area, in terms of what basic rules we are going to put down so that developers, innovators and citizens can use this wonderful new medium that we have, without fear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666393">I think some of the basic provisions in Bill <Document DbId="3822532" Type="3">C-27</Document> are fairly straightforward. We should be asked for consent before any computer program is downloaded on our computer. That should be basic. The idea that spyware could be put into our computer without us knowing should have criminal consequences. We know, for example, there are various forms, such as Trojan rootkits. Sometimes legitimate companies think that by being able to put this spyware into our computer it is going to protect them. But it does not. It undermines consumer confidence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666394">I just have to refer to the famous Sony rootkit disaster, where Sony decided that on its CDs it was going to put spyware and not tell the consumers. Consumers were buying these CDs, thinking they were buying a piece of music, putting them into their computers, and their computers were crashing and they could not figure out why. It turned out that Sony, one of the biggest entertainment companies in the world, had put in the spyware thinking it was going to go after copyright infringement and what it did was undermine its credibility in the marketplace to a great degree. Companies should never have been allowed to think that kind of move should have been able to take place. No citizen who buys a CD or any computer product to put into his or her system should have to worry that there is spyware in there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666395">So the issue of asking consent before any computer program or any spyware is put into our computer is a very reasonable provision and a necessary provision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666396">I think the other thing we need to speak to is that companies cannot take personal information without consent. That is another primary element of the Internet. When we go on the Internet and we go to a website or when we respond to email from someone we might not know, we want to know that our records on the computer, our data on the computer, is not being accessed, and that when we go to a website our information is not being passed on to someone who is then going to come and try to sell us some kind of scam product that we do not want.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666397">If we do not have that assurance, it starts to undermine the ability of consumers and companies to make the most of what they need to make the most of in terms of moving forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666398"> Earlier a Liberal colleague said he was worried that this was a big hammer that was going to shut down business, and we know there was certainly a big backlash against the Liberals when they seemed to be led around by the nose by some lobbyists on watering down provisions of this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666399"> I have looked at the provisions and I have looked at what the Liberals were trying to sneak through, and I do not think it is in line with the 21st century digital innovation agenda. Fortunately, the Liberals are not in the position to run a bill like this, where they would be able to undermine it and ensure that the corporate lobbyists got their way. There are citizen provisions that have to be addressed and this bill is looking at that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666400">It was the Liberals who wanting to limit the scope on spyware. I am astounded by that. I do not know if they think it is okay to spy on my computer, but I certainly do not think it is. And I, as an average citizen or a legislator, would not support that they wanted to exclude surreptitiously installed DRM from the gambit of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666401">Once again, when I go to a website or when I respond to an email, I do not want to have to worry that some company thinks it is okay to bury mechanical means for spying on what I am doing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666402">I was surprised by my Liberal colleagues on this bill, but I think there was certainly a large backlash, because the consumer public is very aware in terms of where we need to go with a digital agenda. So I am glad to see that we have moved forward with all parties on this bill.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1666403">The bill only addresses commercial electronic messages. This is not an attempt to shut down individuals who maybe want to do mass emails to their friends and to their friends' friends. There is no provision in the bill to go after people who send out those emails. Personally, I find those emails rather irritating. I do not think I have ever reached the bottom of one of the long lists of cc and cc and cc. I do think it is okay for individuals to do that. The question here is electronic messaging for commercial use. That is the main focus of this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666404">A personal relationship, a family relationship, a pre-existing business relationship would not be stopped. Companies would still be able to send information with respect to previous business dealings, such as someone buying software or something from a company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666405">I ask the simple question: What is the problem with asking the person for consent to continue? I do not see that impeding in any manner. If I purchase goods and I develop a relationship with a company, that is perfectly fine. But I want to know that my Parliament and legislation will back me up if I am not interested in receiving mass emails, that I can say I am not interested. That is not an unreasonable situation. Contrary to what the Liberals are saying, it is not going to grind business to a halt in Canada. It might if we were still back in the age of the fax machine, but this is certainly not going to grind innovation to a halt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666406">We worked at committee on this. This is a big bill. We had to look at many areas in terms of ensuring that spam legislation would actually address the problems. I am hopeful that this is the proper first step because we need to start addressing this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666407">We need to address this in terms of lost potential. We need to address this in terms of interference with competitiveness. We need to address this in terms of fraud. We need to address this in terms of the fundamental issue of consumer rights. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666408">Our computers should not be open to some third party that we do not know, a third party who could be dropping spyware into it, or using it to send out harassing emails, possibly fraudulent emails. When we are plugged into the web, we should not have to worry about what is going to come back down the pipe that we do not want.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666409">Bill <Document DbId="3822532" Type="3">C-27</Document> takes some steps toward addressing that. Does it do everything that is necessary? I do not think that is possible at this point. We are going to have to amend and change it as we go because the Internet changes quickly, fraudsters change quickly. We have to run just to keep up as legislators, but this is a good first step.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1666415">Mr. Speaker, the issue is of how phishing is used to send out a simple email. Someone responds and then basically they have got that person. They have information. They can use that information against that person. That is a huge concern.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666416">I would like to put it in a broader context. Where it is being used now in a very dangerous way is on Facebook. The Privacy Commissioner has certainly come out, as a result of the excellent work of the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic at the University of Ottawa, and raised the issue of privacy concerns on Facebook. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666417">Every one of us is on Facebook, I am sure. Our kids are on Facebook. They do not see that posting their names, their cellphone numbers, all kinds of personal information about themselves, can hurt them down the road, because there are scammers out there. What is our solution? Is our solution as legislators to say, “Bad, bad, bad. We have to shut this down”, or is it to say that, no, we need to have the laws in place to protect people and to go after the people who misuse it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666418">Second, I think it is as important, not within the confines of the bill and it would not fit within the bill but I think it is something we need to look at, is the need to educate young people. Until people have been scammed, they will never get scammed so they do not have to worry about it. But as I said earlier, I used the example of a young student who received a scam yesterday and it had three pertinent pieces about her and her personal identity that she figured it had to be someone she knew.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666419"> All we have to do is go on Facebook. I could tell a people what high school they went to. I could tell them who their first girlfriend was. I could tell them their date of birth and their star sign. If I am looking to scam a person, going on Facebook is the first place I would go. It is the ultimate phishing expedition and people will see some long-term implications from that kind of free flow of personal, private information that people think is protected because it has just been seen by their friends, but third party applications are using it, and all kinds of corporate entities are getting in and getting access to this information.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666423">Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's example is very pertinent because it actually speaks to another level. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666424">I spoke of Facebook and young people getting scammed. The banking information tends to affect older people because they are very concerned about their bank credit. They receive an email, and I have received a similar email which looks just like it comes from my bank, and the email says it needs my banking information because there has been a fraud committed. That is how it happens. A person believes they have had a relationship with their bank, but if they look at those emails closely, they will suddenly realize there is something not quite correct. The hon. member raises an excellent point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666425">Within the confines of the bill, it will be able to go after the scammers who are sending these kinds of messages out. It will allow for people to sue, which is an important provision. The bigger issue, though, goes back to the issue we face with Facebook. We really need a larger information campaign about the rights of the digital citizen and what people need to do to protect themselves. It is not about locking the Internet down. That will not happen. It is about giving people a level of assurance, whether they are senior citizens who are getting on the Internet for the first time or whether they are young people or whether they are people like us who press, press, press, click, click, click all day long. We never know when we will make that mistake. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666426">We do need to have this discussion. It is not a partisan discussion. This is a discussion we need to have as a Canadian legislature in terms of looking at some of the problems out there that are not being addressed.

              <ParaText id="1666429">Mr. Speaker, Clay Shirky has just written a book entitled <I>Here Comes Everybody</I> and what he says in it is that we are on the verge of an absolute transformation in industrial design in terms of economic ordering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666430">Clay says that when new technology comes in is not when the revolution happens. The revolution happens when the technology becomes boring and every day. When everybody is posting pictures of their babies online and emailing back and forth is when the real, new transformative powers begin to happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666431">What Clay talks about is cognitive surplus. For example, if most of us go online and basically treat it like TV, there is no difference. However, if 5% of us are on maybe a genealogical site putting information online or doing something like Flickr where there are millions and millions of photos being built up, there is power in so many people putting just 1% or 2% of their time into building something bigger, like Wikipedia, which has enormous transformative power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666432">If we look at the success of Wikipedia, Clay is positing that this is the beginning of this sort of wiki building of all kinds of people coming together. That is the new model for design innovation. That is where we are going to begin to see the whole transformation of the industrial complex. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666433">Whereas before, it was hierarchical, top down; now, there is going to be a whole movement. However, in order to make that happen, there has to be confidence and people have to know that as they are sharing information, they are not being ripped off, that they are not going to be getting hit with tons of emails and subjected to fraud. There has to be a sense that they can go online to transform and build new economies, new ideas, and new systems of working together. There has to be confidence and one way to get that confidence is to get the scammers, the spammers and the fraudsters off the Internet.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666435">As chair of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, I want to recognize the constructive work of all the members of the committee from all parties in improving the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666436">The bill, as amended, from committee has benefited from the work over the past months of the members of the committee. As a result, a number of key elements in the bill have been strengthened, clarified and have been done in a way without diminishing the core principles of what the government has been trying to achieve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666437">Email is a wonderful technology, and it has only been just over 10 years that we have all been using email broadly. In just over 10 years, it has completely changed our lives. However, many of the benefits of email have been offset by the problem of spam, which is unwanted and unsolicited commercial emails.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666438">According to a MessageLabs report of September 2009, which is a division of Symantec Corporation, spam accounted for as much as 86% of all global email traffic. Unfortunately, Canada is in part responsible for this problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666439">Canada ranks as one of the top originating states for spam. In Cisco 2008 Annual Security Report Canada ranked fourth on the list of spam by originating country list.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666440">Late last year in the United States, Facebook won $873 million U.S. in damages from an American court arising from the activities of a spammer based in Canada. That case was prosecuted in the United States and not in Canada. That speaks to the lack of Canadian legislation in place to prevent this kind of activity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666441">The high volume of spam in recent years has negatively affected the productivity of the Internet and all the technologies associated with the Internet. When a high volume of email is spammed, many people spend hours deleting unwanted messages, networks slow down and companies are forced to spend millions, if not billions of dollars, upgrading their systems, their networks, their backbones, their routers, their pipes to the Internet in order to accommodate the additional bandwidth and network capacity needed to handle this volume of email traffic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666442">The high volume of spam has impeded the full potential of the Internet as a platform for both personal and commercial use. Spam is more than just unwanted email. It is often used as a vehicle to perpetrate fraud on Canadians. It can lead to online fraud by luring individuals to counterfeit websites, also known as phishing. It can lead to the theft of personal data to rob bank accounts and credit card accounts, called identity theft. It can lead to the collection of personal information through elicit access on one's laptop or on one's computer, known as spyware. It often is used as a vehicle to perpetrate fraud on Canadians</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666443">Not just Canadians suffer but Canadian businesses suffer and often this is an overlooked fact of spam. Canadian businesses suffer because they are the victims of the counterfeiting of their corporate website to defraud individuals. We all know of examples of getting emails from spammers or from other people who wish to perpetrate fraud. They ask for people's banking information. They send an email that contains a page that looks like a Royal Bank website or a TD Bank website and often many unsuspecting individuals give their information to these spammers, the people trying to perpetrate this fraud.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666444">It also leads to spam borne viruses and other malicious software called malware, which are used to create networks of zombie computers known botnets without the knowledge of their owners. This undermines confidence not just that Canadians have in the Internet but that Canadian businesses have in the Internet as a platform for commerce, as a platform for doing business in the 21st century.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666445">I do not think it is hyperbole to say that spam is costing Canadians and Canadian businesses billions of dollars a year in fraud, in network capacity and in the need to upgrade systems to handle the volumes of email which we are seeing. It costs the economy through malicious programs such as malware, spyware, phishing, viruses, worms and Trojans that enter computers. It costs the economy in terms of undermining Canadians and Canadian businesses in their confidence of the Internet, often having to rely on old-fashioned ways of doing business because the Internet is not seen as trustworthy enough to conduct certain types of business transactions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666446">In response to this problem, the Government of Canada launched a task force on spam to consult Canadians and their businesses. The task force was given one year to consult and report. In May 2005 the task force reported its findings and recommendations in a report to the <Affiliation DbId="128698" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation>. I want to thank the members of the task force for their valuable work in this regard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666447">Our government has acted on the recommendations and findings of the task force by introducing Bill <Document DbId="3822532" Type="3">C-27</Document>, anti-spam legislation entitled “The Electronic Commerce Protection Act”, or the ECPA. This legislation will deter the most damaging form of spam from happening in Canada and will help drive spammers and their associated activity out of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666448">The legislation addresses the recommendations of the task force on spam, which brought together experts from industry, academia, consumers and other business experts to come together to craft a comprehensive set of measures to combat threats to the online economy. Successful legislative models in other states were also examined and taken into account when drafting the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666449"> The legislation will allow Industry Canada to act as a national coordinating body to educate consumers, track and analyze statistics and trends and lead policy oversight and coordination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666450"> The legislation will also facilitate the establishment of a non-governmental agency, the spam reporting centre, which will receive reports of spam and related online threats, allowing it to collect evidence and gather intelligence to assist the three reporting agencies, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, the Competition Bureau and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, with the investigation and prosecution of offences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666451">It is important to note that the ECPA does not apply to non-commercial activity. Political parties and charities, other organizations that contact Canadians through email will not be subject to the ECPA, provided these emails do not involve selling or promoting a product.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666452">Bill <Document DbId="3822532" Type="3">C-27</Document> will protect Canadians and their businesses from the most damaging and deceptive forms of electronic harms and provide a regulatory regime to protect the privacy and personal security of Canadians. The rules will encourage confidence in online communications and e-commerce on the Internet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666453">The bill before us provides the CRTC, the Competition Bureau and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner with the tools they need to pursue those who undermine our online economy and to work with one another and their international counterparts. The bill has sharp teeth, administrative monetary penalties of up to $1 million for individuals and up to $10 million for businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666454">The bill in front of us today resulted from a great deal of work from several different sources. On the one hand, we had the recommendations and findings of the 2005 Task Force on Spam. On the other hand, we have also benefited from some of the work that former Senator Goldstein did in Bill S-220 in this regard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666455">Some of the features in this bill differ from what Mr. Goldstein had previously proposed. One of the most important is the use of the CRTC, the Competition Bureau and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner to enforce the provisions, in other words, using regulatory agencies to enforce the provisions of the spam bill rather than using police enforcement agencies as Bill S-220 had proposed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666456">The RCMP has other urgent law enforcement responsibilities, and I believe we should not redirect those precious resources to the monitoring of unsolicited commercial email. I believe that regulatory authorities are better positioned than law enforcement authorities for this kind of white collar problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666457">In drafting Bill <Document DbId="3822532" Type="3">C-27</Document>, the government also drew on a wealth of experience in other states in combating spam. The bill drew on work that had been done in New Zealand, Australia and in the United States. The bill also benefited from the approach taken by other states as well. The bill before us is based on the best and most effective aspects of those legislative regimes in those states.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1666458">By being consistent with the approaches of other states, by using regulatory approaches and regulatory agencies in effecting this anti-spam bill rather than law enforcement agencies, we will help promote greater international co-operation to combat spam and other online fraud.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666459">As members of the House know, Bill <Document DbId="3822532" Type="3">C-27</Document> adopts an express consent regime designed to give businesses and consumers control over their inboxes and their computers. It requires that the individual's consent be sought and obtained in order to permit an ongoing commercial transaction. Once consent has been expressed by an individual, it remains until the individual opts out or revokes that consent. The industry committee took a careful look at how to ensure that the companies that used email could keep in touch with consumers so they did not inadvertently find themselves in violation of the law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666460">Members of the House will also know that the bill contains implied consent provisions that have been expanded to include suspicious publication of an electronic address. If someone publishes his or her email address on a website or in a print advertisement, he or she is considered to have consented to receive unsolicited commercial messages, provided the sender's message relates to the business or office held by the person.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666461">Consent is also implied when a person gives out a business card or provides an email address in a letter. Similarly, the amended bill clarifies that when a business is sold, the purchaser has an implied consent to contact the customers of that business. Following the initial transaction between a business and a consumer, the period of implied consent has been expanded to 24 months from the original 18, as first contained in the original bill. This gives businesses even more time in which to obtain the express consent to further commercial transactions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666462">Another area in which the bill has been amended is in ensuring that updates to computer programs are not adversely affected by the protections we have put in place against malware and spyware. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666463">The committee looked at the impact the bill would have on the installation of computer programs. It has been amended in the situation where the installation of updates, as it is understood as part of an original contract under which the software is installed, is not prohibited by the bill. Most of these programs call for automatic updates, such as daily or weekly updates, to anti-virus software. These updates will not require fresh consent for each instance. Running programs such as JavaScript or Flash programs will also not require express consent each time they are run.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666464">Let me say a few words about the private right of action before I conclude. Some hon. members have questioned whether a private right of action is necessary. I believe it is. The private right of action enforces and complements the enforcement efforts of the CRTC, the Competition Bureau and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. I would remind the House that this feature has been very effective in other jurisdictions in shutting down those such as spammers who have caused to the electronic economy. I believe it will be equally effective here in allowing groups or individuals to pursue violators. The private right of action will allow individuals and businesses suffering financial harm an avenue of recourse to be compensated and awarded damages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666465">Finally, the bill is technology-neutral. Bill <Document DbId="3822532" Type="3">C-27</Document> recognizes that the convergence of voice and data is happening and will eventually be complete. It will allow the Government of Canada to prevent spam and associated threats regardless of how the technology evolves. Therefore, the bill will remain current in the future as technology evolves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666466">If Bill <Document DbId="3822532" Type="3">C-27</Document> is passed by the House at third reading, Canada will go a long way to combatting spam and spam-related threats. Based on the experience of other states with similar legislation, a reduction in spam is quickly expected. When Australia adopted similar legislation in 2004, it dropped out of the world's top 10 spam-originating states and major spammers in Australia closed their operations altogether.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666467">While the legislation will not eliminate spam entirely, Canadians will see a reduction in the amount of spam in their inboxes. Equally important, the legislation will decrease the most damaging forms of spam from originating in Canada and will help drive spammers and their associated illegal activities out of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666468">The Internet has become the primary platform for online commerce and general communications. Canada has had a long history of global leadership in the telecommunications sector. E-commerce is now a part of the Canadian economy, with billions of dollars of goods and services being sold over the Internet each year in Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1666469">If adopted by Parliament, this legislation would allow Canada to continue in that leadership, ensuring that we remain a secure locale for e-commerce and for Canadians. It is time for Canadian law to catch up with the Internet age. All parties in the House have expressed their desire to strengthen confidence in online commerce. All parties are opposed to spam and see the danger of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666470">We have studied this bill at great length in committee and have emerged with important amendments that clarify it. The time has come to pass it at third reading.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1666473">Mr. Speaker, part of this debate that is often overlooked is the cost to Canadian businesses and the problems that Canadian corporations have in managing their email networks. From personal experience, I can say that it costs billions of dollars for Canadian corporations to handle the volumes of spam that we are now seeing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666474">As the House knows, we in Parliament have size limits on our inboxes. The simple reality is that the volume of email coming into the House of Commons and Senate computer systems is such that a great volume of these emails are spam. While companies can put in place firewalls, routers and other forms of software on their servers to redirect or block spam, at the end of the day, a lot of this spam still makes its way through those firewalls and routers and into the email servers, which then become completely clogged and saturated with this spam. As a result, legitimate transactions and emails are often slowed down or mailboxes are restricted in terms of the amount of email they can handle in order to deal with all of the spam that is being received.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666475">Backup systems have to be enlarged. Bandwidth has to be enlarged. Email systems have to be expanded. All of these represent hidden costs to Canadian businesses. Many times, the senior management of these businesses does not realize the number of dollars that are being wasted on IT departments and chief information officers to handle the volumes of spam that we are seeing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666476">I think this bill is a move in the right direction because it is going to help Canadian businesses combat the time wasting and resource wasting that this problem creates, despite the efforts taken to put network security in place and expand data storage systems.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1666477">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate on Bill <Document DbId="3822532" Type="3">C-27</Document>. PIPEDA falls under the jurisdiction of the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics with regard to personal information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666478">A number of members have been involved in one aspect of this and that is identity theft. It is a very serious problem in our society and the stories are horrific. The impacts it can have on people are very tragic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666479">I certainly want to speak in support of the bill, basically to start the process of educating legislators, because this is a starting point from which we need to continue to grow due to the velocity with which the information and technology are growing, as well as some of the tricks and things that we have seen and the way the envelope is being pushed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666480">Most members will have seen things in their inboxes from people identifying themselves as representatives of their bank. The emails say that the bank is doing a security check and requires members to provide their account numbers or something like that. They look very official. As a matter of fact, often the logos of a bank or the proper or stylized name of the bank will appear. Yet Canadians should understand that banks do not do business related to security and privacy over the Internet. It is just not a secure environment in which to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666481">This bill would establish a regulatory framework, which I think is a very good start. Our economy is changing. Our kids grew up with computers. Their ability to move very quickly through the electronic world is absolutely fascinating.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666482">I actually have a degree in computer science from the University of Western Ontario and at the time I took that degree, we were using punch cards, which will give everyone an idea of where I came from. This is a very serious issue, and I am glad that we are at least at the point that this bill is at third reading and this electronic commerce protection act would prohibit the sending of commercial electronic messages without prior consent of the recipient.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666483">It brings to mind the do not call list system that was established, which Canadians will say does not work very well. It is problematic and we should probably learn from the experience of the do not call list that notwithstanding the mechanisms that have been put in place, somehow things slip through. There is a caution that as much as we legislate, we are not going to be able to anticipate all the pitfalls that may transpire.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666484">This act would also amend the Competition Act to prohibit false and misleading commercial representations made electronically. As I have indicated, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, referred to as PIPEDA, prohibits the collection of personal information by means of unauthorized access to computer systems and the unauthorized compiling of lists of electronic addresses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666485">That is a reasonable indication that the bill addresses this from sufficient directions. However, I asked a question earlier of the previous speaker. The role of business in this also comes into play. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666486">Last week I just happened to receive a document called “The Canadian Privacy and Data Security Toolkit”. This is for small and medium size enterprises, many of which are active. These are the ones that are extremely active, scouring the bushes, looking for that bit of business, that niche for their businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666487">The foreword is by our Privacy Commissioner, Jennifer Stoddart, and the introduction is by Ann Cavoukian, Ph.D., Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario.

              <ParaText id="1666498">We can see that this is not an inconsequential item we are dealing with for either side. The individual's private information needs to be protected, and a business whether small, medium or large has a role to play in protecting that information which they legitimately acquire through business transactions. There is often the temptation to utilize that information for unauthorized uses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666499">There was a case recently within the Government of Canada involving, and I will try not to be too specific, a program to do with a grant for doing something energy related. People who applied for that grant started to receive information on other areas of the government. When someone applies to the Government of Canada for a grant, I would suggest that they do not expect to find themselves on a mailing list and getting information to do with other matters related to the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666500">The government itself is also strongly targeted here with regard to its practices. We have to be vigilant to ensure that none of the information the government collects, regardless of the department, is inadvertently or advertently used for a purpose which was unauthorized by the person who made contact with the government in the first place.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1666501">There is one other thing that I thought was kind of interesting. Under privacy impact assessment, there is a quick privacy self-assessment. I thought it would be interesting to let members know what small and medium-sized businesses might do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666502">The first item is, do we know our privacy obligations? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666503">Some businesses are busy. I must admit, from an accountant's perspective, most people who run small and medium-sized businesses are more interested in doing business than they are in keeping the books and dealing with the myriad of paperwork and legislative reporting, but this is about knowing the privacy obligations, both federal and provincial, because there are some differences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666504">The second item is, has the organization assigned responsibility for compliance with privacy legislation and policy?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666505"> This is an important aspect, because it is an indication of whether the company is taking it seriously, that it has a serious responsibility to comply with provincial and federal legislation and to be proactive in terms of protecting the information of individuals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666506">The third accountability and management assessment question is, has the organization conducted an inventory of personal information to identify what information has been collected, where the information is collected from, who has access to that information and to whom may be the information be disclosed externally?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666507">That is extremely important, because as we well know, one of the ways that people get on mailing lists is that people who accumulate personal information tend to share it or sell it to others. All of a sudden, like a pyramid scheme, it just continues to expand to where all information seems to be in the hands of all people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666508">The fourth assessment point is, does the organization make use of online privacy resources, for example, websites of the privacy commissioners or the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants, to assist with privacy compliance and awareness of privacy developments?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666509">Keeping on top of it is clearly very important, and it will be important for us also to readily assess the evolution of this electronic vehicle that is being used and has caused a great deal of difficulty and problems for individuals and for businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666510">The next point asks, has the organization adopted a privacy policy that addresses collection, use, disclosure to third parties, secure disposal of personal information and retention of personal information as it applies to particular operations?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666511">With regard to that last point about the retention, there is a shelf life for information. For instance, if we have information about someone who is deceased, all of a sudden, if it is made known, that information has to be destroyed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666512">Our committee has dealt with even something like Google Street View. There are some privacy implications there. There are a couple of others where we have provided information to offshore parties as well, being able to control that or make sure of that when we are complying under obligations we have, for instance, with the United States, which requires that for any aircraft that even just flies over any its air space, documents have to be provided as to who the passengers are and where they came from, et cetera.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666513">Those are extremely important because our private information, our personal information, is everywhere. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666514">I must admit that I tend to keep thinking about whether I should just report as lost and not recoverable all my cards and the other things that have my personal information on them and get new numbers, simply as almost a reaction to what can happen. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666515">Just last week I got a phone call from my bank. I have a U.S. credit card because I have family in the United States, and we travel sometimes to visit them and I use that card. I have not been to California in about 10 years because that is not where my family is, but I was advised that there were two $1,000 charges to my U.S. credit card. The bank took all the information and advised me that those charges would not be left on my account, and I have a new card today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666516">Some cards do protect us, but not all of them. It is incumbent on people to understand what can happen when their personal information is used or stolen. Do they have coverage in some fashion? Some of the instruments we use do provide protection.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666517">There are two more questions on the privacy policy side. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666518">The sixth question asks, is the privacy policy made available to individuals prior to or at the time that the personal information is collected? Basically, do employees know what is going on and are they aware of all of the policy related to the activity they are undertaking? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666519">Finally, the self-assessment asks, are your employees aware of the privacy policy and able to direct individuals to it?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666520">I found this to be an excellent document. It also has a checklist on privacy procedures, training and disclosure to third parties. One could even score oneself on this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666521">I would certainly recommend this document to hon. members or others who might want to know a bit more from the perspective of business and how it would be able to interact with this legislation. This legislation would help businesses understand the kinds of things they must be aware of and cautioned not to do. It would also make businesses aware of the kinds of things they could do proactively, and that is a complement to the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666522">Again, this document is called “The Canadian Privacy and Data Security Toolkit for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises”, and it is published by the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants. I am sure that hon. members would be able to get it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666523">I appreciate the fact that this legislation has come forward. I think there will be good support from all hon. members. We need this bill to give us the foundation or the basis on which to be able to assure Canadians that we are taking all reasonable steps to provide an environment in which personal information is protected from those who would misuse it or use it for other wrongful purposes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666524">The bill itself is fairly straightforward. I appreciate that this was a lot of work for committee. I commend committee for going through it. I did notice the breadth of the work that has been done not only at committee, but by others prior to committee work. A long evolutionary process has brought us to this point. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666525">It is extremely important that members also familiarize themselves with this. I hope members take an opportunity in their householders to advise their constituents about important legislation such as this, as well as some tips for Canadians at large to help them safeguard their personal information.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666528">The other part of the problem that this bill is attempting to address is the fact that even if spam were not a vehicle for online fraud, even if spam were not a delivery mechanism for all these malicious types of computer programs, even if spam were not doing anything malicious in terms of what it is delivering to people's computer inboxes, it has a second major problem that is often overlooked, which is that it chews up a huge amount of bandwidth, of storage space on corporate and other computer systems. It is reported that up to 85% of all email traffic in the world is spam, and that costs a huge amount to Canadian businesses in terms of bandwidth usage, in terms of storage space, and that is often overlooked.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666529"> Much of the spam cannot be blocked by firewalls or routers or other forms of technology. The proof is that when we go into our Hotmail account or Yahoo! Mail account or Gmail account, there will be a folder for spam, because spam cannot even be blocked from entering into their systems and their networks. This has a huge hidden cost for the Internet, both for consumers and for Canadian businesses. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666533">On the commercial side, the member is absolutely right. This is a tremendous amount of information. On a personal level, our computers get filled up pretty quickly. I think members of Parliament have all experienced the same thing, where they can go into their office after having left late at night and find somewhere between 100 and 200 emails in their computer. This is such an easy facility to use, so we can understand that so many of these are people from around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666534"> The member is quite right that the risk to us is that we have the intelligence or maybe the misapplication of intelligence of virtually the entire world looking at ways in which it can intrude, looking at ways in which it can take advantage of our information, destroy our information, share it with others, or park itself for activation later on.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="128305" Type="2">Mr. Robert Vincent (Shefford, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1666539">Mr. Speaker, I would first like to say that we support this bill. I see the committee chair nodding his head that, yes, it is an excellent bill. I must say, this bill is a good start. This new legislation specifically targets unsolicited commercial electronic messages. Citizens have been demanding such a bill for some time, and it is sorely needed. Not only are commercial emails sent with the prior consent of the recipient important to electronic commerce, but they are also essential to the development of the online economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666540">By drafting legislation prohibiting spam and protecting personal information and privacy, as well as computers, emails and our networks, the proposed legislation is designed to allow individuals and companies to sue spammers and hold any businesses whose products and services are promoted using these means partially responsible for spamming activity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666541">As well, email marketers would be required to obtain informed consent from recipients to receive emails; provide an opting-out mechanism for further emails; and create a complaints system. That is the main purpose of the bill. Since most spam Canadians receive comes from other countries, international anti-spam measures are needed. The government should continue its efforts to harmonize anti-spam policies and encourage countries to work together on enforcing anti-spam legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666542">I would like to talk about this a bit longer. We know that spam comes from all over the world. That is one thing. But Canadian law applies only to Canada and Canadians, not to other countries. How might this affect us as consumers? What sort of commercial impact might it have? Businesses here in Canada will not be able to distribute advertising on the Internet using software or other ways of communicating with a computer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666543">The biggest problem is that because other countries are not subject to this law and their legislation is not harmonized with Canada's, they can keep on sending messages. If I have a business and I decide to send advertising over the Internet for doors, windows and other things, I cannot send a mass mailing. But a business in another country can.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666544">We have to be competitive with industries around the world, because we are part of a global economy now. So what reason do we have to protect consumers? Protecting them against phishing or hacking is one thing, but we must not forget business. That was the committee's main concern. We must not prevent businesses here from continuing to make a profit. Eight billion transactions are carried out on the Internet. I believe that Canadian businesses should enjoy a share of this growth with all the people here in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666545">It is vital that we ask ourselves whether we want to protect our industries or consumers. Should we let others continue to do business without our being able to participate? These are the questions that should be raised, and they have been raised. They have not received a full answer, but this bill is a major step, because it proposes a concrete measure within a timeframe. It took four years to come up with this legislation, because we wanted something better. As we know, things change much more rapidly with the Internet, where six months is an eternity.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1666546">So, fairly soon after this bill is passed, we will have to take time to see how things are unfolding and to make adjustments, as cyberpirates target us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666547"> By the way, how do we define spam? Spam is any electronic commercial message, any text, audio, voice or visual message sent by any means of telecommunication—whether by email, cellular phone text messaging or instant messaging—without the consent of recipients. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that its purpose is to encourage participation in a new commercial activity, and that it includes electronic messages that offer to purchase, sell, barter or lease a product, good, service, land or an interest or right in land, or offer a business, investment or gaming opportunity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666548">I mentioned what spam is. It has to do with commercial activities, including offers to purchase, sell, barter or lease a product, good, service, land or an interest or right in land. All these are commercial activities that exist here. With this legislation, these people will no longer be able to use the Internet to send their messages. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666549">What is left for these people to be competitive? Not much. They could use mail services. However, this can be costly, considering that, as I mentioned, such costs will not be incurred in other countries. We always hear—as one member said—that spam requires a lot of work. It takes someone to prepare these emails. If, all of a sudden, we prevent our industries from using the Internet to sell or rent all the products that I listed earlier, what are they going to do? As I just said, they will have to rely on mail services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666550">Just think how clogged up the system could get if every industry decided to send a mass mailing to all the other businesses, or to households. How much time would businesses spend opening mail, instead of emails? Of course, Canada Post would be pleased, since postal rates are exorbitant, but businesses would no longer be competitive, because of these costs. We should not forget that, because this is a significant economic consideration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666551">Having said what is considered spam, it is also important to point out what is not. What is not spam are messages sent by an individual to another individual with whom they have a personal or family relationship. For instance, I have no personal ties to you, Mr. Speaker. Imagine I send you a message, not as a member, since that is not allowed. So imagine that someone from outside the House sends you an email, he or she could be subject to fines, since this legislation no longer allows emails from one person to another. The bill reads:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">—a message that is sent to a person who is engaged in a commercial activity and consists solely of an inquiry or application related to that activity. </QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666553">Regarding commercial activities, witnesses came to testify that, initially, the bill required 18 months of contact with the other person. Let me give an example. I know that about every four or five years, family situations and incomes change, so people could be selling their house and buying a new one. With this new law, the real estate agent who sold me my house can no longer contact me after 18 months. In fact, he would be subject to a fine, if the 18-month time limit has passed. In committee, we were able to change that timeframe to 24 months. We would have preferred it to be even longer, to allow businesses and individuals to continue communicating with their existing clients.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666560">This bill will completely define the issue. There will surely be some flaws, as with any bill, whether it is good or bad. Since this is a new bill, there are always flaws because we forgot something or did not think to regulate something. Over time, we will have to re-examine the bill, more quickly than any other bill, to ensure that we have not left anything out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666561">The only circumstances under which spam could be sent would be if the person to whom the message is sent has consented to receiving it, whether the consent is express or implied. So, if I send a message and the individual agrees to receive it, a relationship has been established. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666562">Let us take that same real estate agent, and let us assume that I heard from one of my colleagues that his brother-in-law has a house to sell. I would not be able to send that brother-in-law an email to let him know that his brother-in-law had informed me about the house for sale, or to tell him that I know someone who would be interested in buying the house. I could not do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666563">I could only do it over the telephone. I could directly contact the individual via telephone or meet them in person. I would have to establish contact before doing business with this person.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666564">So therein lies the problem. Anyone who wishes to establish a business relationship with another person must now do so via the telephone or mail, or meet the individual in person. They could not send a simple email. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666565">We are setting limits. That is the message I want to get across. We are setting limits, but we cannot limit other countries in sending us these messages. We have to consider doing that and count on the goodwill of other countries such as the United States, Australia, France or other European countries. This type of legislation needs to be harmonized. Many countries do not have such regulations or laws. They can therefore do what they want because they are not subject to such legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666566">In addition to being in a form that conforms to the prescribed requirements, the message will have to make it possible to identify and contact the sender. The message must include an unsubscribe mechanism, with an email address or hyperlink, so that the recipient can indicate that he or she does not want to receive any further commercial electronic messages from the sender. If I send a message or an email, at the end of that message there specifically needs to be a box to check or a note explaining to the person how to stop receiving further messages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666567">I think this is the right approach, but in order for it to be successful inquiries would be necessary. The CRTC would have interesting powers. It could require a person to preserve transmission data, produce a copy of a document that is in their possession and prepare a document based on data, information or documents that are in their possession. It could also conduct a site visit in order to gather such information or, if necessary, to establish whether there was a violation. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="50">(1750)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1666568"> Because it cannot do that itself, note that it will have to get a warrant from a justice of the peace prior to entering premises. It cannot do that by itself; the CRTC cannot do it by itself; the Competition Bureau has certain powers, but there again its powers are limited. Today, the Competition Bureau has no powers of inquiry. That is why there is Bill <Document DbId="4109272" Type="4">C-452</Document>, which will give the Competition Bureau three types of powers of inquiry: an exclusive power of inquiry, a power of inquiry to summon and protect witnesses, and a power to search. That is what is important. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666569"> How can agencies conduct inquiries and do the work for which they have been created if they have no power? I have introduced Bill <Document DbId="4109272" Type="4">C-452</Document> to give the Competition Bureau this power so it can conduct inquiries and do the work we expect of it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666570"> If the court believes that a person has violated any of those provisions, it may, which is not to say that it will have to, order that the applicant be paid an amount representing the loss or damages suffered, or any expenses incurred. If it is impossible for the applicant to establish those amounts, the court may order that the applicant be paid a maximum of $200 per contravention, up to a maximum of $1 million. I am choosing my words carefully: not “shall order”, but “may order”. That is very different. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666571"> As I said earlier, the CRTC, the Competition Bureau and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner must also consult one another, and they may share any information with one another in order to carry out their activities and responsibilities pursuant to their respective powers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666572"> So there are three agencies: the CRTC, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner and the Competition Bureau. Together, they have certain powers under the bill. However, they must be capable of communicating with one another. We know that these agencies have their private preserves and they are not prone to disclosing information. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666573"> The Office of the Privacy Commissioner is another thing again. The Liberal member referred to this earlier. That Office is an important player in this regard. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666574">Unsolicited commercial electronic messages are becoming a serious social and economic problem that undermines the personal and commercial productivity of Quebeckers. Not only do they hinder email use for personal communications but they also threaten the growth of legitimate e-commerce. As I mentioned earlier, when people are assigned to open these emails, time is lost and businesses become less competitive. That causes a problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666575">I would like to point out something else. The minister, or another organization somehow involved in Bill <Document DbId="3822532" Type="3">C-27</Document>, has managed to ensure that a clause in this bill could jeopardize the National Do-Not-Call List (DNCL). A door has been opened because one of the clauses states that the DNCL—set up by this government and containing the telephone numbers of seven million people who do not wish to be unnecessarily pestered by telemarketers—could be deactivated. They have now made it possible, within one year, to eliminate a list that cost millions to set up.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666603">I think that the last interchange is an indication that the legislation before us may have its shortcomings but the urgency with respect to bringing the legislation forward is undeniable. It is undeniable because of the invasiveness of spam and that people's lives can be turned absolutely upside down by those who use spam with the intent to defraud and to use information that is available through access to information. It has been pointed out that no technological firewall or router can act as a barrier and people are absolutely susceptible to those who have spent a huge amount of time thinking of how they can, through an email invasion, access information that will be used fraudulently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666604">This is not an issue over which the government or any particular party has proprietary rights. In this House we all share the responsibility to have in place a legislative regime that anticipates the nature of this invasion through electronic commerce with the intent to defraud or to put forward false information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666605">We all share the desire to develop the tools. This will not be the end. The committee has made amendments to original legislation that was put forward through a committee or a task force process. This bill will go through the Senate process. I would assure members of the House, and I refer in particular to the interchange that just took place, there will be other mechanisms undoubtedly, other tools that will be developed through the continuing process of developing the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666606">I am sure there are people who are watching who only see bits and pieces of the debate. People do not always see the total context within which the debate on legislation is taking place. I would like to provide a chronology to put things in context.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666607">Spam is a serious concern for individual Canadians and businesses. Back in 2004-05, the then Liberal government established a task force to look at anti-spam legislation. That task force brought forward recommendations which generally paralleled the bill before us. Those recommendations were aimed at prohibiting the sending of spam without prior consent as a first principle. The second principle was that it would be an offence to use false or misleading statements to disguise the origins or true intent of an email.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666608">The task force led to a number of key recommendations. I think there were 22 recommendations in all. The government of the day established a series of round tables to seek input from the business community and the community in general.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1666609">At that time, the specific recommendations were to prohibit the sending of spam without prior consent as the first principle, to prohibit the use of false or misleading statements disguising the origins or intent of an email, and to prohibit the installation of unauthorized programs. Spam artists are so cunning that if a person does give clearance to a misleading and disguised email, information with respect to even the person's passwords can be made available, which gives access to the person's email content, websites, et cetera. The final principle that was established through that task force was to prohibit the unauthorized collection of personal information or email addresses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666610">This bill has all of the elements of those task force recommendations and looks to implement the recommendations of that task force. As I have said, this is not a Liberal approach or a Conservative approach; in fact, it appears that the bill has the support of all parties in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666611">There is one aspect of the bill that is different from the regime that was put forward back in 2004-05 under those recommendations, and that is with respect to fines and the implications with respect to what may happen if one is found guilty of violating the intent of the legislation. The fines for these violations can go up to a maximum of $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses. It establishes rules for warrants, for information, as was discussed by the last speaker and in questions, and in particular, that information being available through warrants during investigations and injunctions that can be sought on spam activity while under investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666612">The bill also establishes the private right of action, allowing individuals and businesses the ability to seek damages from the perpetrators of spam. That is a particularly important principle. We have talked about victims and victims' statements during criminal proceedings and recently with the bill that firms up the interventions with respect to parole and the ongoing communication with those who have been victimized with respect to how the provisions of parole are carried out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666613">This bill also attempts to err on the side of victims. It gives them the ability to seek damages from the perpetrators of spam, depending upon the nature of invasion of privacy and the activity that took place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666614">It was pointed out that the committee had some problems with flaws in this bill. Clause 6 seemed to be a little too broadly written and, as has been pointed out by other speakers, could suppress a very legitimate part of our application of technology and the whole sector. It could impose an adverse position with respect to those who are creative within the technology, the rules of the technology and so on. It was pointed out that the committee was not satisfied to that extent. However, amendments were made to the bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666615">The bill also maintains a very strong and some have said heavy-handed position, but given the nature of the illegal activity going on, I think that all of the House would concur with the committee's intent to make those who are guilty suffer.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="20">(1820)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1666616">Generally speaking, those in the stakeholder groups were not satisfied with the original task force recommendations, and there may be some who are still not satisfied with the bill. However, as I have indicated, it has gone through the committee stage, amendments have been made and at this point I think we have to err on the side of those who use their email and other technology for positive and high value-added activity and go after those who would victimize those who are using the technology.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666618"> I wonder if the member could confirm that class action provisions might be applicable as far as the bill is concerned. It seems to me that if we are dealing on an individual basis, it is a much more positive approach if we could have the bill affected by class action lawsuits, whereby people could take action on the part of a whole group of people who were being victimized by certain types of spam activity.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666621">The bill leans toward the concept of victims' rights. If victims' rights can be characterized through class action, and in other aspects of law, both civil and criminal, then that can happen. This is embarking on new ground. There will be many who will be viewing the intent of the bill and the legislation. It may be contested through the courts, but certainly the provisions with respect to victims would leave the door open, I would say from a lay person's perspective, to class actions. That would mitigate the cost associated with an action. Also, with the kind of publicity that is entrenched in that approach it would do what the bill, in terms of its intent is trying to do. It would put those who would use spam for defrauding and other criminal purposes on notice that more than individual court proceedings could occur. Class actions are very costly. The repercussions could be serious and would act as a deterrent, I would think. However, I am sure that the member would have better suggestions than I would from a legal perspective.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666625">When I review the bill and look at fines of a maximum of $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses, it would seem that is a pretty serious step toward the objective the member has which I inferred from his question.

              <ParaText id="1666626">The whole process through the bill establishes a framework for investigation. The notion that there are rules to be established with respect to warrants, for information during an investigation and so on, certainly provides a framework which will make the bill a much greater deterrent, if it is fully understood, than exists at this time. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666627">Mr. Speaker, in 2004-05 a Liberal government anti-spam task force consulted the public widely and had round tables with stakeholders. This important bill to limit spam did not come out of the blue. There were four major recommendations from the task force. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666628">The first is prohibiting the sending spam without the prior consent of recipients. I cannot imagine anyone in the public who would not want this to come into effect very quickly. We all get hundreds and hundreds of nuisance and unwarranted spam. People must be dreaming for the day when they will no longer be sent. Quite often it is the very same message with a different title, which I will talk about a little later. This will be a very popular part of the bill for businesses and anyone who uses a computers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666629">The second is the use of false or misleading statements disguising the origin or true intent of the email. I am sure everyone has received emails that they have opened by accident because they are very clever titled such as “You haven't paid your bill” or other more creative ways of getting us to open the email. Then there is the very same email we received one hundred times trying to sell us the very same product.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666630">The third major recommendation from the Liberal task force is the installation of unauthorized programs prohibiting that and no one would want that to occur.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666631">The fourth is the unauthorized collection of personal information or email addresses. That is very significant. Canadians and businesses do not want the unauthorized collection of their personal information. All kinds of damage can be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666632">We only need to go back to the debates we have had recently on commercial crime to see the huge multi-billion dollars in damages and lives ruined because information of individuals has been used for fraudulent purposes. Computer technology is relatively new. In a previous job before I became a member of Parliament there were no computers in business. In that it is a new technology, people, especially seniors who were not used to this throughout their lives, could easily be hoodwinked into giving personal information, which is then be used to victimize them. It is very important this not be allowed to continue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666633">Let us look at the scenario where millions of unauthorized, unwanted messages or spam go through the Internet. How important is the Internet to today's life? It is really a backbone for many people and for many businesses. The whole way that our society functions—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666656">She said: Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="128315" Type="2">Etobicoke—Lakeshore</Affiliation>, and I want to thank all of the Speakers for granting this important debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666657">This past weekend I was inundated with calls and emails from MPs, asking questions and describing the situation on the ground in their ridings. I think it is important that tonight we get to tell those stories and call on the government to respond to this crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666658">Peter Newman has said that politics in Canada is the art of making the necessary possible. Determining what is necessary and fighting for it is political. In public health there is a role for politicians of all political stripes to fight for the necessary resources to protect the health and safety of Canadians, and ensure that the priorities of the government of the day are in line with the needs of Canadians. This is not partisan, but it is political.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666659">When the minister stated that there was no pandemic plan before the Conservative government took office, that is partisan. Canada has had a pandemic preparedness plan since 1988. In 2003 we learned the lessons of SARS, and quickly put in place a response to David Naylor's report: collaboration, cooperation, communication and clarity of who does what, when. We put in place the Public Health Agency of Canada, appointed Dr. David Butler-Jones as the first Chief Public Health Officer for Canada, and established the public health network for Canada where all 13 jurisdictions would be able to plan together with the federal government for the public health of all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666660">Canada's pandemic plan was one of the best in the world. The plan ensured a supply of vaccines for all Canadians and adequate stockpiles of Tamiflu. These were good planning decisions. Our criticism is not with the plan, but with the failure to adapt the plan quickly to respond to this new, novel virus, and the execution of the response to the pandemic itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666661">In the 2004 budget we put in place a trust fund of $100 million for the provinces to build the capacity for front line public health. In 2007 the Conservative government cancelled that fund. The 2006 budget booked $400 million for pandemic response. We now find out that the government put the reserve fund into five annual packages of $80 million, and each year without a pandemic, the money has disappeared. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666662">The <Affiliation DbId="128707" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> has continued to state that she is working with the provinces and territories, yet she unilaterally decided that the provinces and territories would pay for 40% of the costs of the vaccine and for all of the costs of the administration of the vaccination program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666663">The provinces and territories have been asking for help. The government has refused to listen. All summer we have been seeking assurance that there were in place the resources and the capacity on the ground to get the 50.4 million doses of vaccines that had been ordered into the arms of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666664">There seems to be some confusion between the role of the <Affiliation DbId="128707" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> and the role of the Chief Public Health Officer for Canada. The Chief Public Health Officer for Canada has the responsibility to find a consensus with his counterparts on the science and then give the best possible advice to Canadians. Canadians needed clear and unambiguous messages. Instead, there were too many opinions and conflicting guidelines, and the resulting dangerous confusion. His job is also to give the best possible advice to the <Affiliation DbId="128707" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation>, including his assessment of the need for additional resources for communication and/or improving front line public health capacity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666665">The <Affiliation DbId="128707" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> has the responsibility to act on his advice, listen to her provincial and territorial counterparts, and then go to cabinet and make her case to be able to deliver what is needed to protect the health and safety of Canadians. Wrapping itself in some constitutional cocoon is a dangerous approach for the federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666666">There is a difference between health and health care delivery. In 2003 David Naylor's report on the lessons learned from SARS quoted Disraeli: “the care of public health is the first duty of the statesman”. It is time for the minister to do her job and help her minister of health colleagues across the country. so that their public health authorities can deal with this health emergency now. It is time for statesmanship, not time for an ideologically-based mantra of “not a federal responsibility”. She is Canada's <Affiliation DbId="128707" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666667">The lack of an effective national communication plan has meant that doctors and nurses administering the vaccines are spending time answering questions that could and should have been answered all summer. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="10">(1910)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1666668">As information changes, the federal government has a responsibility to spend the dollars necessary to ensure that Canadians truly understand the facts and what is expected of them. The public education campaigns from the NHS in the U.K. or the CDC in the U.S. demonstrate what a proper public education campaign should look like, especially the effectiveness of the campaign targeted to children, which is totally missing in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666669">Last weekend it was the father of a child who had died from H1N1 who explained that shortness of breath was not a normal symptom of influenza. He said he wished he had known that earlier. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666670">Since June, the doctors in Manitoba have been recommending a public awareness campaign to make sure that every Canadian with influenza who is experiencing shortness of breath would immediately seek medical attention. They were worried that the morbidity and mortality of patients they had seen in Winnipeg could have been dramatically reduced if they had presented to hospital earlier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666671">Two weeks ago, we asked a number of local medical officers of health across the country if they felt ready for the vaccine rollout. They had been given no certainty of the quantity or the starting date of the supply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666672"> They described a total absence of sensitivity of the operational realities, the logistics of storage and security, let alone setting up clinics with so little notice. They described a total absence of central leadership, a lack of clarity and no commitment to the additional resources that would be necessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666673">They insisted that the front lines had to know what to expect and what not to expect. They had no idea of the costs and no idea of what would be reimbursed. They were worried that the demonstration projects had not been built and that no money had arrived on the front lines. Medical officers of health were being asked to go to their local boards of health or regional health authorities and municipal councils handcuffed by the lack of information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666674">This summer when we drew attention to the lack of planning and resources for aboriginal communities, the minister was telling us that 90% of the communities were prepared while the grand chiefs and our personal experience were telling us something quite different. The unfortunate body bag incident followed a lack of response to the ongoing criticisms by the first nations community of the local regional office of Health Canada. The government responded well by appointing the respected Dr. Paul Gully to First Nations and Inuit Health and things have improved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666675">There are many questions that will have to be answered later. Having only one production line in one company available for all the vaccines needed for Canadians has clearly caused delays. Priority must be to have the shortest possible gap between the arrival of a pandemic and the time when a significant percentage of the population has been immunized.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666676">I cannot believe that any MP on any side of the House could look at the lineups in his or her riding and be able to say that this response to the pandemic is being executed properly or blame some other jurisdiction. We need to redouble our efforts as politicians to immediately secure the resources necessary to help local public health units get on with the vaccination campaign, additional funds for school-based campaigns, and hire back retired nurses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666677">We need to ensure, as soon as we have the promised three million vaccines, that we get them into the arms of Canadians as quickly as possible. We also need to ensure that hospitals and family doctors in our areas are confident that they have the resources necessary to look after Canadians who do get sick. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666678">In a visit to B.C. Women's Hospital on Friday, I was truly impressed. Its patients are all immunized and it certainly seems ready.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666679">It is indeed a fine line between our due diligence in holding the government to account and partisan grandstanding. We believe that the government has a huge role to play in the response to this pandemic. We will do our job and we want the government to do its job.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666686">The fact of the matter is that the government has not taken care of the crisis the way it needs to do.

              <ParaText id="1666687">I would ask the member to comment on whether or not she agrees with me that the government should be stepping up and saying that the administration of the medication, the financing of the programs to get the vaccine to people when they need it should be financed on the same basis as the vaccine itself.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666699">This debate is not simply about an epidemic; it is a debate about the proper role and function of government. The role of government is to prepare citizens, to lead citizens and to inform them. In all three dimensions, the government has failed in its duties. I will begin with the government's failure to prepare. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666700">The H1N1 flu first appeared on April 23, in Mexico. On April 27, I asked the first question in the House, namely: where was the government's plan to meet this challenge? But there has not been any plan since then. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666701">The Conservatives waited before ordering vaccines. The United States ordered vaccines on May 25. France did so on July 16. But the Conservative government waited until August 6. That delay is critical. It shows a lack of leadership and a blatant lack of preparation. Thirty-five countries ordered their vaccines before Canada did.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1666702">The Conservatives began vaccination later than other countries. China, Australia, the United States, Sweden, Japan, the United Kingdom, all began vaccinations before our country did. Canada did not begin vaccinations until October 26. The U.S. began administering the vaccine on October 5, before Canadian trials had even begun.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666703">Two weeks ago, the <Affiliation DbId="128707" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> said the vaccine would be available to all Canadians in early November, and now she says it will not be available until Christmas. We have discovered that there is not an adequate supply for next week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666704">The Conservatives did not order non-adjuvanted vaccine for pregnant women until it was too late, and they provided extremely confusing advice at all times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666705">This failure to properly inform the public has become a source of enormous anxiety to Canadian families. They do not know what public information to believe. This is producing anguish in families that is the direct responsibility of the government.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1666706">Earlier, I referred to a lack of preparation, but there was also a lack of leadership. The provinces and territories asked the federal government for additional resources. Four hundred million dollars were allocated in the 2006 budget—which amounts to $80 million annually—to help the provinces and municipalities face this challenge. So far, there has been no reply and no cooperation on the part of the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666707">Finally, I want to mention a simple reality: epidemics do not care about jurisdictions, about territories. The municipal, provincial and federal levels of government must work in a spirit of consultation and consensus building, and it is the federal government's responsibility to develop a national plan so that all stakeholders can be interconnected. This is what is lacking in the government's approach. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1666708">Instead of taking responsibility, the government blames everybody else. The government blames the drug company because there is not enough supply for next week. The government blames the provinces and territories. “We do not deliver health care,” the government says. We understand that, but the role of a national government is to provide the planning framework in which everybody does his or her job, because as I said, epidemics do not care about jurisdictions. What the national government is there to do is to bring people together. The government has failed to do that consistently since the beginning of the crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666709"> The question now is when will the government own up and take responsibility? When will the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> begin to exercise the leadership that is his responsibility here? Why does he refuse to lead? Why does the entire government shift responsibility to the drug companies, to the provinces, to the municipalities, anybody it can instead of standing up and doing what the Government of Canada ought to be doing?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666710">Finally, there is the failure to inform, the failure to prepare, the failure to lead. This is a government that has spent something like 10 times more on its own publicity, publicizing its own highly partisan infrastructure program than it has spent on public health information. This is the most astonishing failure of all of the government's failures. Clean, clear public information that everybody can understand is the right of every Canadian citizen. We could have avoided the anguish in all the Canadian households had the government done its job. It failed to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666711">Ultimately, this is not just about an epidemic; this is about the proper role of government in our society, the proper role of a federal government. The government has failed to do its job, which is why we are having this debate tonight.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666725">Madam Speaker, I am always pleased to provide the House with an update on the efforts of health portfolios to respond to the H1N1 flu virus outbreak. The reason for that is I am very proud of and stand behind all of our efforts to date, especially considering H1N1 is a novel virus. It is not something we have encountered before.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666726">This new form of influenza is causing sickness and death in demographic groups that are usually most resistant to seasonal viruses and other disease outbreaks. For the first time in a long time, we are seeing school-aged children, youth and working-age adults hit hardest by this virus. More often it is the very young and very old who are most at risk of severe cases of the flu. With seasonal flu, over 90% of deaths and about 60% of hospitalizations occur in people older than 65. I would like to focus today on the facts about our response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666727">In April we received a report of these illnesses from Mexico. Our international reputation is such that when Mexican officials realized they had a problem, they called Canada first. We indicated that we would be happy to assist and immediately began doing so. We also began working immediately with the World Health Organization and our international and Canadian partners to respond quickly to this developing situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666728">Since that day, the Government of Canada's actions have been unprecedented and we continue to demonstrate the leadership that Canadians, governments, health professionals and organizations are looking for during an outbreak. Let me provide just a few examples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666729">This is a very unique, new virus that could not be identified by a traditional method. However, the Public Health Agency's National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg is an international leader in infectious disease diagnostics and research. Our lab had processes in place to identify emerging pathogens along with cutting edge technology that not all labs have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666730"> Once we received specimens from Mexico, we got to work right away. Our National Microbiology Laboratory had test results within 24 hours. We mapped the genetic code of the Canadian and Mexican flu viruses, the first time that was done in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666731"> The scientific excellence and leadership has been the hallmark of our response to the H1N1 influenza virus outbreak.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666732"> On the epidemiological side, we implemented heightened surveillance through FluWatch and began providing support to affected areas, including first nations and Inuit communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666733">We began holding regular media briefings. In fact, since the spring, I have held over 41 media briefings. This is unprecedented and it is consistent with our commitment to keep Canadians informed as part of the pandemic plan. In addition, the Chief Public Health Officer of Canada and myself have conducted hundreds of media interviews.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666734">The 1 800 O Canada information line has received calls requesting over 300,000 copies of the government's H1N1 preparedness guide and almost 50,000 of the guides have been downloaded from the Public Health Agency website. Radio and television ads are airing nationally, focusing on personal preparedness and vaccine information in the weeks to come. We will continue to roll out our multimedia, multi-phased citizen readiness marketing campaign.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666735">In order to ensure that my colleagues on the other side of the House are kept up to date, we have provided over 40 briefings for opposition members of Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666736">Last summer, after consultation with the provinces, territories and international partners and suppliers, we purchased enough doses of the H1N1 vaccine for every Canadian who needed and wanted it. In addition, we have ensured that pregnant women have access to unadjuvanted vaccine, following the advice of the World Health Organization.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666737">The rollout was planned for early November, however, because of the hard work of many people in my department, who have been working 24/7, we were able to announce, on October 21, the authorization of the adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine. This means that provinces and territories were able to begin last week, on October 26, the largest vaccination campaign in our country's history. To date, six million doses of adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine have been delivered to the provinces and territories. That is currently more H1N1 vaccine per capita than any other country in the world.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="35">(1935)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1666738">We have sufficient vaccines for high-risk populations that need it. Many more Canadians will continue to get their shots over the coming weeks as more vaccine becomes available. Let me make one point very clear. There is not a shortage of vaccine. Every Canadian will be able to have the vaccine by Christmas. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666739">There has been a tremendous uptake since the campaign began. We are encouraged by the fact that Canadians see the importance of being vaccinated against this pandemic flu. Provinces and territories are reporting many thousands of Canadians getting their shots. Right now, jurisdictions are giving more vaccine per day than they have ever given in history. There will be enough H1N1 vaccine available in Canada for everyone who needs and wants to be immunized. Not a single person will be left out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666740">Because we know that it would be impossible to vaccinate everyone in the country at one time, the Government of Canada, in co-operation with the provinces and territories, jointly determined sequencing guidelines for the distribution of the H1N1 flu vaccine. It is important for these guidelines to be implemented and respected. That is why we have started distributing the vaccine ahead of schedule so health care workers and Canadians at high risk of severe complications could be first in line to receive the vaccine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666741">In addition, I would like to remind colleagues that the northern isolated communities of Nunavut and the Northwest Territories have received their entire allotment of adjuvanted vaccine and will be able to have their populations vaccinated within two weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666742"> Our goal is to have vaccinated every Canadian who needs and wants it by Christmas. This will be an incredible help to us in the fight against the spread of H1N1.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666743">However, in broad terms, all of this is just the beginning. The flu season in Canada traditionally lasts until April. I know my colleagues, the parliamentary secretary to myself and members of Parliament will provide more details on our response so far, but I will also say that all of these efforts are a testament to the planning and to the strengthened systems we have nurtured over the past few years. Our response to the H1N1 flu virus began as soon as we were informed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666744">As the House knows, the World Health Organization officially declared an H1N1 pandemic in June. What is different this time around relative to previous pandemics is that we are better prepared than we have ever been before.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666745"> The reason is the Government of Canada is working from a strong framework, the Canadian pandemic influenza plan. It is a plan built on years of collaboration with provinces, territories and the medical community. Its goals are to minimize serious illness and overall deaths and to minimize social disruption among Canadians as a result of an influenza pandemic. That plan is constantly being fine-tuned. We are continuing to work on all the recommended preparedness activities and outstanding issues it outlines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666746">To help in rolling out pandemic plans and response, we continue to develop and update guidance documents for such concerns as clinical care for pregnant women. In fact, just last week, we released three new sets of guidelines. We released guidelines on how Canadians can reduce the spread of H1N1 flu virus while they are traveling. These guidelines help clarify how passengers, crews, travel agencies and operators can help reduce the spread of infection on planes, trains, ferries and buses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666747">We also issued guidance to assist those in remote and isolated communities, homes to some of our most vulnerable population. Our guidance on clinical management of patients with influenza-like illnesses will help doctors, nurses and other health care providers provide the care that residents in remote and isolated communities need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666748">The third guidance document will assist remote and isolated communities across Canada develop a plan for mass immunization. This is critical because health care services in many remote and isolated communities are carried out in small to medium-sized nursing stations and health centres by a small number of staff.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666749">Because of the unique health challenges that remote and isolated communities face, we will be issuing several more guidance documents over the coming weeks to ensure that those who live far from the large urban centres in southern Canada receive the health care services they need to stay healthy.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="40">(1940)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1666750">Other supporting documents are being updated based on more recent data and experience we have seen during the influenza outbreak. This has laid the foundation for us. It is the strongest example possible of the spirit of collaboration. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666751">Since the outset I have stressed the importance of collaboration in every action taken to manage the outbreak on behalf of Canadians. Our response has been supported by systematic ongoing contact with the World Health Organization and other international partners. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666752">Within our borders we have made a concerted, coordinated effort to share information and lessons learned with our provincial and territorial counterparts. Experts and decision-makers from all jurisdictions from the entire spectrum of public health management have come together to ensure an appropriate and timely response to the outbreak. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666753">From day one we have been working with first nations leaders and provinces. We are working to ensure that communities have everything they need in a timely manner based on the best public health advice, and of course we are committed to making sure first nations have the support they need to protect their communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666754">As we move forward we are increasing efforts to make sure H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines get to those Canadians who need and want them the most. I am confident that the actions taken so far along with our continued efforts this fall and winter will continue to serve Canadians well. While the course of this pandemic may have been unexpected, we have demonstrated our ability to adapt quickly and effectively to rapidly changing events.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666755">On October 29, we learned from our supplier GSK that the quantity of vaccine to be shipped to the provinces and territories would be, for the short term, much lower than expected. While we had known before that there might be less vaccine available, we had no idea until then the extent of the shortfall. When I found out and when we found out, we advised the provinces and territories immediately. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666756">The temporary reduction in supply was caused by the fact that GSK can produce only one type of vaccine, adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted, at a time. It needed to shut down production of adjuvanted vaccine in order to comply with its commitment to producing non-adjuvanted vaccine for pregnant women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666757">This temporary shutdown combined with the earlier-than-expected authorization and roll-out of the vaccine caused the reduction we are now seeing. However, GSK assures us that it will be back up to providing the provinces and territories with millions of doses over the coming weeks. We are in constant contact with GSK on its production schedule. We have begun posting information on the expected supply on our website and sharing this information with the provinces and territories. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666758">We are dealing with a very new disease and we have been working and will continue to work as quickly as possible given these circumstances. This government's planning efforts have paid off. No matter what else comes our way, we are well prepared. We plan to continue regular media briefings and get information out to Canadians quickly and effectively through advertising and otherwise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666759">We are committed to ongoing collaboration, transparency and communication. These are the tools that will help us prevent the spread of H1N1 and manage the outbreak and get us through this pandemic.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666763">Madam Speaker, since April, I have been working with the provinces and territories in the rollout of the pandemic plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666764">I was a territorial health minister for five years and know full well, intimately, the plan that was developed back in 2006 and agreed to by provinces and territories. There were lots of lessons learned at that time, and during the SARS outbreak, to develop a plan for Canada. When it was time to implement the plan, provinces and territories became aware of the presence of H1N1, over a weekend, from the confirmed lab results in Mexico. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666765">In terms of why August was the date chosen, the chief public health officers and medical officers across the country through their ministries advised us at the time that it was very important for us in Canada to complete the production of the regular flu vaccine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666766">We know full well that in Canada about 4,000 Canadians die of the regular flu. The medical experts recommended that it was important to complete the vaccine against that. So that was completed over the summer months. As soon as that was done, the production of the H1N1 vaccine started, again based on the medical advice of the provinces and territories.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666767">Something else that was developed, which my good friend from the NDP took part in, was a gathering in Winnipeg of a group of medical experts and chief medical officers to look at the cases we were seeing in Canada, the more serious cases, and what some of the underlying conditions were. They brought together a number of experts across the country and international community to develop the sequencing guidelines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666768">We recognized at the time that we could not immunize 33 million Canadians at one time, and it was important to target the most vulnerable. That guideline was established for the provinces and territories to use in the rollout of the first six million doses of vaccine distributed to the provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666769">I will continue to work with the provinces to roll out the vaccine to them as soon as it comes through from GSK.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666795">Madam Speaker, like my colleagues, I am pleased to participate in this emergency debate on the second wave of the H1N1 pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666796">It goes without saying that there is an urgent need for this debate, since in Quebec and in all the provinces of Canada, we are seeing lines of people waiting to be vaccinated but unable to get the vaccine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666797">I heard the minister and the government members accusing the opposition of playing politics with this debate. I can understand some of the government's criticisms of the Liberal Party, because, unfortunately, the Liberals used a 10 percenter to send a document to aboriginal communities, resurrecting the body bag issue, when the communities had already accepted the government's apologies. However, I do not appreciate having the minister associate me and my party with this or having her accuse us of simply trying to take advantage of the situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666798">Throughout consideration of this issue, ever since the WHO declared the pandemic a level six on June 11, we have been trying in every way possible to cooperate with the government and the Public Health Agency in order to ensure that the people of Quebec and people across Canada receive the best services, the best information and the best care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666799">That has always been our motivation. However, we see the confusion surrounding this vaccination. It is important to get answers from this government since it is up to us to relay accurate information to our constituents. We want to ensure, through our interventions, that our constituents have access to the vaccine, the antivirals and the information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666800">In August, the members of the Standing Committee on Health held a meeting to get an update from the government on the status of its plan. At the time, I already mentioned to the minister that I felt this plan was being disclosed bit by bit. It is hard to work with a piecemeal plan because we end up reacting to situations instead of providing the public with clear guidelines. The public was entitled to the facts because when it comes to H1N1, it is their health that is at stake.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666801">We know that some patients with this disease have had very serious respiratory problems and that a number of deaths have been associated with this flu pandemic, hence the need for a clear plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666802">However, it seems that the government does not want to give us a clear indication of the availability of doses of vaccine that will be distributed to Quebec and the provinces. We know that in Quebec and in the provinces structures are already in place or are being implemented in order to optimize the doses received at the mass vaccination centres. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666803">The fact that the Chief Public Health Officer and the minister only found out last Thursday that Quebec would receive approximately 300,000 fewer doses of vaccine indicates a lack of foresight. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="55">(1955)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1666804">To inform people at the last minute, while they are waiting in line to get a vaccination, that they will not be able to get it the next week or in coming weeks shows a lack of preparedness. It simply makes no sense that they did not know beforehand. The Chief Public Health Officer seemed to even say that vaccination clinics will have to close. That just does not make sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666805">In my opinion, the confusion began when the government delayed approval of the vaccine. Other countries had approved the vaccine before Canada. The United States, Australia and France approved a vaccine on September 13, 18 and 25 respectively. At that point, Canadians began saying that the government must have delayed approval because there was something not right with the vaccine. Conspiracy theories surfaced on the Internet about how components of the vaccine or the adjuvant were harmful to health. People began to have doubts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666806">But when people understood, they all wanted the vaccine. We did educate people, and I do not accept the government's suggestion that we did not do our jobs. My Bloc Québécois and I did everything we could using scientific evidence to reassure our fellow citizens that the vaccine is safe. Once we did that, a huge number of our people wanted to get the vaccine. Once again, the government should not have based its action plan on the assumption that a certain percentage of the population would get the vaccine. It should have acted on the assumption that the vast majority of people would want it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666807">Earlier, the minister said that the vaccine supplier—the sole supplier, I should point out—completed its production of seasonal flu vaccine before starting to produce H1N1 flu vaccine because seasonal flu can be fatal and we need the right tools to deal with it properly. I agree with that. However, a government with a clear and precise plan would have sought out other avenues or even other suppliers to ensure that all of our fellow citizens receive the vaccine while it mattered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666808">At the moment, we are right in the middle of the second wave of the H1N1 pandemic, and many of our fellow citizens are not yet vaccinated. We know that those at low risk of complications will not be vaccinated until December. Earlier, the minister said that everyone would be vaccinated by Christmas. However, people are coming to see us and they are saying that by Christmas, it will all be over. They are wondering if they will even need it by then. They are wondering whether they will already have come down with this flu by Christmas. These are legitimate questions. The government has to give people the answers they need.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="00">(2000)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1666809">The minister also said again in her speech that production of adjuvanted vaccines for the general public had to be stopped so that GSK could produce unadjuvanted vaccines for pregnant women. But I believe I heard that the World Health Organization and government representatives have said that the adjuvanted vaccine could also be suitable for pregnant women. This message will have to be clarified.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666810">Last Monday, the government announced that it was purchasing 200,000 doses of unadjuvanted vaccine from an Australian company. When the government announces that it is buying unadjuvanted vaccine for pregnant women, people can easily think that the government has found an alternative way to distribute unadjuvanted vaccine to Quebec and the provinces for pregnant women. But now, a week later, we are finding out that that was not the real reason the government was buying unadjuvanted vaccine from Australia. Here again, the way in which the government is going about procuring vaccine is not clear. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666811">All these questions are relevant because, as I said earlier, people expect to be vaccinated quickly because we are right in the middle of the second wave of the H1N1 pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666812">We know that the federal government has a $400 million special fund created by the previous government for use in the event of a pandemic. We have watched the Conservative government whittle away at this money, withdrawing $80 million a year because the fund had not been used to respond to a pandemic in the previous 12 months. But this money could be made available to Quebec and the provinces to improve information sharing about the vaccination campaign, for example. Or it could be transferred to Quebec and the provinces to help them hire more nurses to administer the vaccine when it arrives. Of course, all that needs to be part of a clear, coherent plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666813">Earlier, I heard my colleagues talking about the situation on native reserves and in first nations communities, and rightly so. When the health committee examined this issue in August, first nations representatives, including grand chiefs, came to tell us about a disturbing situation, one that this government should be ashamed of. It is also disgraceful for the Liberals, who formed the previous government, since one of the reasons this virus, the flu virus, has been able to spread so quickly in those communities is due to overcrowding, in addition to the fact that certain isolated communities do not have access to potable water.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="05">(2005)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1666814">When, in 2009, our citizens do not have access to potable water in a country that former Prime Minister Chrétien called “the most best country in the world”, that makes no sense. One might wonder about the government's real desire to tackle this problem, which has been an issue for many years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666815">I remember asking government officials if they had only recently realized that certain areas within Canada did not have safe drinking water. Of course, we were told that measures would be put in place, but they had to be introduced gradually, over time, and so on. As we can see with the first wave of the flu, the fact that this aspect was neglected is making that population even more vulnerable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666816"> The Speaker is signaling that I have only three minutes left. My colleague across the floor wishes to give me 15 minutes, Madam Speaker. Is he right? Do I really have 15 minutes left? Of course not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666817">In conclusion, I would simply like to come back to the fact that the minister talked about the schedule for ordering the vaccine. How is it possible that we have known since June 11 that there was a level 6 pandemic, but that the 50 million doses were not ordered until August? How is it possible that the government waited until September to order the adjuvanted vaccine, when we could have easily ordered the unadjuvanted vaccines earlier, while we were waiting to hear whether the adjuvanted vaccine was approved or safe?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666818">That would have surely put us in a better position to help those who simply want to be vaccinated. It would be completely irresponsible on our part not to question the minister and the government about this. It is unfortunate; I know. The minister does not like it, but it is clear that deep down, we have some questions, as we all sit here in this House, and we hear from the agency and from experts. I can only imagine what Canadians are thinking, as they receive sometimes contradictory information and wonder when they will be able to get vaccinated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666819">I would like to thank my colleagues for their attention, and I encourage everyone in this House to participate in this important emergency debate on the H1N1 pandemic. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666821">In actual fact, at the health committee, as the member is very well aware, we have had aboriginal people come and testify, including Grand Chief Ron Evans, from Manitoba, from my province, who is a great leader in Manitoba. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666822">There was an issue, right at the beginning, about body bags. The minister was very careful to make sure that it was examined and reported. It was found out that the nurses themselves had ordered the body bags because they wanted to ensure they had a lot of all sorts of pandemic supplies, and the body bags were there as part of those pandemic supplies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666823">When Grand Chief Ron Evans came to the health committee last time, he applauded the minister and said that indeed things were coming along very well, that things were much better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666824">However, the saddest day on which I have ever been on a committee was when the grand chief held up a 10 percenter, and on the front page was a picture of a morgue. On the back of that ten percenter was a picture of a little girl, holding her head, with a thermometer in her mouth. And this came from the Liberal Party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666825">I would ask the member how he felt when this kind of thing happened. Did he think that opposition parties had politicized this pandemic, right in front of all the aboriginal people, to try to make points?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666827"> In fact, when Grand Chief Evans came to meet with us at the committee, all of his comments dealt with the support he had received from his province and private agencies to put together a kit so it could be distributed. That was the gratifying aspect of his comments: in a nutshell, preparation plans in the event of a major problem were ready. In fact, we have heard this on several occasions from officials of this House and from government employees. I was completely bowled over to see the Grand Chief hold up that ten percenter, because to me it did not belong there. As parliamentarians, we prefer to offer accurate information and make sure that our fellow citizens have access to a vaccine or appropriate kits, for example. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666829"> As early as 2004-05, the World Health Organization said we must prepare for a pandemic flu. In 2006, then UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said we must come together and prepare. In 2007, the World Health Organization warned against complacency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666830">It was the job of the government to maintain a current pandemic plan and resources to respond. In the 2006 budget, $400 million dollars were set aside, and $80 million has disappeared since.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666831">My question, though, is that the second wave of the pandemic was announced on a Friday, in Ontario and in British Columbia. The vaccine rollout began last week. There has been confusion, frustration and lineups. The people who were vaccinated this past week will not be protected for 10 to 14 days. There is a slowdown this week.

              <ParaText id="1666833">Madam Speaker, my colleague is somewhat correct. The question is a good one. Is Christmas early enough, when we are currently in the second wave of the pandemic? That is what the debate this evening is about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666834">The government realized that the supplier might not be able to supply the hoped-for doses because it had only one production line. The government denies it, but on the other hand, it seemed like it wanted to blame the company because the company had overestimated its production. That really does not make sense when distribution has to be planned during the period when the pandemic is in full swing. We cannot play with words like this when ultimately it is the public’s health at stake.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666841">Yes, Quebec's health and social service centres had their action plans in place, but they could not vaccinate people without vaccine. There is no question that the federal government is responsible for providing vaccine to the provinces. It cannot hide from that. It cannot wash its hands of the whole affair and give all kinds of excuses for why the vaccines are not available. The government should have had a detailed timeline from the very beginning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666842"> Once again just now, I asked the minister about this. I asked her if she could provide clearer answers about when previous levels—400,000 doses per week in Quebec—would be reached again. She could not even give me an answer. I asked her a straightforward question during this debate and she could not give me an answer. That inability to answer is what makes people wonder when they are going to get the vaccine. My question is absolutely pertinent.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666844">We are facing a very serious situation. I very much appreciate that the Liberal member put forward the motion for this emergency debate. This is obviously an urgent matter for those people, those families waiting in line that we see on television. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666846">As part of this serious debate, I wish to make some suggestions. I remember my conversation with the mayor of Kitimat, Mrs. Monahan. She had just learned that all the schools in Kitimat were to be closed. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666847">I was speaking with the mayor of Kitimat on the phone who had just learned about the closing of a mill and the loss of 500 jobs, which is pretty much an economic disaster. She told me she had just heard 10 minutes before that schools were having to be closed in Kitimat because of high absenteeism. I was thinking of the families who are now having to look after their kids at home in the midst of that situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666848">I am thinking of the nurses who work with the homeless people in our communities, people like Cathy Crowe in Toronto underlines how many homeless people are likely to be very severely affected by this virus as it spreads through the shelters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666849">I was thinking of the chief from northern Manitoba who met with me and the member for <Affiliation DbId="128733" Type="2">Churchill</Affiliation> and only hours after that conversation received a phone call that one of the family members had passed away and had to return immediately home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666850">These are immensely personal situations that we are dealing with. I think at this particular time we all have to work together. One of things that we have to do together is to ensure that the vaccines that are available are distributed as quickly as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666851">I had the opportunity to chair the Toronto board of health for many years and so I have a little familiarity with what is involved. I am hearing from the people in the public health sector that one of the problems they are facing is that they really do not have the resources to deliver the vaccinations on the ground and they are having to reallocate from other parts of their budget and other parts of their activity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666852">I remember thinking about what happens when we have a weather disaster, a flood or an ice storm. We actually have a system in place where 90% of the funding is going to be provided by the federal government. In other words, if one is a local decision maker, one can say, “We don't have to worry about the money. It's going to be taken care of. Let's get this plan going and move as quickly as we can to try to prevent as many problems as possible”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666853">This would be my key proposition to advance. It is time for the federal government to step forward and say, “We're ready to backstop the financial requirements of the delivery of the vaccine so that people can get the help as quickly as possible”. I sincerely request the government to accept that suggestion in good faith.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666854">I believe that if the government were to talk to some of the provincial officials, and I know they are having these conversations because so have I. And I can say they are worried about the costs and they are not able to do as much as they might be able to do if they knew the federal government would stand behind them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666855">If we can prevent tens of thousands of people from becoming sick, I know I will be able to sleep better at night knowing we did everything that we could.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1666856">Therefore, we propose that the government inform the provinces and territories that the funds will be available to deliver the vaccine to families, clinics and doctors. My second suggestion is that more advertising is needed. That is definitely true.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1666857">We have too many people who just do not have the information they need. They walk up to me on the street and ask me questions. I am not a medical expert, so I am not really in a position to answer some of the questions they are asking me. I am not going to try to lay them all out here in the time I have available. I think the members in the chamber know what I am talking about. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666858">Therefore, I would hope that a very significant increase in the investment that we are making on informing people could be done as quickly as possible. That may mean adjusting some of the priorities. We have ad buys from the government out there. Perhaps we can make some switches and put some of this important public health material into the advertisements right away.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666859">I am not trying to be critical because decisions are made about ad buys months ahead of time, but perhaps something could be done so that more of the questions could be answered, so that people will know what to do because they are at a high level of anxiety right now. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666878">Madam Speaker, I too appreciate the tone and the reflective nature of the member for <Affiliation DbId="128276" Type="2">Toronto—Danforth</Affiliation>'s comments. There is always a temptation to rush to over-the-top comments that give us headlines, but on an issue like this, it really is incumbent upon all of us, especially in a minority government, to work together collectively.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666879">Bear in mind the hon. member did say that where criticism is due, or where there are constructive criticisms to be made, that will happen, but to work together collectively, all of us, really is what Canadians expect from us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666880">My question is this, very briefly. The hon. member mentioned he was chair of the Toronto board of health for six years. In my background, I chaired the Hamilton public health services and social services. I wonder if he could give us a perspective on the pressures they face because the minister was suggesting that somehow they have let people down. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666881">Could he let us know what pressures are facing the local health boards?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666887">I want to begin by acknowledging the significance of this evening's discussion and thank the Speaker for recognizing the importance of having this debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666888">This is our first opportunity to question the government about some of the unfortunate developments that happened this week that caused grief and anguish among Canadians everywhere.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666889">We are not here tonight to throw stones or to cast blame. We are here tonight to get answers so that we do not repeat the same mistakes, so that we can fix the issues that have emerged, and Canadians will not have to worry and live with such fear and concern and anxiety day in and day out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666890">I remind members in the House that we are dealing with a most virulent, serious virus that can cause deep lung problems in people, leading to death. I remind everyone in the House that there have been 5,700 deaths in the world since the H1N1 virus first made its ugly appearance in our society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666891">I remind everyone in the House that we have just hit our 100th death in this country. This week alone we saw 11 deaths, young girls and boys from all parts of this country, whether we are talking about Timmins or Ottawa or Bloomingdale. Kids that were in good health and at the height of their activity were struck down. Manitoba also experienced something similar last spring when a 40-year-old man with no preconditions suddenly dropped dead from this virus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666892">We know how serious it is, and that is why we are raising questions tonight. We are prepared to give credit where credit is due, and we have done that over the many months we have been dealing with this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666893">I want to remind members that last April when the virus first emerged, we were quick to acknowledge the work of the minister in terms of briefing the opposition, in terms of having regular briefings, and in terms of keeping us informed. We will always acknowledge the government when it does something right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666894">We also, along with the government, celebrate the achievements of Dr. Frank Plummer with the National Microbiology Laboratory, who was the first scientist to decode the virus of Canadian and Mexican sources. We have much to give thanks for and we are quick to give praise where praise is due.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666895">But this week something happened. The wheels fell off the bus. Something went terribly wrong. The commitments made by the government did not prove to be worth the paper they were written on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666896">I want to remind members how often we stood in our places and asked questions about how we were prepared as a nation for a national pandemic. Each and every time we received the same line: “We are on track. Don't worry, we have enough vaccine for everybody in this country. We don't need to prioritize people. We don't need to sequence people. We don't need to single out at risk people. We don't need to worry about setting up clinics. We don't need to do any of that because, in fact, we have the vaccine and we are going to get it out as promised”. The government did not do that. Something went wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666897">The government can blame GlaxoSmithKline or it can blame the provinces or whoever, but we need to hear the government say tonight that something did go wrong. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666898">The government needs to say it is prepared to assess the situation and fix the problem, so that we can deal with people's anxieties and actually ensure that the vaccine will be forthcoming in the next week and the week after that, leading up to full coverage well before Christmas we would hope, because as everyone in the House has said, there is not much point in getting a vaccine out in December if the flu season is already over.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666899">We want the government to act as quickly as possible with a secure supply of safe vaccine. We thought that was what it was doing on October 21 when it announced that, lo and behold, it was ahead of every nation around the world and would be bringing forward 50 million doses to cover the country and no one would need to worry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666900">The government promised three million doses a week. It turned out that was a bit of an exaggeration. In fact, it was two million in the first week, maybe two million the next week, and then suddenly almost nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666901">On Friday, when the provinces were already busy setting up mass immunization clinics, spending millions of dollars in terms of hiring staff, getting the facilities in place, getting the equipment, and doing everything necessary, the government picked up the phone and said the vaccine will not be forthcoming. Sorry, no can do.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="40">(2040)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1666902">I want to know, as does the rest of the House, when did the government know there was going to be such a short supply? Why did it not tell the provinces sooner? Why was it not more forthcoming about the actual situation?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666903">Interestingly, on October 26, one week ago today, an official from GlaxoSmithKline said at committee said, “We are on track. We are on schedule in terms of producing the vaccine”. That was Monday. By Thursday, word started getting out that that was not the case. The provinces started preparing. Manitoba certainly started alerting people, much to the chagrin of the minister, whose office promptly scolded anyone for citing this as a problem. The provinces were not officially notified until Friday morning. How does one plan for something as serious and significant as a national pandemic, ensuring vaccinations of the at-risk groups and then the rest of the population, if the federal government cannot be forthcoming or even keep its word in terms of the vaccinations that are available?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666904">If there was a problem, the government should have said so. It should have told us what the problem was. Maybe it was quality control. Maybe it stopped the production in order to do the non-adjuvanted vaccine. Maybe something else happened. We do not know. Maybe the government exaggerated what it was intending to do on October 21, when it told the whole world that it was ahead of the game and that it was going to solve the problems of this national pandemic in one fell swoop.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666905">All we need from the government is for it to be honest, up front and transparent with what has happened. We know that we have to deal with this in real time. We know that we have never experienced it before. We also know that people are dying. Children are dying. Middle-aged men are dying. Pregnant women are scared out of their minds about what to do. They are getting all kinds of conflicting advice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666906">One can imagine with all of those fears going on, seeing this kind of inaction from the government and at the same time reading in the papers about private clinics getting access to the vaccine so that they can hand it out to their high-paid clients. People are buying their way to the front of the line.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666907">We raised it in the House, but the government did not have the decency to address that. It did not have the decency to stand up and say that it is also offended by that and that it will see to it that the Canada Health Act is enforced every step of the way. It did not say that it would not allow our precious H1N1 vaccine to go out to the highest bidders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666908">This is about ensuring that the people who need it get it first and that it is distributed and dealt with on a public, not-for-profit basis. There is no room anywhere in our health care system for that kind of privatization. There is certainly no room in a time of crisis for a government to allow this to happen and then to say nothing about it. There is no room for it to not come clean and at least say that it should have set out guidelines, that there should be national standards and that it failed on that front.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666909">Today, all we are asking is that the government look at the problems that happened and sort them out so that over the next few weeks, the provinces and the people of this country can be guaranteed the vaccine as they line up and wait for it. We ask that it follow the advice of my leader and start to look at cost sharing some of the expenses around this and not just 60% of the vaccine, where it ended up not keeping its end of the bargain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666910">We ask that it start to pay for some of the additional costs that every province has to bear and first nations communities have to undertake, anywhere extra costs come with the pandemic. We ask that it come to the table and be prepared to cooperate and show that we can solve this problem together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666911">We are not here to create fear or to scare people. We are here to say that there is concern and anxiety out there which the government has a responsibility to address. That is exactly what we expect from the government tonight during this emergency debate.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666912">Madam Speaker, I listened intently to some of the comments the member opposite made. At one point she said that our government promised to solve this problem in one fell swoop.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666913">I have been in the chamber many times during question period when our <Affiliation DbId="128707" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> has been very clear that Canadians could expect the rollout of this vaccine in the first week of November. In fact, we were earlier than that. The other thing that I think Canadians need to be reminded of is that Canada has more vaccine available per capita than any other country in the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666914">Granted, there are many more to be vaccinated, but does the member honestly feel that it would be possible to vaccinate 33 million Canadians in the first week of the rollout of this campaign?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1666915">Madam Speaker, that is a very good question, because when we asked the minister in the House way back in the middle of September when we came back from the summer recess what was the plan in terms of setting priorities for at-risk groups, the minister and the Public Health Agency officials said, “Do not worry. We do not have to have a priority list. We do not have to sequence, because we have 50 million doses ready to cover this country”. We knew it would take time to roll out, and that is why we asked for leadership from the government to identify those groups, just as President Obama did in the dead of summer, just as the Manitoba government and other provincial governments did early in September. They did not wait for the federal government to finally come forward on September 16 with its list of priorities, leaving the provinces to sort it out themselves and resulting in no national strategy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666916">When the problem hit and people were coming in droves to get vaccinated because of fear, worry and anxiety, the government could not produce what it had promised. We are not talking about 50 million doses. We are talking about three million doses a week, as it promised, and the government could not keep its word. That is where the problem lies. The government cannot set up demand and expectations and then fall down on its end of the bargain. The government has to be faithful and true in terms of its commitment and keep its word.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666918">Could the member comment on why the government ordered the vaccine so late in the year? It ordered the pandemic vaccine in August. That was after other countries had ordered it. Then the government gambled on the date of when the second wave might hit. It was preparing for November. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666919">What if this had happened earlier, as in the past? What if it had hit in September and October? What would the government have done to protect the health of Canadians in that gap period?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666920">The importance of having a pandemic plan is to update it as required. Why did the government choose to use only one company and only one production line?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1666921">Madam Speaker, those are excellent questions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666922">With respect to the tardiness of the government in placing its order, that is one of the questions of the hour. We know that Treasury Board's decision was not made until the end of July. An order was placed on August 6. That was weeks and weeks after the problem had been identified, and after the health committee had held emergency meetings in the summer, and of course the Conservatives suggested that we were just playing politics, to push them in terms of getting prepared, and that was the result. That is a question that has to be addressed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666923">Also, a big problem has emerged by the government not following its own advice to ensure there are at least two suppliers of a flu vaccine. That is the policy in place for every other flu vaccine. When it comes to H1N1 vaccine, the government decided that it could go to one company. An expert witness at the health committee showed just how much of a problem that is. Dr. Rob Van Exan from Sanofi Pasteur came to our committee and said that in a normal regular flu season, which predates GSK's involvement in this, there were always at least two companies that were given the contract. Producing a vaccine is difficult. There could be quality control problems, and there is a need for a backup supply. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666924">For some reason the government decided to go with one supplier only. On top of that, the government gave the supplier an additional contract beyond whatever the company signed eight years ago to allow it to switch production in order to make the non-adjuvanted vaccine.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1666925">Madam Speaker, I rise in the House tonight to address Canada's overall plan for preparedness with respect to the H1N1 virus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666926">Canadians remember all too well the 2003 outbreak of SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome. It killed 44 Canadians, made hundreds more sick and paralyzed a major segment of our health care system for weeks. More than 25,000 residents of the Toronto area were placed in quarantine, myself included. The economic effects reverberated across the entire country. The SARS experience brought to a head growing concerns about the capacity of Canada's public health system to anticipate and respond effectively to public health threats.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666927">In May 2003, the former minister of health appointed Dr. David Naylor, then dean of the University of Toronto's school of medicine, to chair a national advisory committee on SARS and public health to look at ways to improve Canada's public health system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666928">The committee on SARS and public health was established in early May 2003. The committee's mandate was to provide a third party assessment of current public health efforts and lessons learned for ongoing and future infectious disease control. Committee members represented disciplines and perspectives from across Canada. Several were directly involved in responding to SARS in different capacities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666929"> The committee reviewed source documents, conducted interviews and engaged consultants to undertake surveys, additional interviews and analyses to illuminate aspects of the SARS experience. Advice was also sought from a constitutional legal expert. Over 30 non-governmental and voluntary sector stakeholders submitted helpful briefs and letters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666930">The Naylor report said that dealing successfully with future public health crises would require a truly collaborative framework involving different levels of government with a shared commitment to protecting and promoting the health of all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666931">As Dr. Naylor said, Canada's ability to contain an outbreak is only as strong as the weakest judicial jurisdiction in the chain of provincial and territorial public health systems. He said that infectious diseases cannot be addressed in isolation by any one public health entity. All levels of the public health system needed to be reinforced and their components more fully integrated with each other.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666932">Pre-SARS there were no federal transfers earmarked for local and PT public health activities. Public health competed against personal health services for health dollars in provincial budgets, even as the federal government increasingly earmarked its health transfers for personal health services priorities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666933">The SARS story, as it unfolded in Canada, had both tragic and heroic elements. Although the toll of the epidemic was substantial, thousands in the health field rose to the occasion and ultimately contained the SARS outbreak in this country. It was no small feat. For that, their efforts should be applauded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666934">Following Dr. Naylor's report, a new federal approach to Canada's public health system took shape based on three pillars: first, creating a chief public health officer, CPHO, for Canada; second, building a pan-Canadian public health network; and third, building a federal public health agency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666935">In 2004, the Public Health Agency of Canada, PHAC, was created and the Public Health Agency of Canada Act was passed in April 2006.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666936">As the main federal agency responsible for public health, PHAC supports about 2,400 researchers and staff, as well as a wide variety of programs and services offered by both the federal government and non-governmental agencies, NGOs, across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666937">Long before the conception of PHAC, the federal government was working closely with the World Health Organization and other public health bodies to focus on initiatives to strengthen pandemic influenza preparedness, consisting of five program components. The position of the World Health Organization, WHO, with regard to a pandemic has always been that it is a question of when, not if.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666938">The WHO worked with member countries to produce a global agenda for influenza surveillance and control to prepare for the next influenza pandemic and to coordinate international action in influenza surveillance and control.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="55">(2055)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1666939">The WHO urged all countries to develop or update their own plans for dealing with influenza. In keeping with the WHO global agenda, the federal-provincial-territorial governments in Canada established a pandemic influenza committee that produced the Canadian pandemic influenza plan, CPIP. Among other things, the plan provided a framework to guide the actions of all levels of government for prevention, preparedness and response implementation activities. Provinces and territories used the plan as a framework for developing their own plans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666940"> In addition, in keeping with the plan, we took a number of important steps to strengthen its pandemic readiness. We increased surveillance and monitoring of influenza outbreaks to detect cases and clusters of severe or emerging respiratory infections and to effectively prevent and contain their spread.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666941">Also, national case definitions and standardized laboratory tests and protocols were developed to ensure consistent approaches to diagnosing, managing and reporting cases of severe respiratory infection. An influenza pandemic vaccine contract was put in place to enhance capacity to produce enough doses to meet domestic supply needs based on one dose per person in the event of a pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666942">A pandemic influenza preparedness strategy aimed at further strengthening Canada's pandemic influenza readiness was recommended. Building on activities identified in the CPIP and outstanding issues, the proposed strategy included: first, development and testing of a mock, for example a prototype vaccine, using the H5N1 virus to test domestic production capacity and enhance regulatory readiness to reduce the time later required to prove a pandemic vaccine; second, federal contribution toward the initial establishment of a national stockpile of antiviral medications; third, new research and development measures to improve Canada's influenza research capacity and to develop rapid vaccine technology for emerging influenza viruses; fourth, emergency preparedness and response measures to improve federal-provincial-territorial capacity to respond to an influenza pandemic through health and social service planning, testing of the CPIP and development of national standards for emergency social service, psychological, social service delivery; and fifth, communications and collaboration activities to engage stakeholders in the development of a national risk communications approach and to strengthen international collaboration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666943">Budget 2006 provided $1 billion over five years, years 2006 to 2011, to implement this preparedness strategy to respond to the threat of pandemic influenza, including a pandemic contingency fund. This money sought to strengthen federal capacity in seven major areas: vaccines and antivirals, surge capacity, prevention and early warning, emergency preparedness, critical science and regulation, risk communications and federal-provincial-territorial and international collaboration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666944">PHAC received $384 million over five years to strengthen federal human health capacity to prepare and respond to the threat of avian and pandemic influenza in several areas including: rapid vaccine development capacity and the purchase of antiviral drugs; support to on-reserve first nations communities in the development, testing and revisions of community level influenza pandemic plans; risk communications strategies, including social marketing campaigns; field surge capacity such as the deployment of field epidemiologists and laboratory experts to affected countries and quarantine officers to points of entry; establishment of the national veterinary reserve and Canadian avian influenza vaccine bank; and early warning surveillance in collaboration with the WHO.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666945">In addition, Health Canada received $15.5 million to address the needs of first nations communities with respect to public health emergency planning and for regulatory work, including review readiness and safety monitoring for vaccines and resources for review and approval of antiviral drug submissions for the treatment of pandemic influenza.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666946">The Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the CIHR, also received funding of $21.5 million. This continues to support over 140 pandemic and influenza-related projects that contribute to managing the current influenza outbreak. CIHR continues to examine this research in contribution to the understanding of the H1N1 flu virus and better management of this outbreak.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666947">This funding was a significant investment that showed foresight, leadership and commitment to the health and well-being of all Canadians. It is because of this investment that Canada has been on the leading edge of the global response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666948">In fact, other countries have commented on how well Canada has been responding, including Dr. Margaret Chan, head of the WHO, who specifically commended Canada for all its efforts. I think Canadians would agree that we are well prepared on each and every level.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666949">In May of this year the health portfolio accessed the 2009-10 contingency fund to support first and second wave activities. The health portfolio used the 2009-10 contingency funding to respond to urgent H1N1 pressures on PHAC, Health Canada and the CFIA and to initiate second wave planning. Thanks to these efforts, Canada is a global leader in pandemic planning and we are implementing the Canadian pandemic influenza plan to reduce the effects of a possible pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666950">The pandemic plan is the product of an extensive dialogue and collaboration with provincial and territorial public health authorities, health care workers, scientific exports and academics. It is only through this foresight and advanced planning that the health portfolio has been in a position to respond as quickly and effectively as it has to the H1N1 virus.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666960">Mr. Speaker, as we know, this issue is a non-partisan issue. When we are dealing with human lives, we should stick with issues that matter to Canadians. Therefore, it is for this reason that I react poorly to the government blaming the provinces and the vaccine manufacturers for the issue Canadians are facing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666962">The health authorities around the world saw this pandemic coming when it first hit in April. While many countries ordered their vaccine in May, the Conservatives waited until early August. The World Health Organization recommended production of H1N1 vaccine on July 7, but the Conservative government waited until after August 6 to place its vaccine order with GlaxoSmithKline, delaying vaccinations for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666963">When we look at other countries, other countries placed their vaccine orders much earlier than Canada. China began mass vaccination by administering the first H1N1 flu shots on September, Australia on September 30, the United States on October 3, Sweden on October 12, Japan on October 19 and Britain on October 21. Canada did not start administering the H1N1 vaccine until October 26.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1666966">I was in Washington a couple of weeks ago, attending a convention. Some of the top doctors from Tunisia, France, the United States, Australia, New Zealand and all over the world were there. Two things they complimented us on were the handling of the H1N1 pandemic issue in Canada and our economic action plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666967">The member stood and said some things that he claimed to be facts, but he is simply wrong. I do not know how to explain it any better than that. We have not blamed anyone. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666968">In fact, he talked about us ordering in August. Back in 2001, under his government, an agreement was made with GlaxoSmithKline to provide vaccines in an event of a pandemic. When we ordered, we ensured that we would have enough vaccine for each and every Canadian who wanted it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666969">To be specific, as of today, six million doses of the H1N1 vaccine have been delivered to the provinces and the territories.

When and where did these cases start and spread? An investigation needs to be undertaken as to why aboriginal cases were not picked up, or if they were, why they were not reported and acted upon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666997">What federal officials went to northern Manitoba as Canadian scientists went to Mexico? Where was the compassion and the urgency to see first-hand the devastation, the lack of supplies and infrastructure, and most important, what was needed to perhaps slow down the spread of the virus and guarantee prompt treatment of very sick individuals?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666998">Why was there a lack of federal action during the spring wave in aboriginal communities? Why were aggressive containment measures not attempted? The WHO has since said these measures can slow the spread. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1666999">What was done to ensure the administration of antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu in a timely manner? Antiviral drugs, when used for treatment, can make someone feel better or shorten the time a person is sick by one or two days. They can also prevent serious flu complications. Dr. Anand Kumar, an emergency doctor from Winnipeg, explained to our parliamentary health committee that some people had to wait seven or eight days for treatment and that this likely impacted patient outcome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667000">Aboriginal people account for only 4% of the Canadian population. Why were 17.5% of those who were hospitalized aboriginal, 15% who stayed in ICU aboriginal, and 12% of deaths aboriginal? As of October 7, why were 38% of confirmed H1N1 cases first nations or Métis persons living off-reserve? A real investigation is needed so that these sad and sobering statistics are not repeated. </ParaText>

As such, my colleague from the riding of St. Paul's and I travelled to aboriginal communities to see first-hand the state of pandemic preparedness and we wrote a letter to the minister asking for answers to our questions. My colleague asked that the health committee be called back in August, because the House had recessed June 18 and would not sit again until September 14. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667003">One chief reported that, of 30 communities in northern Manitoba, two had a pandemic plan and none had been tested.

However, members of the parliamentary health committee learned that the government would stay the course regarding H1N1.

              <ParaText id="1667014">How many Canadians have been vaccinated? What percentage of the population do they represent? What is the government's contingency plan for the gap period? That is the time between the second wave hitting and when people can get vaccinated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667015">Communication is vital in responding to any crisis, and clear, consistent messages are required. Our offices have been inundated by health care workers and the public who want real answers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667016">Perhaps the greatest confusion has surrounded vaccine for pregnant women. The World Health Organization advisory panel on vaccines recommended in June that non-adjuvanted vaccine be used for pregnant women if it were available. However, the Conservative government ordered adjuvanted vaccine in early August and later ordered non-adjuvanted vaccine. Why were pregnant women an afterthought?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667017">When the WHO made its recommendation in June, there was no safety data for the adjuvanted vaccine in pregnant women, and expectant women fared poorly during past pandemics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667018">The government then recommended that pregnant women wait for the non-adjuvanted vaccine unless the cases of H1N1 were rising in their area. If the woman was over 20 weeks, she should take the adjuvanted vaccine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667019">To add to the confusion, the government then ordered 200,000 doses from Australia. We recognize that the position has now been made clear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667020">Regarding the adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccines, we must ask: Who made the decision to halt the production of the adjuvanted vaccine? On what date was the decision made and the provinces and territories told? On what date did the minister know the delivery date would be delayed, and when did the minister inform the provinces and territories and the Canadian people?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667021">Since the spring we have asked over 200 questions of the government regarding pandemic preparedness. We wanted to ensure that the government was prepared for a possible second wave. We are now in full response mode and we need bold action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667022">We need the $400 million from the 2006 budget redeployed to pandemic response. We need additional resources for the provinces and territories. We need clear, consistent messages for public health and Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1667031">The government pretended to have a handle on this whole issue. It kept saying it was going to start the vaccination program on November 1 and it had 50 million doses. Then all of a sudden, very quickly, we see the government accelerated the program. It started a week ahead.</ParaText>

While the government is promoting the idea that six million doses have been given out, it is not the number of doses that have been distributed that matters; it is the number of doses of vaccine that have gotten into the arms of Canadians.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1667040">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to take part in this emergency debate on the A (H1N1) virus. I asked to take part in it because I have spent my whole life, whether as a general practitioner or as a politician—mayor or member of Parliament—trying to understand people and disease, but particularly listening, diagnosing and then supporting my patients through their ordeals, whatever these may have been. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667041">Health is the single most important thing for each and every one of our fellow citizens, and we must, to the extent possible, try to maintain our health, including through prevention. Prevention can be a very personal matter such as eating a healthy diet or being a non-smoker. However, prevention is also a government's responsibility, as is the case with the current A (H1N1) pandemic, regarding which the Conservative government has failed miserably in its prevention approach. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667042">Let us not forget that we are now going through the second phase of this pandemic, with the first phase having begun in Mexico, last spring. So, the Conservative government was aware of the issue and had plenty of time to prepare for it, but showed no leadership in this regard. The other countries have been preparing for a long time to fight this pandemic, but what has the Conservative government done?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667043">Health authorities all over the world saw this pandemic coming when the virus hit, back in April. And while many countries were busy ordering vaccines in May, the Conservatives waited until early August.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667044">The World Health Organization, the WHO, recommended the production of H1N1 flu vaccines on July 7, but the Conservative government waited until August 6, a month later, to order vaccines from GlaxoSmithKline. That unbelievable delay is largely responsible for the current shortage of vaccines. The WHO also recommended non-adjuvanted vaccines for pregnant women on July 7, but again the Conservatives waited and did not order those vaccines until September 4. Why did it wait for close to two months before making a decision? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667045">The federal government's slowness in following up on the WHO recommendations resulted in the production of adjuvanted vaccines being slowed down this week, because of new priorities in the production. This is why fewer vaccines have been delivered to Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667046"> A number of other countries placed their orders for vaccine much earlier than Canada. The United States and the United Kingdom placed their first orders in May. Yes, I said in May. By July 24, Novartis International had already received orders for the H1N1 vaccine and was holding discussions with more than 35 governments. It had even signed contracts with the United States, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland. The Americans alone ordered more than $1 billion worth of H1N1 vaccine and it was delivered well before the vaccine was made available in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667047"> Take China for example. It started its mass vaccination campaign by administering its first H1N1 vaccines on September 21. Australia did so on September 30, the United States on October 5, Sweden on October 12, Japan on October 19, and Great Britain on October 21. Canada, on the other hand, did not start vaccinations until October 26.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667048"> A government that felt responsible for the health and safety of its citizens would have acted back in May. A responsible government would have taken the lead on this by conducting a public education campaign at all levels. Did this Conservative government promote the vaccine, explain the gravity of the illness to Canadians, and tell them as well that in order for the vaccine to be really effective and substantially reduce the number of people who fall sick, as many people as possible have to be vaccinated? The answer is no. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667049"> The harmful effects of this virus should be explained to Canadians through the electronic media, newspapers, schools, the universities and even religious institutions. People have a right to know. Five medical doctors in the Liberal caucus issued a press release on this and have been constantly asking the government questions about it, but are still without an answer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667050"> South of the border, the Obama administration has proclaimed a national health emergency and given U.S. health authorities additional powers to deal with the pandemic and contain it. Instead of informing Canadians about the possibly very serious effects of the virus, the Conservative government preferred to spend $60 million announcing infrastructure projects and providing tax information. It puts concrete before health. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="35">(2135)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1667051"> Things have been in total chaos for weeks, if not months. It has been left to the media to invite experts to give the public information. There has been complete silence from this government, other than meaningless and unworthy answers to questions asked by opposition members. A sample answer: “Canada has the best per capita vaccination rate.” I am sorry, but that is the lowest common denominator. We are not talking about “per capita”, we are talking about men, women and children who are all worried.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667052"> It is because of the inaction of this government, which has not been able to explain what this flu strain is. Why get vaccinated? Is the vaccine safe? Should pregnant women be vaccinated? Should children be vaccinated? Because of their inaction in the face of this crisis, panic started to emerge after the unfortunate death of a young boy in Ontario and the proportion of people wanting to get vaccinated rose from 30% to 80% in a few days. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667053"> The Liberal Party of Canada implores the Conservative government to use part of the $400 million set aside in the 2006 budget for intervention in the case of a pandemic. Yes, we are in a pandemic situation now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667054"> The entire population should be vaccinated, but while we wait we have to tell the Canadian public, over and over, that one of the best ways to protect yourself against this illness is always a simple thing to do: whenever possible, wash your hands as often as possible with soap and water or a substitute product.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667055"> I could continue, but in conclusion, I implore this government to give health priority over concrete.</ParaText>

We will have to reprint the guide again after distributing more than 650,000 copies to 6,500 Canadian post offices in two weeks alone. We will not have enough guides and we released them just two weeks ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667078">We have also launched massive media campaigns. The Public Health Agency of Canada is broadcasting a message to all Canadians. This week, that message was heard on 238 radio stations. Health Canada is broadcasting messages to first nations and Inuit people through 80 radio stations in addition to public service announcements on northern community stations. The department has also published messages targeted to these people in 43 community newspapers and placed advertising banners on first nations and Inuit websites. Between October 19 and October 30, we mailed a brochure to more than 10 million Canadian households, to tell families how to identify the H1N1 virus and where to find additional information. </ParaText>

The Government of Canada is responding to that demand by providing timely, factual and relevant information on the virus. The degree of awareness about H1N1 in Canada is now extremely high, particularly considering that six months ago no one had heard of the H1N1 virus or the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667080">We are finding out that people are making decisions regarding their health and are assessing the choices available to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667081">The information campaigns, the public announcements, the numerous interviews given by the <Affiliation DbId="128707" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> and by Dr. Butler-Jones, and the press conferences we are holding several times a week are all initiatives which show clearly that we are providing Canadians with a great deal of quality information. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667082">Here is another example. On Tuesday, after vaccination centres opened across the country, we noticed a threefold increase in the number of people visiting the Public Health Agency of Canada's FightFlu.ca website. Until then, the all-time record was 60,000 hits. On that Tuesday, 196,000 people visited the site, or 22,000 people per hour. Canadians know about the FightFlu.ca website, and they visit it in large numbers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667083">They look at an average of three pages each time, which is very good. They spend more time on these pages, which means that they are actually reading the content and that they go further to get information. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667084">It is also easy to see that they are showing up at vaccination centres. They want to get vaccinated. Three weeks ago, few people wanted to get the vaccine. We are working with all our partners to ensure that Canadians will indeed get vaccinated.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1667085">Our efforts are paying off, and because everyone has worked together so closely, we are ready for whatever winter brings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667086">When the epidemic began, we distributed more than four million health alert notices to travellers in Canadian airports, in cooperation with Transport Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667087">In late April, we started running infection prevention messages in 24 international airports in Canada, in cooperation with the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667088">In May, we distributed posters to 49 airports showing how to prevent infection by using proper hand washing technique and coughing into one's sleeve, for example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667089">We have also signed an agreement with the Weather Network, which is using information from the Public Health Agency's FluWatch site on its website and its television stations in French and English. The Weather Network is also broadcasting general infection prevention messages on behalf of PHAC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667090">The volume of targeted, factual, complete information we are providing to Canadians and the variety of methods we are using to do so are quite simply unprecedented in Canadian history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667091">I could also remind this House that the national communication strategy is a multi-tiered strategy. The federal government is not alone in providing Canadians with information. We are working in partnership with the provinces and territories and local authorities.</ParaText>

So in mid-November, there will be many children who will be in line for a booster, but we do not know what the rules are. Will there be a vaccine available and should children be getting a booster?

              <ParaText id="1667107"> Mr. Speaker, perhaps someone could ask me that excellent question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667108">I stand behind this government's solid approach to managing this H1N1 outbreak and to our comprehensive, forward-looking pandemic plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667109">Tonight, I will focus my remarks on vaccine timing and availability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667110">I can think of no more eloquent a response for those who have expressed doubt to our capacity to manage the outbreak and to note the facts. To date, six million doses of adjuvanted H1N1 flu vaccine have been delivered to the provinces and territories. That is currently more H1N1 flu vaccine per capita than any other country in the world, more than the United States, Great Britain, Australia, France, Germany, Japan, or anywhere else.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667111">More to the point, we have ordered enough H1N1 flu vaccine for every Canadian from coast to coast to coast who needs and wants to be immunized. No one will be left behind. And, yes, that H1N1 flu vaccine, a safe and effective vaccine, will be available to Canadians in a timely way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667112">We have not cut corners on safety in order to rush product to Canadians. We have acted in a responsible and deliberate way that balances the need to ensure a safe and effective vaccine is available and the need to stay ahead of the outbreak. That is a tough balancing act, but I believe we have the balance right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667113">Last week witnessed the beginning of the largest mass immunization campaign in Canadian history. That campaign, slated to start in early November, actually began ahead of schedule, on October 26.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667114"> We moved more quickly because our early warning systems told us the nature and pace of the second wave of the outbreak had changed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667115"> We moved more quickly because we could draw on the knowledge, expertise and experience of an extensive global network of regulatory agencies and public health experts to assess H1N1 flu vaccine safety and the effectiveness across different populations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667116"> We moved more quickly because our regulator and our vaccine manufacturer had worked closely together to define both the expectations and the process to be followed to approve a vaccine for a novel influence of flu virus, but in advance of this outbreak so we can move more quickly if the situation required this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667117">We moved more quickly because the context had changed and the health and safety of Canadians was at risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667118">Because we knew it would be impossible to vaccinate everyone at one time, the Government of Canada in co-operation with the provinces and territories jointly determined sequencing guidelines for the distribution of H1N1 flu vaccine. This was done to ensure that vaccine programs could target priority groups first, allowing those who need the vaccine most to get it first.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667119">As per the agreed upon guidance, these priority groups are: people under the age 65 with chronic conditions; pregnant women; children six months to less than five years of age; people living in remote and isolated settings or communities; health care workers involved in pandemic response or the delivery of essential health care services; and household contacts and care providers of persons at high risk who cannot be immunized or may not respond to vaccines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667120">I want to assure members that the Government of Canada, along with the provinces and territories, has been working diligently to distribute and administer the H1N1 flu vaccine as quickly, safely and broadly as we possibly can.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667121">The Government of Canada provides important technical information, guidance and the real time support provinces and territories need to make informed decisions about when, how and to whom to administer the H1N1 vaccine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667122">Provinces and territories, which have the lead responsibility for administering the vaccine, rely on this extraordinary partnership to make clear and consistent information available to health professionals and ordinary citizens. We are moving forward together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667123">Canada's vaccine supplier, GSK, has informed us that the vaccine supply being shipped across Canada will be lower next week. In order to meet our request to produce a supply of unadjuvanted vaccine for pregnant women, the company had to switch over its vaccine production fill line.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="00">(2200)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1667124">Without getting overly technical, the formulation for unadjuvanted vaccine differs slightly from that for adjuvanted vaccine and the vial size is also different.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667125">Switching production from one vaccine to another and then re-calibrating fill-lines and retesting output for quality takes about three to four days. That resulted in reduced vaccine availability for November 2. However, normal vaccine production has already resumed and our output should return to normal by next week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667126">As some who is not a member of a high risk group, it is without hesitation I would prefer to wait a few extra weeks to ensure that pregnant women are protected. It is also important to note that every batch of vaccine is quality tested before it is shipped to the provinces and territories. Lots that do not meet the quality standards are not released, which can have an impact on the weekly number of doses distributed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667127">The Government of Canada has been in constant touch with GSK and the provinces and territories and is sharing information with the provinces and territories on each week's supply of vaccine as soon as it is available.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667128">There has been constant communication both at the working level and at the senior management level to share information on both availability and possible delays. We are working together with one goal in mind, to protect the health and safety of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667129">Indeed, by the end of last week, six million doses of vaccine had been delivered. That is more vaccine per capita than any other country in the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667130">I want to express my gratitude and appreciation for the many health care workers working at clinics. These are very challenging and unique circumstances they are working under. Jurisdictions are giving more vaccine per day than they have ever given in history. I am very pleased to see many thousands of Canadians on the priority list getting their vaccines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667131">It is important to take a global perspective. Diseases do not respect borders. This is a worldwide pandemic. Many countries around the world are beginning their vaccine campaigns and each are facing different challenges in getting their populations vaccinated. However, it is important to remember that Canada is in the very fortunate position and we remain hopeful to have every Canadian who needs and wants to be vaccinated by Christmas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667132">Scientific studies show that the vaccine is safe and effective. We know that from clinical trials conducted in several countries around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667133">The H1N1 flu vaccine is produced in a similar manner to seasonal flu vaccines, which have been used safety and effectively in Canada for many years. The vaccine contains an adjuvant, which is an ingredient made of naturally occurring oil, water and vitamin E that boosts the body's immune response and increases the vaccine effectiveness. The same adjuvant was tested in 45,000 people and did not identify any safety concerns for healthy adults or children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667134">Now that immunization has begun, the Public Health Agency of Canada will work with provinces and territories to produce weekly reports of all reported adverse events associated with the H1N1 vaccine. This reporting will be done through the existing system, the Canadian Adverse Events Following Immunization Surveillance System. This system is supported by health care professionals who report adverse events to their provincial-territorial public health offices, which share the information with the agency. This existing system will be supported by additional projects that will provide more detailed data specifically about the H1N1 flu vaccine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667135">The Government of Canada will continue to work with its provincial and territorial partners to ensure that all Canadians have the information they need to make informed decisions about immunization. Most important, we have stayed on message to get the vaccine. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667136">Unlike in the era of our grandparents, we are truly fortunate to live in a time when we have a capacity to mount a quick and robust response to emerging viruses.</ParaText>

No one can predict the rate of severe disease, but some experts say it is one in one thousand cases, which could translate to 1,500 to 2,500 ICU cases simultaneously across the country.

              <ParaText id="1667147">Mr. Speaker, when looking at this, we have to remember that we currently have a global crisis. Countries across the world are ordering vaccines for their populations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667148">In Canada what we have to be thankful for is that right now we have more vaccines per capita than any other country. Also, we are going to have enough vaccine to vaccinate every single person in our population who chooses to be vaccinated. In Canada we need to feel fortunate about those facts.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1667149">Mr. Speaker, I am very glad to have the opportunity this evening to talk about the H1N1 issue and the urgency surrounding it. As a member of the Standing Committee on Health, as I just said, I have come to understand the tremendous breadth of the H1N1 problem over the past few months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667150">I have to say that I was extremely surprised by the government's amateur—yes, amateur—handling of the H1N1 crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667151">Earlier, I asked my colleague a question about companies. In 2006, the government signed an exclusive contract with GSK to distribute vaccines. As the member for <Affiliation DbId="128273" Type="2">Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine</Affiliation> said, six companies were capable of supplying the vaccine. Therein lies the problem. We knew we were headed for a pandemic. The government was warned months ago, nearly a year ago. We agree that the H1N1 pandemic began sometime in December 2008 or January 2009. The government was therefore well aware of the issue and could see the problem coming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667152">In my opinion, the federal government is to blame for the long lineups of people waiting to get the H1N1 vaccine, because of its poor organization and lack of preparation. We went through the SARS crisis, which gave us some idea of what to expect. The federal government should have learned something from the SARS crisis and come up with some improvements regarding this situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667153">The problem is that the Conservative government did absolutely nothing. It could have taken action a long time ago. On January 11, 2009, the WHO declared a phase 6 pandemic for H1N1. The Government of Canada waited until August 2009 to order 50 million doses of the adjuvanted vaccine and until September 2009 to order the non-adjuvanted vaccine for pregnant women. That is extremely worrisome. I mentioned the month of August 2009 for 50 million doses of the adjuvanted vaccine. Since that time, the government has known that the adjuvanted doses could not be given to pregnant women, and this was repeated many times in committee. We heard from witnesses and doctors who knew it posed a problem, but the Conservative government never got the message. Suddenly, about a week and a half ago, it finally realized there was a problem and that there would not be enough non-adjuvanted doses for pregnant women, who are one of the of high-risk groups for H1N1. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667154">This government's mismanagement does not end with the H1N1 flu. Unfortunately, it extends to a number of other files, so much so that sometimes I miss the Liberals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667155">About a week and a half ago, the government purchased almost 200,000 doses from Australia even though our pharmaceutical companies were ready to manufacture the vaccine. The government did not want to do business with them, which I find very troublesome for another reason.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667156">My colleagues may find it ironic coming from a Bloc member, but I think this is unfortunate for Canada's pharmaceutical industry in general. We have some very good pharmaceutical companies, in Quebec as well. I am thinking primarily of the very good companies located on Montreal's West Island, as well as in the rest of Canada, in Toronto, for example. They could have started up production and supplied the vaccine. Unfortunately, the government did not want to do business with them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667157">The government did not act prudently. Rather than ordering the vaccine from a number of pharmaceutical laboratories, in order to ensure a steady stream of deliveries, the government relied solely on GSK. It then blamed the company for overestimating its production capacity. You do not take such risks with people's health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667158">At present, the Government of Quebec has a lack of resources to deal with H1N1.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="10">(2210)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1667159">The shortage of vaccine doses has sparked a wave of panic among citizens. With all the horror stories circulating about the swine flu, I can understand why people flocked to the vaccination clinics when the first doses became available. In some areas, there was an odd dynamic because people were being urged to get the vaccine but the polls showed that they did not necessarily want to be vaccinated. We ended up with the problem of having everyone wanting to be vaccinated because of the disastrous scenarios circulating. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667160">People have shown up in droves to be vaccinated, even those not in the high risk categories but who had concerns about H1N1. That is understandable given the confusing announcements about the Conservatives' plans and their amateurism in telling us that all was well but that there were some problems. We were never given the right information by the Conservatives. And that is also the case for a good number of other files.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667161">Without accurate information, citizens have decided out of fear to go en masse to be vaccinated. We now have the problem of not having enough doses of vaccine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667162">What is more, according to the Canadian Press, money is available to provide the provinces with additional funds to cope with this urgent situation. The government did not hesitate to write big cheques with the Conservative Party logo on them, but it is slow to open the coffers to help the provinces to deal with this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667163">I will admit that I have a great deal of difficulty with the Conservatives telling us that we in the opposition are engaging in demagoguery with H1N1, that we are playing politics with H1N1, and the public is not fooled either. It knows full well that when the Conservatives advance that type of regressive argument that adds nothing to the debate, they are only hurting themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667164">The federal government, as I was saying, is largely responsible for all this. The Bloc Québécois feels that the federal government is largely responsible for the H1N1 vaccination campaign. By taking this crisis so lightly, the government has caused panic in the public, who feel caught off guard and completely misinformed. The government's lack of organization just confirms the concerns the Bloc Québécois has had from the start about the possibility of the vaccine not arriving on time to avoid the second wave of the H1N1 influenza pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667165">I was saying earlier, being a member of the Standing Committee on Health, that we have been talking about this since August. Since August we, together with the Liberals and the NDP, have been expressing our fears and pointing out the problem and we have done exemplary work. I am thinking about the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128654" Type="2">Verchères—Les Patriotes</Affiliation>, who did a fantastic job of asking the government for answers and asking witnesses to provide arguments to show that the Conservatives had not been doing their job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667166">The government's lack of organization just confirms our concerns. The World Health Organization had been warning authorities for quite some time about a global outbreak of the pandemic. The concerns about this possibility were raised as soon as the virus appeared in early spring 2009. What is more, the WHO declared this a pandemic in June 2009.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667167">The federal government could have planned ahead for the production of non adjuvanted vaccine for pregnant women, who are the most vulnerable to H1N1, knowing that there was no clinical test for that group and thereby prevented an inexcusable delay in the production of the regular vaccine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667168">I have a hard time understanding how Europe approved the vaccine weeks ago, yet our government had not yet approved it. If memory serves me right, it was not approved until last Wednesday. The member for <Affiliation DbId="128654" Type="2">Verchères—Les Patriotes</Affiliation> could tell me. Yes, it was last Wednesday.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="15">(2215)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1667169">Europe had already approved it weeks earlier, and the Conservatives did so only last week. The Public Health Agency of Canada has had to deal with droves of people, and the government approved it last week, based on the European studies. Why did the government not encourage the agency to approve it earlier? In the end, they used the same European studies, but they waited, and that delay cost us very valuable days for producing the vaccine. When we are talking about fighting a worldwide flu pandemic, like the H1N1 pandemic, every day counts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667170">The federal government should have planned ahead for the production. Although Canadian public health officials have confirmed that they had not anticipated such a rush from the public to get the H1N1 vaccine, they should have planned to order doses based on the total population, and not on the number of people who expressed an interest, since at the beginning of the crisis, the government thought that several doses would be needed for each person. This is a matter of public safety. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667171">In fact, at the start of the information campaign, the government ordered 50.4 million doses from GSK, enough for everyone in Canada to receive an initial dose. All the governments of Quebec and the provinces are asking the federal government is to provide them with enough doses for their population. But this is something the federal government cannot seem to do properly, judging by the latest news about delays in the distribution of the vaccine. The Conservatives can say that all Canadians who want the vaccine will be able to receive it, but it remains to be seen whether they can protect themselves before it is too late. It is estimated that, with luck, everyone who wants to be vaccinated will be by Christmas, which still gives the virus plenty of time to spread.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667172">As I said earlier, this debate is useless. It provides an opportunity to show how the federal government has failed. The government has a responsibility to release additional funds so that Quebec and the provinces can hire more nurses to vaccinate people when the vaccine arrives. These funds could also be used to improve information sharing on the vaccination campaign. So far, the federal government has been sending mixed messages to the public, and people are becoming more and more confused.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667173">I would like to summarize the situation. The WHO advised health authorities on June 11, 2009 that the world was at the start of a phase 6 influenza pandemic. Canada announced that it was ordering 50.4 million doses from GSK on August 6. As I said earlier, every day is important in the fight against a pandemic. There is evidence that the government wasted valuable time for no reason. The federal government ordered 1.2 million doses of unadjuvanted vaccine for pregnant women on September 6, 2009. I feel that this brief chronology is very important, because it shows how the Conservative government has failed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667174">When a pandemic as serious as this one is developing, the government should not waste precious weeks waiting and twiddling its thumbs. I am not questioning the quality of the work done by the nurses at the Public Health Agency of Canada and all of Canada's health officials. The problem lies with the government, which took the issue lightly, as it has done in a number of other debates. It did not take the issue seriously and wasted many weeks thinking, deliberating and waiting instead of acting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667175"> There is something that is very unfortunate and very ironic. Suppose we look at the byelections being held now in Quebec. The Conservatives’ slogan is “Action, not elections”. Unfortunately, just the opposite is happening. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="20">(2220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1667176"> There is no government action. Health Canada approved the H1N1 vaccine on October 21, 2009,and the vaccination campaign started on October 26, first for health workers and then for other groups at high risk, such as children from six months to five years old, people who have compromised immune systems, people living with babies under six months of age or with others who have compromised immune systems, and pregnant women, more specifically, women who are at least 20 weeks pregnant as well as all pregnant women who have a chronic illness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667177"> Most people—and this is the problem—will not be able to start getting vaccinated before December 7. It does not take a genius to know that the flu will have already wreaked havoc by December 7. If the government had not lost so many weeks, we could have started vaccinating people well before the critical point was reached. There is not much danger of the flu spreading in the summer, and the proof is in the fact that the number of people infected with the H1N1 virus went down this summer, at least in the northern hemisphere.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667178">We all know that the critical time will be between December and February. Why did the government not act responsibly and ensure that we had the vaccine in time to reduce the risk of the virus spreading?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667179"> The government’s information campaign has caused total confusion in the target population from beginning to end, whether because of the lack of basic advice or the lack of vaccine. We note, in particular, the time it took to get the H1N1 vaccine approved. Canada was one of the slow ones in this regard. The United States approved it on September 13, Australia on September 18 and France on September 25.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667180"> Those governments acted responsibly. They wasted no time approving it since they already had conclusive results about the vaccine and they made sure to do it as quickly as possible, suspecting that the faster it was approved, the faster the pharmaceutical companies would be able to produce the vaccine, and the faster the public would be able to get vaccinated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667181"> That delay allowed time for the public to become wary of the vaccine's safety and for myths and conspiracy theories to spring up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667182"> I am told I have only two minutes left. I will say that we are very short of time because I could have spoken for hours. I did however talk about it at length in the Standing Committee on Health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667183"> I have to say that the one thing I have noticed regarding the Conservative government on this issue, and it is the same on every issue, is the amateurism with which they have acted. What I find tragic is that this is extremely dangerous because we are talking here about the health of the public. All the Conservatives offer us is not apologies; they simply say that the opposition is playing politics with a subject as serious as the H1N1 flu, when exactly the opposite is true. We have stepped up to our responsibilities, we have questioned the government and we have made our recommendations.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1667184">Mr. Speaker, I hardly know where to begin. I compliment my colleague on an eloquently delivered set of remarks, but it was eloquently delivered rubbish.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667185">He talks about messaging. The messaging from this side of the House has been absolutely clear. The messaging from the Chief Public Health Officer of the country has been absolutely clear.

              <ParaText id="1667186">He talks about delays in getting the vaccine out. The safety of Canadians, the safety of the vaccine, and the effectiveness of the vaccine was a priority for this government. He talks about the U.S. as an example. The U.S., in fact, has had to pull back from the kind of stuff it was putting out because it proved to be non-effective. Does he want us to go down that non-effective road?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667187">He talks about the adjuvanted and unadjuvanted vaccines and the twiddling of thumbs.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1667195">Mr. Speaker, clearly, everything is not okay. The Conservative government made promises and created high expectations with regard to GSK's ability to distribute enough vaccine. The problem is that GSK did not hold up its end of the bargain. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667196">Why did it not hold up its end of the bargain? That is an interesting question. It did not do so because all of a sudden, it turned out that the government did not plan for the production of non-adjuvanted vaccine, or at least, failed to consider its usefulness. What did the government do? It paid dearly for vaccine from Australia and asked GSK—in a politically motivated and amateurish decision—to alter its production line to produce non-adjuvanted vaccine when it suddenly realized that it had nothing to give the highest-risk group, pregnant women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667197">It is clear that everything is not okay. Someone is hiding the truth. Whether that someone is the government, well, if one looks at how it has handled this matter from the beginning, some serious questions have to be asked.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667198">Not long ago, there was talk of supplying 3.5 million doses per week, if I am not mistaken, but actual production has been dramatically lower. So there was a problem and, as I was saying, the problem was with the shift in production priority. From one day to the next, someone decided to change production over to the non-adjuvanted vaccine. Since the very beginning, we have been talking about the underlying problem, which is that there was one single supplier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667199">I see that, unfortunately, I have very little time left. If only the government had dealt with other pharmaceutical companies, they could have helped meet the need in this kind of situation, and we would not be here debating this issue today.</ParaText>

What is unfortunate, as my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128448" Type="2">Guelph</Affiliation> just indicated, is that the Conservatives were much more interested in investing money in things that would pay off politically, such as their infrastructure programs—which they boasted about to no end, but from which we have yet to see any results—for electoral considerations, in order to win the next election, as opposed to investing in an information campaign concerning vaccination.

I must admit, like him, I was also appalled by what the Liberals did, and I invite people to read the evidence of the Standing Committee on Health. Now the problem is that no matter how many mistakes the Liberals made, they do not excuse the Conservative government's mistakes. Furthermore, while the Liberals may have made some mistakes, they are in opposition. The Conservatives, however, are in power, and that is much more dangerous.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1667210">Mr. Speaker, I am listening to the colleagues across the floor and what I am hearing is politicizing. This is a Canadian health concern, a world health concern and I am hearing political grandstanding. I am aboriginal, but first of all, I am Canadian. I joined the RCMP to serve and protect this country. There are members in the House who are doctors who took an oath to help Canadians, and I think this has been lost today and tonight. I am very upset and I am very ashamed to see what has transpired here tonight. That is how I feel. That is what I am going to be saying and I should not have to say anything more. That should be my speech. However, we all have to reflect here tonight. The Liberals opposite may laugh about it, but this is how I feel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667211">Regarding the pandemic planning response for on-reserve first nation communities, this government has worked with all partners to ensure that first nation communities in Canada are prepared for the H1N1 influenza. This is the result of ongoing and tireless efforts among the federal government, provincial governments and most importantly, first nation communities and leadership. We must recognize that pandemic planning for first nation communities is a shared responsibility. When it comes to providing care to first nation communities, ensuring effective collaboration between the different levels of government is paramount.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667212">First nations have been involved since the beginning. From day one we have been working with first nation leaders and provinces to ensure that communities have everything they need in a timely manner based on the best public health advice. The response to H1N1 is a true partnership among the Government of Canada, the governments of the provinces and territories, first nation leaders and first nations communities. We have maintained close contact with first nations from the beginning of the pandemic and have listened closely to their concerns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667213">Given the experience of SARS, the Government of Canada has worked with first nations and provinces over the past few years to raise awareness of the risk of infectious disease and to support the development of community pandemic influenza plans. As an RCMP member, I remember working in close conjunction with the provincial governments and the federal government to develop a pandemic plan that could help police officers deal with the pandemic in their communities, aboriginal or non-aboriginal. These plans reflect the needs of these communities and have been prepared with the support of Health Canada. These plans will enable a sustainable response to future emergencies and will form part of the ongoing emergency preparedness at a local level. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667214">Health Canada continues to provide technical support to first nation communities for the development, testing, revision and implementation at the community level of influenza pandemic plans. We have provided the necessary funding in 2006-07. Health Canada allocated $6.5 million over five years to support pandemic preparedness for on-reserve first nation communities. Health Canada has also secured additional resources for the federal pandemic contingency to support a response to H1N1 outbreaks in first nation communities during the first wave.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667215">Other commitments include, through budget 2009, $305 million over the next two years to strengthen current health programs to improve health outcomes. We have also provided an additional $135 million that would go toward improving health services infrastructure including health clinics and nursing stations in first nation communities. The most recent support to first nation communities has been the response to specific needs expressed by first nations.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1667216">Budget 2009 provides a two-year funding target of $165 million for the completion of drinking water and waste water infrastructure projects to address health and safety priorities on some first nations communities across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667217">Budget 2009 also provides $400 million over two years for innovative approaches to the increase and betterment of on-reserve housing, including new social housing projects, remediation of existing social housing stock, and a range of complementary housing activities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667218">The Canadian pandemic influenza plan includes Annex B, which defines the roles and responsibilities of all partners in the pandemic planning for on-reserve first nations, including the federal and provincial governments and first nations communities. As a result, today nearly all first nation communities across Canada now have a specific community plan that guides their actions in responding to an outbreak of H1N1 influenza. These plans are based on principles of national and provincial pandemic plans, but were developed by first nations community leaders to respond to the unique needs of each community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667219">In addition, close to 90% of these plans have been tested, whether a community has had an outbreak or not, meaning first nations have a high level of readiness and ability to respond to H1N1. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667220">During the first wave, when first nations communities did experience outbreaks, such as those in northern Manitoba, the Government of Canada worked with its partners to ensure a timely, coordinated and comprehensive response. Those communities ably demonstrated that they were able to respond to very difficult situations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667221">We are all aware that first nations communities have been devastated by the epidemics in the past. We are aware of this and have made great efforts to support their communities, to work with them and the provinces, so that the necessary responses have been put in place to reduce, as far as possible, the risk of death and severe illness in first nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667222">We are also aware that H1N1 caused severe disease in the spring in first nations communities, particularly in Manitoba. We responded to the needs of the communities and provided added supplies and support, and we have seen that remote and isolated communities are a priority for the distribution of the vaccine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667223">Health care was provided through community nursing stations to those first nations with influenza-like illness. These facilities were staffed with dedicated, qualified health professionals and provided with all the medical equipment and supplies that were needed, including hand sanitizers, antiviral medications to treat those who are sick, and information on clinical care guidelines and infection control measures. Restocking of essential equipment and supplies for nursing stations can often be done within 24 hours.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667224">In addition, antiviral medications were shipped out in advance of any outbreaks for those first nations communities that were deemed to be at greater risk of an H1N1 outbreak. These antiviral medications continue to be used as a primary response to H1N1 disease while the immunization program rolls out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667225">We continually monitored and adjusted the allocation of health professionals to respond to the needs of first nations communities, and in the case of northern Manitoba, we worked closely with the provinces to help provide additional physicians. Those who were severely ill were provided with emergency medical transportation to the closest provincial hospital to receive the care they required. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667226">Very early on in the first wave of the H1N1 influenza, we recognized that there might be a number of factors that placed first nations communities at greater levels of risk. We know, for example, that younger people aged 16 to 25, pregnant women and people with underlying health conditions face greater risks from H1N1 influenza. We know that first nations are younger than the national average and that the birth rate on reserves is three times higher than it is in the rest of the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667227">We also know that there are higher rates of chronic disease within first nations communities, and that social conditions, including overcrowding and limited access to water for handwashing, pose challenges in minimizing the spread and impact of a number of infectious diseases, including H1N1 influenza.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="45">(2245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1667228">These factors put first nations communities, especially those in remote and isolated areas with limited access to provincial health services, at particular risk for H1N1 influenza. Health Canada, working with its partners, has taken a number of steps to address these risks. Working with Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, we helped to ensure the delivery of supplies of water to communities to support proper handwashing and help prevent and control infections in the home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667229">Special medical adviser Dr. Paul Gully was put in place. He has been responsible for coordinating emergency health services to first nations communities affected by the H1N1 virus. Dr. Gully joined Health Canada following his assignment at the World Health Organization as a deputy United Nations system influenza coordinator. He has also worked previously with Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667230">This government has also worked with first nations and the provinces to ensure that vaccination is a key component of the overall strategy to fight H1N1 influenza. We are working with provincial governments to ensure first nations communities receive H1N1 vaccine as quickly as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667231">Mass immunization clinics are in place in many first nations communities. Remote and isolated communities have been prioritized based on the national sequencing guidelines developed with the provinces and territories. We understand that the uptake rate in many first nations communities has been very high. This is due to the leadership shown by first nations representatives and their promotion of immunization against H1N1.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667232">Immunization clinics in first nations communities began on October 26. We expect that all clinics for remote and isolated first nations communities as a priority group will be in place by the end of this week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667233">Health Canada has supported the rollout of these immunization clinics by training home and community care nurses to provide the H1N1 vaccine and by providing additional health professionals from regional and national offices to go out to first nations communities to support the vaccination efforts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667234">As with any major undertaking of this nature, we face a number of challenges along the way. We have worked closely with our partners to learn from the challenges and improve our collaborative response to H1N1 influenza for first nations communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667235">The minister has met with a number of first nations leaders at the national and provincial levels, and has visited a number of first nations communities, most recently the Cowessess First Nation in my home province of Saskatchewan, to see the community's successful approach to H1N1 pandemic planning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667236">Back in April 2009, the Government of Canada launched a public awareness campaign to inform Canadians about the H1N1 flu virus, including print media reaching first nations audiences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667237">The second cycle of this national marketing campaign is now being rolled out. It includes specific communications products tailored to first nations communities, including radio and print advertisements, and a mail-out of a pamphlet to first nations communities on H1N1 symptoms, infection prevention practices and tips on influenza preparedness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667238">The joint communications protocol signed with the National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations and the <Affiliation DbId="111551" Type="4">Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="128707" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> will strengthen our collaborative efforts and improve communications with first nations communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667239">On November 10, the minister will be co-hosting a first nations H1N1 virtual summit. This virtual summit will provide first nations with a comprehensive overview of pandemic preparedness in an interactive and ongoing format, and will facilitate online participation across the country, including first nations communities and leadership, health technicians and decision makers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667240">This will provide additional information to first nations communities and leadership on H1N1 influenza preparedness and response, including the importance of getting immunized. The timing of this virtual summit is right. It will be able to answer questions of concern to first nations, especially the youth, so we can continue to support the efforts of local first nations leadership.</ParaText>

As a general statement it did.</ParaText>

I certainly know how people in my own riding felt when a medical doctor, a member of the opposite party, sent out the kind of literature that she did, exploiting first nations at the expense of this issue. The member then had the gall to stand up in the House, as several of her colleagues have done today, to say that this is not a political issue.

In fact, first nations in Manitoba have said that clearly from the outset and have asked the government to recognize that fact and ensure that they are able to get access to the vaccine as a high-risk group in our society.</ParaText>

Also, the job of good public health is to stem the spread of contagion. This is something the government did not pay attention to. It did not get enough vaccination. There were many other companies, not just the one company, that it could get vaccination from. It did not do that. As a result, now the people who are susceptible are afraid and now the spread is of great concern. There is no vaccine for people who need it. This is something the government must answer for.

              <ParaText id="1667269">Mr. Speaker, I have obviously been listening to the debate this evening and I want to respond to some of the points that have been made. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667270">I appreciate the opportunity to participate in the debate, particularly after the intervention of my colleague from Repentigny, as well as listening very closely to the comments of my colleague from Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River, and of course, my colleague from St. Paul's who spoke earlier, as well as the Liberal leader.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667271">This debate is important because one of the things we know is that due to the nature of the modern world, we are likely to be facing this kind of issue and this kind of pandemic more often than not. My colleagues opposite have mentioned SARS. There will be lots of time to analyze the responsibilities of federal and provincial governments with respect to SARS. No doubt there will be a public inquiry or review of some kind with respect to this particular issue that we have been dealing with and there will be ample opportunity for all of us to figure out what has happened and what needs to happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667272">However, it is very important for the House to reflect on this question, because there are going to be more such incidents. We know this because the world is getting smaller, because various kinds of diseases that formerly were isolated in one part of the world or another no longer can be isolated, because when they strike their impact is much more sudden, and because certain conditions that affect people, such as asthma, are far more widespread than they were before. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667273">Many of us, if I may speak personally, who have been asthma sufferers for a long time were rather surprised to learn that we are part of the vulnerable community because of susceptibility to the virus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667274">H1N1 came upon us last year. It is an illness about which there was a great deal of concern and anxiety at the beginning because no one quite knew what it meant. It has a severe impact on certain individuals. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1667279">By the way, I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="128541" Type="2">Vancouver Quadra</Affiliation>, who has been waiting patiently for me to utter these all important words, which I now do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667280">There seem to be three assumptions in place. The first one is that the second round, the so-called second wave of H1N1, would come somewhat later in the flu season than in fact it has. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667281">The second assumption of policy seems to have been that one supplier would be best. I look across at my colleagues opposite who I would have thought ideologically might be a little uncomfortable with the notion that a single state-subsidized supplier is going to be the ultimate best solution for national planning. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667282">The third assumption seems to have been that a low-key approach would be the best. The politest term that I think one can apply to the government's approach over the summer is that it was decidedly, from a public standpoint, low-key. The public was not widely informed about H1N1. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667283">My colleague from Peterborough spoke earlier tonight and said he in fact had circulated a flyer throughout his riding. I congratulate him for that. I do not think there were 300 other members who did the same. Perhaps there were, I do not know, but the simple fact of the matter is that the public has not been particularly well informed on this matter, because the government decided for whatever reason that a low-key approach would be best.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="05">(2305)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1667284">There are these three assumptions, and we know one other fact, which is that from the time people get their shot, it takes 10 days for the immunization to take full effect. That is what we are told. That is what the experts tell us. That is what we read in the paper. So from the time people get their shot, they have 10 days in which they have a better chance of being protected from the spread of the virus than they would otherwise have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667285">These three assumptions have been widely shared. They might be called the conventional wisdom that has taken hold of the government. The government has relied on consensus and what it has heard from experts in saying this is the approach that it has decided is the best. There are at least three things that have followed from these assumptions. This is what we need to analyze, understand and recognize as posing a potential problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667286">First, in terms of its impact and the severity of the illness, the second wave of H1N1 has started again without a vaccine being widely available, and in some cases, without a vaccine being ready at all. That is a fact. Members opposite might say, and many of them have, that I am politicizing and engaging in hyperbole. No. Actually, we are looking at the timeframes and saying, when one looks at when the wave started, the vaccine was not widely available. Perhaps the wave started sooner than was expected. We will need to know the answers to these questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667287">Because of what we call a screw-up with respect to the production of the vaccine, there are people in vulnerable groups, including pregnant women, people under the age of 65 who have an underlying condition such as asthma or a heart condition or something else, and young people between the ages of 16 and 25, who are not getting the vaccine this week. They are not getting the vaccine this week because there is not enough vaccine available. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667288">Again I stress that these are simple facts. They are not hyperbole. They are not exaggerations. They are not things that are being thrown around. They are facts. They are unfortunate facts, but they are a reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667289">The second consequence from the decision to have a single supplier, and my colleague from Repentigny has referred to this, is that supplies are affected by bottlenecks and by changes in demand. In speaking today, the minister said that the reason they had a delay was because they decided that they needed to get the flu vaccine before the H1N1 vaccine, as if there is only one place to get the vaccine.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1667290">We do not live in a place where there is no competition. Other companies could have supplied the necessary vaccine, but the government decided that one single company would be responsible for supplying vaccine. I am telling my fellow members that we are all familiar with the problems associated with having a single source. Having a single source causes problems. That is the problem we have now.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1667291">The third consequence, the consequence of the low-key approach, is that the public is not quite as well informed as they need to be with respect to this question. A couple of comments have been made that I found interesting to listen to and important to analyze. The first is a comment by the minister and others. I think Dr. Butler-Jones may have said it, and I think it was the minister who said it. They said that they were not expecting the level of demand that was there. They were not expecting the responses from the public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667292">One can only ask, what exactly were they expecting? If a 13-year-old teenager, tragically, passes away, that is going to have an instant public reaction. That is going to cause a level of public concern. I know it is politically inevitable that there will be charges back and forth with respect to what is taking place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667293">We have asked tough questions. We have a responsibility to do that as the opposition. We have asked for a debate. We have a public debate, and that is a healthy thing. I think it is important that the public be informed, that they be aware of the public policy choices that have been made by the government, and that they be aware of some of the consequences of those choices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667294">If, in the course of events, the government decides to change course to become more active in its publicity and more engaged in its leadership role, and if the public can in fact be better informed as a result of the debate and the controversies and the comments that have been made, then I am one of those who thinks that is a good thing. That is a healthy outcome. It is important for Canadians to be well informed about this issue and it is important for us as Canadians to know the choices that we face.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1667295">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of my colleague opposite. Certainly as one sits and listens and reflects on what he had to say, one realizes that there are different points of view to express on this. However, the fact is that any one of us, and I think the comment was offered earlier this evening, can sit and be a Monday morning quarterback on issues like this. It is easy to look in hindsight to see how one might have done things differently, but one cannot escape the fact that Canada has prepared for this situation. It is far ahead of just about every other jurisdiction in the world and has been complimented for that. </ParaText>

He said that could have been prevented if we had not had the shortages and bottlenecks that we had, but we now have them and we have to deal with the consequences of that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1667308">The second comment I would make is that I think everyone who receives the vaccine, whether it is a private clinic or whether it is a private doctor, has an obligation to follow the priorities that have been clearly established by every expert with respect to who should get vaccinated and who should not be vaccinated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667309">I would certainly share with the hon. member the sense that access to the vaccination should never, ever depend on one's means or the size of one's chequebook or the fact that one is a member of a clinic or not a member of a clinic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667310">As to how it would have happened, I think the simplest explanation is that the provinces each made decisions with respect to where the vaccine would go, whether it was made in one part of the country or another. There were other clinics, I am sure, in Quebec, in British Columbia and elsewhere that have received the vaccine, just as family doctors and others, all of whom are small businessmen, have received the vaccine. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1667313">Mr. Speaker, as I take the privilege of speaking to this emergency debate, I am going to begin by adding to what the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128246" Type="2">Toronto Centre</Affiliation> was saying about the government's low key approach to the issue of H1N1. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667314">I am dismayed at how the government is not taking responsibility for the mistakes that it has made over the course of the last few months. Of course there will be mistakes. Without taking responsibility, the government is just defending itself. It is not learning from those mistakes. That is a disheartening condition that I have observed as a member of the parliamentary Standing Committee on Health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667315">I would like to put on the record the fact that all members on the Standing Committee on Health were determined to treat this as a non-partisan issue. Our job was to try to identify any gaps and put ideas forward, so the government could actually do a better job and be successful. The whole committee was dedicated to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667316">The committee was not made up of a set of armchair quarterbacks as one member mentioned. The committee actually had some leading experts on pandemic preparedness. The committee had an ex-minister of state for public health, who herself had set up, in response to what was learned from SARS, the Public Health Agency of Canada with its budget to deal with pandemic preparedness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667317">There was a set of civil servants who had been working for members of the opposition and now working for government members. They were using a framework that had been set up by Liberal opposition members. Everyone was on the same page.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667318">What started to become very clear was the fact that there were gaps. Opposition members on the committee pointed out that we needed to have updates in the summer because things were going wrong. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667319">Committee members heard that aboriginal communities were not being listened to and were not being served. They heard from representatives of front line caregivers who said there was no coordination. We also heard that the front line people who had to deliver the vaccination and the preparedness plan were disconnected from the structure of the leadership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667320">In hearing those things, committee members took some clear steps toward ensuring that there were summer briefings. They had to drag agreements out of Conservative members in order for the committee to play an oversight role so that parliamentarians could know what was happening and to focus the committee meetings on H1N1 rather than have them be scattershot over the fall on important issues but not yet emergency issues. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667321">Members of the health committee played a constructive role and pointed out things that needed to be done in a constructive way. However, the government has had the pathological inability to take responsibility. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667322">At the risk of sounding political, the government is very good at taking credit, whether it is for the way the public's dollars are spent, or in any number of other ways. Government members have been so obsessed with taking credit, they have forgotten how to take responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667323">The theme of “Everything is okay. Don't worry there will be vaccinations for everyone. Don't worry, be happy. It's all under control” is a theme that we have been hearing at committee for months, meeting after meeting, despite the fact that we had been hearing from representatives of public health, chief medical officers and many other experts that “All is not well”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667324">Yes, we have learned from SARS and there have been improvements, but all is not well. We need to do better. Now we are seeing some of that begin to crystallize. We are not doing a good enough job. Unfortunately, people are suffering as a result of the vaccines being ordered late. As a result of the confusing messages from the government, the supply of vaccines is drying up.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1667325">Not taking responsibility is a key theme with the minister and the government unfortunately and we heard it here tonight. The government has been blaming the provinces and territories, blaming medical experts for the government's own decisions, blaming drug companies, and now blaming the opposition as opposed to taking responsibility. Where is the leadership on this issue? It is completely missing in action. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1667330">I cannot comment on whether this is a proportionate response to a crisis in Ukraine, but it is incumbent on me to point out to the government that in less than 100 days now we will have half a million visitors coming to Vancouver in British Columbia for the 2010 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games. Should we be in a situation such as the Ukraine, it would be a huge disappointment and a huge disturbance of the Olympics that Canadians are so excited about and so proud of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667331">Having been recently in Olympia where the Olympic flame was lit and in Victoria where it was received from Greece, the beginning of the relays across the country, I know how important the Olympics are after so many years of work from an economic perspective, the human perspective, the inspiration to youth and to sports, and the hundreds of thousands of visitors that will come to Canada. We have to do an absolutely impeccable job of preparing for this with the vaccinations, preparing and preventing Vancouver and British Columbia from continuing to be a hot spot and having to consider the Ukraine-type response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667332">The government has been letting British Columbia down. I heard from the provincial medical health officer a number of weeks ago when I asked whether there are adequate resources from the federal government. I heard, “No, we have not received any cost-sharing for actually implementing vaccinations”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667333">At the committee I asked the head of the public health agency if there is a shortage of resources for the provinces and I was told, “No, there will be adequate resources”. But going back to the Vancouver chief medical officer I was told there is no funding for the delivery of a mass vaccination program. That will cost between $8 and $10 per person. That is $25 million to $30 million in British Columbia and not a dollar from the federal government. That is historic, the first time in history that there has been a mass vaccination with no resources from the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667334">I call on the government, as are the Liberal MPs, to put back the $400 million set aside for pandemic response by the Liberals in budget 2006 for this time period, support emergency planning to help local health authorities cope with this issue, and divert the $60 million from the Conservatives' self-advertising of their economic plan and partisan misuse of funds into the pandemic so that people can properly understand what they need to do and respond to that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1667337">There has been more vaccination delivered per capita than any other country in the world.

If I could quote Dalton McGuinty, and I would like to hear the member's comments in regard to this, he said, just last week, that overall we are working the best we can, working closely with the federal government. They decided, by and large, on certain protocols, what is best when it comes to delivering this vaccine. He said he is not an expert.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667339">I think there has to be a debate at one point in time as to the best time for delivering the vaccine, who should be in the first wave, and who should be receiving it.

              <ParaText id="1667345">Mr. Speaker, earlier this afternoon I received a very heartfelt email from a constituent living in Leaside, who asked very clearly that I not try to score political points in this debate tonight but instead try to reach a constructive conclusion to this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667346">The question I have comes directly from this email. It is from a father of a one-year-old and a three-year-old, two daughters, both diagnosed this past weekend with H1N1, and both now on Tamiflu. The concern that he has, however, is the difficulty he had in getting the medicine, Tamiflu, the rationing that is going on with that, and the availability of it in a form that a one-year-old can take. It was not available.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667347">I am wondering if the hon. member, as a member of the health committee, heard from the government about access to Tamiflu, not the vaccine but Tamiflu, as a treatment. As the member for <Affiliation DbId="128246" Type="2">Toronto Centre</Affiliation> said, as this pandemic progresses and we are not able to actually stop it, maybe we are going to have to try to cure it as it comes.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1667353">Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128596" Type="2">Algoma—Manitoulin—Kapuskasing</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667354">First, I begin by reiterating and further supporting the proposition that the leader of my party, the New Democratic Party, made earlier tonight. It is certainly something that our health critic from <Affiliation DbId="128203" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> has been fighting for as well. It is the idea of what the role of the federal government is at this stage in the game.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667355">We have been rehashing and going over the past few months time and time again, but I reiterate the point that we need the federal government to take a stand, to take leadership and to commit to financially supporting the work currently being done on the ground with respect to the rollout of the vaccine, as well in terms of dealing with the flu as it goes on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667356">We need to reassure the partners on the ground, whether they are provincial governments or first nations governments, that it is important, at this time, for them to go all out, to give everything, to put the personnel on the front lines with the support they need to ensure the messages get out, communications-wise, and to ensure we invest in this effort 100%. The only way people will do that is when they know the federal government is there to support those efforts. As we all know, it really comes down to the finances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667357">That proposition is so important to me as the member of Parliament for Churchill. I know what H1N1 means in our region. I had the opportunity earlier to ask a question of the <Affiliation DbId="128707" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation>. For me, H1N1 is a very shocking reality that has been part of the region I come from for quite some time now. The first wave of the flu hit us among the hardest, certainly per capita, in its level of impact compared to many other regions across the country. The impact of H1N1 has been felt most by not only northern Manitobans but by first nations. I want to emphasize that it is not only by first nations in remote communities but first nations across the region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667358">The experience of working with chiefs, with leaders and with health care workers on the ground has been a very trying because of the challenges they have had to face. It was very disillusioning to see that the chiefs, Chief McDougall, Chief Harper and Chief Knott of the Island Lake regions, were getting basically a response of silence by the health minister when more people were being impacted than they had previously anticipated. That silence was a direct reflection of the lack of commitment and concern when it came to what first nations faced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667359"> While I have heard declarations in some of the positive directions that are taking place, I question what that means in terms of action. We heard that the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs had to go out and fund raise to get flu kits that the federal government said were not needed, flu kits that contained Tylenol and thermometers, things that are not easily accessible in remote first nations communities. Essential tools in fighting this pandemic were denied by Canada's government, the government that has the fiduciary obligation to first nations.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="40">(2340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1667360">Time and time again there were real communication challenges for people in regional offices. That breakdown in communication with first nations that were on the front lines of this pandemic was disillusioning as a Canadian, certainly as a member of Parliament, and was a real signal of things to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667361">Many of us back home have anxiety, as do many Canadians, because we know what happened beforehand. Some of that sentiment was an inspiration for people to get on board in terms of planning and networking, but the question of funding and financial support for these initiatives is extremely pertinent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667362">Two weeks ago I met with people working with the MKO, Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak. People show up at the door of the health office. They told me about a family that showed up at the door of the office in Thompson. The family needed a house because there was overcrowding in the community. The family knew that overcrowding helped H1N1 spread. The family wanted to avoid that. It wanted to avoid its children getting sick.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667363">Organizations are trying to cover everything, from concerns about health care professionals coming into communities and avoiding things like burnout. They are trying to be in touch with the federal agencies in the work they are doing. They are having to do everything, including being asked to find homes for people, something that is not written in any document when it comes to the job they are supposed to do. This is the level of anxiety and these are the kinds of needs we face in the north.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667364">MKIO made a proposal, which I supported, asking for direct funding when it came to some of these support roles. We heard it was under consideration, but have yet to hear whether anything will be done. I hope it is an area that is considered for financial funding, recognizing that organizations and people are working long hours day in and day out with great stress. They want to ensure they have the supports needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667365">I also I was pretty horrified to hear that when organizations asked for extra supports, initially they were told to pull out from other programming. What are they supposed to pull people out of, addictions work, suicide prevention? In a moment of need, are these the kinds of priorities people are supposed to choose?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667366">All these services are important in first nations and northern communities. It is pretty disgusting to hear that people are expected to take funding out of essential services to deal with a global pandemic, which we have known for some time was going to hit us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667367">First, I hope this area is very much considered, especially when it comes to working with first nations, as I noted, because of the fiduciary obligation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667368">Second is the element of communication. I know it is a recurring theme. I visited my home town of Thompson and people asked me if they should get the vaccine. This is a real sign that the message is not getting through to Canadians, the confidence and information they need and the anxieties they have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667369">As a member of Parliament, while I would like to think that I can show leadership on a number of areas, the medical area is one that we need to be communicating on a lot better and the federal government needs to be showing leadership on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667370">A lot of work needs to be done. Much of our discussion is focusing on the here and now, as it should, but I hope we can work together at looking at some of the next steps we need to be taking as we fight this virus across our country, for first nations, northerners, rural Canadians and Canadians from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1667388">Mr. Speaker, I stand before you tonight, as have many others, to discuss the serious issue at hand, which is the lack of H1N1 anti-virus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667389"> I have to say that many of us have been quite worried as to whether the government had a good handle on the situation at hand. It became evident toward the end of last week that our fears were well founded. As the weekend progressed, we heard about the long lineups at clinics. Then we heard about clinics turning people away. We heard about pregnant women waiting for hours on end, standing in lineups. That was followed by the headlines this morning about private clinic patients jumping the queue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667390">Had the Liberals and the Conservatives stopped privatization of health care and did what Canadians expected government to do, which is to enforce the Canada Health Act, we would be living in what the father of medicare's vision had founded. Our universal health care would not be two tiered and jumping the queue would not be an issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667391">Tons and tons of concerns have been voiced in the House throughout the day and this evening. The issue is of great concern for many people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667392">A couple of months ago I visited the Pic Mobert First Nation community in my constituency. The residents had some concerns with regard to the directions they were being provided to get ready for the H1N1, such as to name someone to take care of the H1N1 virus in case it hit and to name someone to get out the protocol. The only thing is there was no money attached to hire a person. They wondered what they should do in the meantime. Should they stop giving the preventive medicine that they are giving for the high rate of diabetes in their community? That is a shame. This is a first nation community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667393">We heard from other members with regard to the impact on first nations. We heard about the situation in Manitoba. Some of the highest rates of H1N1 illness are on first nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667394">What is of great concern as well is that there is a high amount of tuberculosis in these communities. It is all linked to the fact that there is poverty, a lack of water and a big problem with housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667395">I met with an elder from Nunavik last week. It was quite evident that even in Nunavik, and we know that the <Affiliation DbId="128634" Type="2">Minister of Health </Affiliation> is from Nunavik, there are big concerns with regard to the housing crisis. People are packed into houses. It is almost as bad as what is happening in our jails these days, where two, three or four people are being packed into a cell that is supposed to hold one person.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667396">Getting back to the first nations, the newspapers showed today that TB is at an all-time high. We probably are experiencing one of the world's biggest pandemics with regard to tuberculosis. It is 100 times the amount that we have seen in other communities. This is only in Manitoba. It is a shame that we are seeing this over and over again. We do need a government that will act on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667397">I received a call from one my constituents in White River. The lady was very worried. We have been telling people to get vaccinated, to get the H1N1 anti-virus. We have been telling people to get that vaccine and yet, when they go to get it, they are turned away. She was very worried because her son is a severe asthmatic and he is high risk. We had to make arrangements. We had to tell them how high risk her son was and that he really needed to get his shot. Finally, they agreed to give him the shot. That family will sleep well tonight, but there are many more families that will not be sleeping well tonight because they are at high risk and they do not know whether they will be able to get their shots tomorrow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667398">We heard about the young boy in Timmins who passed away. There are a few others, one in Ottawa and I believe one near Toronto. It is a sad thing that people are dying. These were healthy people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667399">We have been telling Canadians to get vaccinated, that we are going to be ready to roll this out. The government did not say it was going to be a pilot project and that maybe there would only be enough serum for a couple of days. It is sad that the government cannot see fit to ensure that there is enough vaccine for people.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="55">(2355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1667400">The best thing that happened tonight was something our leader did. The member for <Affiliation DbId="128276" Type="2">Toronto—Danforth</Affiliation> got up and indicated the solutions that we should be looking at at this point. There needs to be better communication. We need to take some of those ads that the current government is running with regard to the infrastructure stimulus and redirect that money into better education on the anticipated vaccine that we hope is going to be coming through again soon, and we need to fund initiatives to help these provinces and communities to deliver those.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667401">As some of my colleagues have indicated through the night, there have been some very serious concerns with respect to how the government has handled the H1N1 file. It would appear that we are seeing a situation similar to the SARS outbreak, which the government cannot seem to get a handle on. We are really hoping that the government will work with opposition members to ensure that everybody's voice is heard and that the communities are not being left out in the cold, as we are seeing today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667402">I want to go back to first nations. I have also not yet mentioned rural communities. In rural communities, it is not very easy for people to displace themselves to go and get the medical help that they need. Some people have to travel quite a ways and others do not even have a way to get there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667403">I will just mention my communities of Pic Mobert First Nation and even Manitouwadge. If they had to go somewhere else to get their shots, it would be very difficult for them to get out of their community because there is no public transportation there. People from Pic Mobert have to travel at least 20 minutes to get to the highway to take a bus to go see the doctor. These communities are finding themselves in hard times and now in harder times, because we are saying that for them it is not a big deal and that they will eventually be able to get the vaccine when it becomes available.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667404">I must reiterate a lot of the information that was provided here tonight. I sit on the health committee, and I know the committee has had a lot of concerns about what has been transpiring here. Lots of questions have been asked. We were always told that everything was rolling out and that everything was on time. Obviously, it has not been.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1667405">I think I have said just about all there is to say on the issue, except that we would really like the government to apologize to those who have not been able to get the vaccine and to ensure that it gets back on board and does everything it can to make sure that people have access to that.</ParaText>
