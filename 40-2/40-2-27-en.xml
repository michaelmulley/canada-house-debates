                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That, in the opinion of the House, by providing only $170 million in funding over two years in the latest budget to assist the forestry industry, the government is showing once again its lack of concern for the Quebec economy, which has been hard hit by the forestry crisis, since this amount falls well short of what this industry needs to see it through the current crisis, especially since this funding will serve to extend programs that are ill-suited to the needs of the industry in crisis; the government should therefore establish a real plan as soon as possible to help the forestry industry, a plan including a series of specific, sustainable development measures, including loans and loan guarantees, refundable tax credits for research and development, a policy to encourage the use of lumber in the construction and renovation of federal public buildings and measures to support energy and ethanol production from forestry waste.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333907">He said: Mr. Speaker, as you know, I come from a region, the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean region, which, in recent years, has been hard hit by the forestry crisis. Quite a few of my colleagues from Quebec and Canada are experiencing similar situations. In our respective regions, whenever the sawmill shuts down, the entire local economy is affected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333908">When I was elected as the member of Parliament for Chicoutimi—Le Fjord in 2004, the forestry industry was going through tough times. In 2004, Abitibi-Consolidated shut down its Port-Alfred plant in La Baie. This resulted in 640 workers being laid off, and the impact could be felt throughout the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean region. Since then, almost 4,000 direct jobs have been lost in the region. That is right, 4,000 jobs. It is as if 15,000 jobs had been lost in the city of Ottawa over the past five years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333909">The Bloc Québécois has chosen to have an opposition day on the forestry crisis and possible solutions to it because the government has completely failed to support the forestry sector, which is in dire need of support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333910">The fact is that the forestry industry has been struggling for several years. First, there was the softwood lumber dispute that started in May 2002 and ended in the fall of 2006. During that time, Ottawa systematically refused to support the industry and provide the loan guarantees it needed to stay afloat. As a result, 10,000 jobs were lost in the forestry industry in Quebec between May 2002 and April 2005. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333911">Since April 2005, a further 21,000 jobs have been lost in the forestry industry in Quebec alone. What is worse, the situation is deteriorating each week. AbitibiBowater has just announced temporary closures of its mills in Amos, Dolbeau-Mistassini and Baie-Comeau. That is not including the pulp mill in Saint-Félicien, the lumber mills in Girardville and Saint-Fulgence, Arbec forest products, Coopérative Forestière de Petit Paris and many others that closed for a few weeks or have drastically cut their production.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333912">We are in the midst of a terrible crisis and we have a government that prefers to ignore the plight of the thousands of workers and families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333913">This is such a serious matter that two weeks ago the president of the Quebec Forest Industry Council testified before the members of the Standing Committee on Finance here in Ottawa to ask for urgent assistance since the industry is at the end of its rope. He came to ask the federal government to establish a refinancing program and a support program in order to be ready for recovery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333914">According to the president, a number of companies need to do major repairs but they cannot currently access credit. A number of them would like to take advantage of the crisis by innovating but simply cannot invest because they have no money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333915">The president of the Quebec Forest Industry Council is not the only one raising the alarm: the message is coming from all sides. Last week, Michel Routhier, president of the FTQ Conseil régional du Haut du Lac-Chibougamau-Chapais, said that the budget is not helping the industry and that there is less help now than when there was no crisis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333916">The crisis being as serious as it is, equipment providers are also calling on the government. Robert Dionne, president of the Association des propriétaires de machinerie forestière du Québec, which represents 250 forestry entrepreneurs, said that his members are worried. They are scrambling to stay afloat. Last week Mr. Dionne said that more than 50 entrepreneurs went out of business in Quebec in 2008 and that the outlook for 2009 is not much brighter. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1333917">Lastly, Alain Michaud of Saint-Ludger-de-Milot, whose business is located in the riding of the <Affiliation DbId="128720" Type="4">Minister of State (Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec)</Affiliation> and member for Roberval—Lac-Saint-Jean, stated that we need to go back to the time when there were tax credits for equipment purchases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333918">The message in the community is unanimous: the federal government must adopt programs to support forestry entrepreneurs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333919">The Canadian and Quebec forestry industry is in no less difficulty than the auto industry. It represents 300,000 direct jobs in Canada, and another 450,000 indirect ones, while the figures for the auto industry are 158,000 direct and 335,000 indirect. Nevertheless, the Conservative government's aid to that sector is far higher than that announced for the forestry industry: $2.7 billion for the auto sector but only $170 million for the forestry industry in all of Canada, over two years. Yes, that is disgraceful. Do you see the disproportion in assistance?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333920">As members of Parliament, we are duty bound to find solutions to help thousands of families. Our fellow citizens have asked us to represent them here in Ottawa to defend their interests. Unfortunately, certain members have chosen to promote their party's position rather than to come to the aid of their fellow citizens and relay their message here to Ottawa, to this House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333921">Among the biggest offenders in this are the members for <Affiliation DbId="128640" Type="2">Roberval—Lac-Saint-Jean</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="128366" Type="2">Jonquière—Alma</Affiliation>. The <Affiliation DbId="128720" Type="4">Minister of State (Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec)</Affiliation> has been stating at every possible opportunity that he cannot, under the softwood lumber agreement, provide any loan guarantees. Yet he is incapable of stating exactly which section of it prevents him from doing so. Even yesterday in question period he was unable to clearly specify which part of the agreement it was, because there is no section that bans such a service of providing loan guarantees to businesses. Unfortunately, the member is obliged to defend the indefensible to back up his party, the Conservative government, since that government is refusing to provide loan guarantees to the forestry sector for purely ideological reasons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333922">Even the president of the Fédération québécoise des municipalités, Bernard Généreux, has commented on the member for <Affiliation DbId="128640" Type="2">Roberval—Lac-Saint-Jean</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="128720" Type="4">Minister of State (Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec)</Affiliation>, “It is a matter of bad faith or lack of imagination. It is unthinkable that, with the billions of dollars of support handed out in the last federal budget, to the auto industry among others, they could not have found some money lying around somewhere to invest in the forestry crisis.” Those were the words of Bernard Généreux, a resident of Lac-Saint-Jean, in the riding of the minister responsible for the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333923">The position of the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128366" Type="2">Jonquière—Alma</Affiliation> is also very disappointing. Seeing that his own government will not help the forestry sector, he is now calling for an emergency summit on the forestry crisis. I cannot help but wonder where the minister has been for the past couple of years. This feels a little like putting smoke detectors in your house after it is already on fire. It appears that the members wants to buy some time. The forestry industry does not need time; what it needs is tools to get through this crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333924">I see today as an emergency debate on the issue, to communicate the message and call attention to the reality facing entrepreneurs and workers in the forestry industry.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1333925">In our motion, we are proposing four concrete solutions based on a sustainable approach for the forestry sector. We are proposing these four solutions because the funds announced in the federal government's last budget are far from sufficient and do not meet the needs of the forestry industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333926">The motion calls on the government to:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...establish a real plan as soon as possible to help the forestry industry, a plan including a series of specific, sustainable development measures, including loans and loan guarantees, refundable tax credits for research and development, a policy to encourage the use of lumber in the construction and renovation of federal public buildings and measures to support energy and ethanol production from forestry waste. </QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333928">I am going to focus on a policy to encourage the use of lumber in the federal government's construction projects. Such a policy would increase the demand for lumber on the domestic markets of Quebec and Canada, and it could make us less dependent on the United States as regards this resource. When the United States stops building houses or lowers its production, lumber sales in that country go down. We are dependent on that market. When residential construction picks up, the Quebec and Canadian lumber is once again in demand. We must reduce our dependency on the U.S. market and increase lumber demand on the domestic markets of Quebec and Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333929">It is easy to talk about problems, but we should also propose solutions. One solution that would be both useful and symbolic would be to have the federal government encourage the use of lumber in the construction and renovation of its own buildings. Let us not forget that the federal government owns a huge real property inventory. We are talking about 13,782 buildings, including 198 that were built in 2008.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333930">This means that, each year, the government spends a significant amount of money on the construction and maintenance of its own buildings. In 2007-08, the Canadian government's maintenance expenditures for Defence, Public Works, Correctional Service Canada and the RCMP alone totalled $827 million. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333931">A number of governments have come to realize that using more lumber in their buildings was not only a concrete way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but that it also provided direct support to the industry. The list of governments that have their own policy on the use of lumber is already quite long and includes Quebec, France, Sweden, Norway, Austria and Finland.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333932">Why does the Canadian government not have its own policy to promote the use of lumber in renovation and construction projects, instead of steel or concrete? It could set an example for private owners of buildings by forcing itself to review in a fair fashion the solution provided by lumber for structural and cosmetic purposes, through its bids and those of its corporations and organizations. If lumber is a relevant option, and if it is beneficial to a project as a whole or to some of its elements, the government's policies should give priority to its use.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333933">By using more lumber, the government itself could reduce the amount of greenhouse gases released by its buildings. For each cubic metre of lumber used instead of concrete or steel, we produce one tonne less of greenhouse gases. For example, during the life cycle of a typical four story building, we could avoid producing 154 tonnes of CO<Sub>2</Sub> by using a structure made of lumber, instead of concrete. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1333934">That is the equivalent of driving a car for 36 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333935">Forestry resources can be a lever for development, provided we find alternative uses, focus more on processing and use forestry as a tool to foster the development of new market niches. Forestry resources must be used to generate more employment and more wealth by increasing processing activities and the production of energy from wood. We must foster research and development for new products and make the R&amp;D tax credit refundable. We must stimulate the creation and development of new processing businesses. We must support the modernization of companies through a loan and loan guarantee program that will allow them to purchase new, more efficient production equipment and to diversify production. We must restore the funding to diversify forest economies, which was cut by the former Minister of Economic Development, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128366" Type="2">Jonquière—Alma</Affiliation> in the fall of 2006, and appoint regional stakeholders to manage it. We must improve the employment insurance plan to prevent workers from leaving the region when their income disappears. When a worker loses his job, becomes unemployed and eventually exhausts his benefits, what does he do? He looks at all possible options, even the possibility of leaving the area, which must be prevented by improving the employment insurance system. We must also put in place an income support program for older workers who are difficult to retrain. We should consider changes to tax rules for private woodlot owners so they can deduct forest management expenses and take advantage of income averaging, particularly when a high income follows a natural catastrophe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333936">Those are some of the solutions the Conservative government should consider to support the regions and the forestry industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333937">I would like to conclude by asking the members of the House, particularly those in the Conservative government, whose ridings are feeling the pinch because of the forestry crisis, to persuade their colleagues to pass the motion I presented this morning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333938">I would point out that this motion urges the government to implement a real plan to help the forestry industry, and quickly. Things are tough in the auto industry, but the government should be helping the forestry industry too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333939">Let us not forget that the boreal forest is located on Quebec and Canadian soil. As such, this resource belongs to Quebeckers and Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333940">Before I wrap up, I would like to summarize the motion, which refers to $170 million over two years. That alone is not enough to help the forestry industry. That amount will not meet the needs of the forestry industry and its workers. The motion proposes a four-part plan: a tax credit to help and support the forestry industry; a loan credit; promoting the use of lumber in construction and renovation; and using forestry waste to make energy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333941">I would like to conclude by pointing out that, in Quebec, 150 towns are fully dependent on forestry, and another 100 towns are 80% dependent on it. I am therefore asking the members to be compassionate and set aside partisan politics. The industry needs our support, and we are in a position to help.</ParaText>

In 2005 we announced a real plan for the forestry sector that addressed the issues at the heart of the motion, such as, loans, support for research and development, new technology, skills development and community adjustments. In 2006 when the Conservative government took over, it cancelled that plan. That is what has affected a lot of communities in British Columbia.</ParaText>

Of course in British Columbia not only do we have issues with the downturn in the market, but we have incredible issues with the pine beetle problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333947">Having said that, I note it has been with great appreciation that our community has received a lot of support from the federal government in terms of dealing with the pine beetle issue. We look forward to the opportunities in the budget and to making sure we leverage them to support our industry, such as extending markets in China. We have companies that have lots of ideas around innovation and the community adaptation fund.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1333949">Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is talking about support and about support programs, but she should take a closer look at the budget and compare a few things. For example, the support for the auto industry stands at $2.7 billion, but there is only a meagre $170 million for the forestry industry throughout Canada. It is clearly not enough. The hon. member being from a province with a big forestry industry, she really has a duty to convince her government that it should provide a real support plan for the forest industry throughout Canada and in Quebec.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1333950">Mr. Speaker, in my region the forestry crisis has reached such a state that Abitibi, which started on the Abitibi River in Iroquois Falls because the province of Ontario gave it wood rights and hydro rights on the dams and is still one of the most profitable operations in Abitibi's world chain, is trying to sell off its dams because it is so desperate for cash right now. Abitibi is in a cash crunch and is basically slitting the throat of one of its most profitable mills. If it has to buy the hydro back from a private enterprise, that mill will go down. Everybody knows that. We are looking at a company like Abitibi that has put 100 years into this region being faced with having to sell off parts of its mill to get through a credit crunch.</ParaText>

It is clear for everybody to see that, unfortunately, the government simply dropped this industry. It chose to support only one sector, the auto industry. It should have taken into account the fact that the forestry industry provides many more jobs. I am not against supporting the auto industry and its jobs, but there are many more jobs in the forestry industry, and it seems to me that the federal government should have had a real plan to help this sector. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1333963">Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to respond to the motion tabled by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128363" Type="2">Chicoutimi—Le Fjord</Affiliation>. I believe the hon. member would agree that he does not hold a monopoly on concern for the forest industry in the province of Quebec. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333964">All members of the House are aware that, since taking office, this government has listened to Canada's forest industry, has recognized the special challenges this industry faces in all parts of the country and has launched a number of specific initiatives to assist Canada's forest industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333965">These initiatives have not been knee-jerk reactions to complex problems. They have been designed to assist the industry in dealing with present day challenges but they have also been designed with the advice of the forest industry, which is to have that industry transition to a stronger, more competitive and sustainable industry in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333966">Of course, the hon. member does not seem to share the concern of the industry in all parts of the country. His concern is only with the industry in the province of Quebec, as if that industry had no connection with the rest of the country. He may not appreciate that measures geared to assist Canada's forest industry as a whole also involve and support the industry in the province of Quebec. It may not occur to him that there is a wider context to the challenges with which he claims to be concerned. It may not occur to him that the solutions proposed to face these challenges must be international as well as regional in scope.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333967">The motion the hon. member has put forward calls for a real plan as though the measures already adopted by this government and the measures proposed in Canada's economic action plan are not real, as though the measures already adopted and being proposed do not have substance, even though the industry, including the forest industry in Quebec, was consulted in devising the plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333968">The motion seems to be a form of self-delusion, if not denial. For the specific proposals put forward in the motion as constituting a real plan, they already exist or are being proposed in Canada's economic action plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333969"> My government is delivering support for an industry that is fundamentally important to our country, an industry that does not exist in one province only and that is facing real challenges. Among these challenges are a world-wide economic downturn, a global increase in competition and a sharp decline in the prices of commodities and products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333970">The long term outlook for Canada's natural resources remains strong but the current economic situation presents an unprecedented mix of challenges for Canada's forest industry. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333971">In order to fully understand recent developments as they have affected the forest industry and to develop a further strategic appropriate response, the government did not hold a conference in Ottawa. My colleagues and I fanned out across the country and undertook extensive unprecedented consultations. We listened to industry leaders, provincial colleagues, territorial colleagues, communities and other stakeholders. We also listened to the people whose local mill had closed down, in some cases the only mill and the only employment in town.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333972">We listened to the forest industry in all provinces of the country, not just the industry in one province. What did we hear? We heard that even though Canadians recognized that the current economic crisis originated outside our borders, they expected stable leadership that would protect and advance our economy today and in the future. They do not want economic uncertainty compounded by petty political rivalry. They want strong balanced leadership that offers a clear vision for the future and how to capitalize on Canada's advantages to realize that future.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="40">(1040)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1333973">Canadians are also aware that we continue to fare much better than other countries, thanks, in a large part, to the decisions the present government made. Nevertheless, they realize Canada is not an island and that success in meeting today's economic challenges requires leadership in aligning our national interests with the interests of others. This is a global crisis, not a provincial crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333974">We also heard that this crisis affords opportunities, opportunities to put measures in place today that will pay off down the road. In other words, we do not want short term, short-sighted ideological thinking aimed only at achieving immediate relief. Canadians recognize and Canadians in the forest industry recognize that the only worthwhile strategy consists of smart investments, not bailouts, investments that will strengthen Canada's advantage in the long term. This has been the strategy of our government since the day it first took office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333975">In accordance with that strategy, forest sector stakeholders called on our government for further support in areas such as worker and community adjustment, innovation, market development, access to credit and taxation. Canada's economic action plan includes a variety of such measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333976">For example, $1 billion have been committed to a community adjustment fund to create jobs and maintain employment in communities that have been strongly affected by the downturn in the economy, such as forestry communities. This is in addition to the $1 billion already provided through the community development trust, which was established in 2008.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333977">Time and again in our pre-budget consultations with Canadians across the country, we were asked for help to support workers and communities. The community adjustment fund will help immediately by mitigating the short term impacts of restructuring in these communities, such as forestry communities located in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333978">The fund will also support activities in areas of science and technology, community transition plans that foster economic development and other measures to promote economic diversification in various communities, such as in resource-based and manufacturing dependent communities. A total of $428 million in investments are being provided to the Province of Quebec, through the community development trust and the community adjustment fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333979">I recognize the importance of these measures. I grew up in Cape Breton in the 1980s and the early 1990s. In those years in the community of Sydney, specifically, in Whitney Pier, we saw the closing of the steel mills, the closing of the coal mines and the complete shutdown of the cod fishery. Like the hon. member, I know what can happen to a community when key industries are no longer there and I know the benefits that adjustment funds can bring in these situations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333980">Our economic action plan provides $170 million over two years to support market diversification and innovation and improve competitiveness in the forest sector. The motion before us refers to this investment as only $170 million in funding. That shows me a lack of concern for the Quebec economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333981">This investment includes $80 million for the transformative technologies program administered by FPInnovations headquartered in Quebec and $40 million to develop pilot scale demonstration projects of new products for use in commercial application. Those are precisely the kinds of program cited in the hon. member's motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333982">An additional $50 million is earmarked for expanding domestic and international markets for Canadian forest products and to support large scale demonstrations of Canadian use of wood in construction. This includes funding to support efforts to encourage greater use of woods in non-residential construction across North America.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333983">In Quebec, we are pleased to support the cecobois initiative as part of our strategy to grow demand for wood products.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="45">(1045)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1333984">There is a green element to these initiatives that is very important. After all, we cannot get more sustainable than wood. Wood is renewable, it stores carbon, and life-cycle analysis tells us it has a very low carbon footprint. We need to find ways to market wood and wood products to serve a growing need globally for sustainable products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333985"> Sustainable development is our greatest competitive advantage. That is why it must be embraced as an opportunity, not as a cost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333986">Economically, sustainable development can mean the difference between short- and long-term competitiveness. Socially, it can be a determinant for quality of life and the livelihood of individuals and communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333987">Forest industry leaders across Canada also told us that access to credit was a key priority for them. Through a combination of existing measures and new initiatives in the budget, an extraordinary financing framework will allow our government to provide up to $200 billion to improve access to financing for Canadian households and businesses. More specifically, for newer businesses, our economic action plan provides measures that can include at least $5 billion in new financing, to be delivered under our new initative, the business credit availability program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333988">Budget 2009 also provided Export Development Canada, EDC, with more financial flexibility to support business during the current economic downturn. EDC has working relationships with more than 90% of the Canadian forest industry and has new flexibility to firms in the forest sector and across the economy to address financing gaps in the credit markets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333989">There will be up to $50 billion in additional insured mortgage pools through the insured mortgage purchase program, bringing the overall size of this initiative to as much as $125 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333990">We are determined that these measures will assist in stimulating house construction and spawn new and innovative businesses with a beneficial effect on the forest industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333991">Canada's economic action plan provides one of the largest infrastructure-building programs in our country's history. This too will have a beneficial effect on the forest industry. Infrastructure funding will include $4 billion in new funding for local and regional projects, $2 billion for urgently needed repairs at our universities and colleges, and $1 billion for a green infrastructure fund to support projects such as sustainable energy. This is in addition to the $33 billion for longer term projects our government has already committed under the building Canada plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333992">As members know, there will be a new home renovation tax credit, providing eligibility for up to $1,300 in tax relief for Canadians undertaking home renovations. Each time Canadians invest in home renovations, they are helping to create jobs in construction and in building supplies in their own communities. In fact, the budget provides as much as $7.8 billion to build quality housing, stimulate construction, and enhance energy efficiency through the eco-energy home retrofit program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333993">Given the importance of wood in construction and renovation, this will stimulate additional domestic demand for Canadian wood and Canadian wood products, perhaps more than a billion board feet of lumber and hundreds of thousands of cubic metres of wood panels.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333994">Our budget also builds on earlier measures to give Canada a tax advantage in the global competition for investment in manufacturing. Budget 2009 included an extension of the accelerated capital cost allowance to a flat-line two-year depreciation through the year 2011.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333995">Our economic action plan permanently eliminates tariffs on a range of machinery and equipment, thus lowering costs for Canadian producers in a number of sectors. These include forestry and energy, and this measure is expected to save Canadian industry more than $440 million over the next five years.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="50">(1050)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1333996">To assist workers and their families, there is an $8.3 billion Canada skills and transition strategy to help Canadians by means of a three-pronged approach: to strengthen benefits for workers, to enhance the availability of training, and to keep employment insurance rates low for 2009 and 2010. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333997">Finally, Canada's economic action plan provides a $1 billion investment to establish a clean energy fund to nurture the development and demonstration of clean energy technologies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333998">These budget measures are not a series of isolated programs designed to prod our economy from different angles. They constitute a whole and integrated approach to economic stimulus in which these programs reinforce and build on each other. They constitute a real plan. The objective is to spur innovation now in ways that will reap even greater benefits later on. Evidence of success can be seen in the variety of initiatives that are appearing in the forest sector today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1333999">For example, FPInnovations, our national forest research institute, has been working with a national network of university experts on the development of paper-based biosensors that can detect, report and destroy toxins and pathogens such as SARS and listeria. This network is pan-Canadian and includes researchers at five different universities in Quebec: McGill University, Concordia, École Polytechnique de Montréal, Université de Montréal and Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334000">In addition, FPInnovations is collaborating with industry to develop next-generation building systems. These systems include design for the construction of six- to eight-storey buildings using a combination of wood, concrete and steel building materials. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334001">Our government's focus is to build on our strengths: our deep and diverse resource endowment, the systems that support its development, and the people and ideas that together are responsible for Canada's resource advantage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334002">The measures I have mentioned are precisely the kinds of measures cited in the motion before us. Unlike the motion, however, they are not focused exclusively on one province. They are focused on Canada's national forest industry in all provinces, including the province of Quebec. Moreover, they reflect what the industry has told us they want. They reflect what members of the forest industry in the province of Quebec have told us they want.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334003">In conclusion, I would suggest the hon. member not be so fast in characterizing the measures proposed by the industry in his own province as constituting no real plan.</ParaText>

Those three plants have merged to form a single plant in order to restructure and reorganize. The administrators of this new sawmill have applied to various federal offices to obtain the funding that was announced in the latest budget. They knocked on doors at the Business Development Bank of Canada, and also at CED. Those offices told them that they had nothing for forestry.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334008">Mr. Speaker, first I want to say, as I indicated in my remarks, I understand only too well the devastating effects of companies closing down in communities, the effects on the families and workers, and the ongoing effects on the community in general. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334009">That is why we as a government brought in not only the community development trust to aid at the very beginning of this forestry crisis but we put a further $1 billion into the community adjustment fund to deal with the after-effects of the reality of the fact that we are suffering in an economic downturn and the industry is facing structural challenges, in and of itself, those two forces coming together at the same time. That is why this government has recognized the effect on the communities and made those two pieces of funding available for communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334010">With respect to the specific example of forestry companies seeking credit access, as I mentioned as well, we in this government have taken unprecedented measures to make sure that there is financing available across all sectors, including the forestry sector. As I indicated, there is over $200 billion available in the extraordinary financing framework. We recognize that as being important because, quite frankly, it is something that we were told by the entire industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334011">I hope that is helpful for the communities and the industry as well.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1334012">Mr. Speaker, I agree with the minister that it is not just Quebec but the entire nation. I thank her for bringing that up. However, I have a couple of pointed questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334013">First, would the minister consider loans or loan guarantees a bailout or an investment? Also, is biomass investment, which is talked about in this motion, a bailout or an investment? She compared and contrasted those terms, but I want to know exactly what specific measures she would put into either bailout or investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334014">She talked about the community trust fund. Essentially, here is the problem. The community trust fund is designed primarily for failed communities and not those who are failing. As I mentioned earlier, there is a mill closing down at the end of this month in my riding of Bonavista—Gander—Grand Falls—Windsor. It is AbitibiBowater. How would this community trust fund help these people keep that mill open? That is the specific question, not what it will do as far as communities that have seen mill closures are concerned, but how will the community trust fund keep that mill or other mills open?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334015">Finally, she talked about consultations far and wide. Will she table documents pertaining to input regarding all her consultations across this country, with all stakeholders?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1334016">Mr. Speaker, I will start with the last question first. We have actually itemized the results of the consultation. I invite the member to read the economic action plan, because that is exactly what it was. We went across the country, consulted with the industry, and put the comments in the plan that we are currently trying to implement and that we would like to continue to implement for the sake of all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334017">With respect to the parsing of the words “bailout” versus “investment”, the reality is that we have put together an incredibly comprehensive strategy to take the Canadian forest industry through to the future and deal with the realities of what we have now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334018">It is obviously unfortunate, and coming from the same part of the country, the east coast, where we have experienced downturns, I fully understand and I feel for the people of <Affiliation DbId="128652" Type="2">Bonavista—Gander—Grand Falls—Windsor</Affiliation> in that respect. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334019">However, one provides the strategy not only to have the companies flourish, but for the industry to flourish so that someday maybe that mill will open again, but in the meantime, one has to look after the people. That is what the community adjustment fund does. It allows communities to economically diversify so that they are not single-industry towns and they can prevent the downturn from happening again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334020">Just to elaborate a little, anytime the government recognizes the importance of investing in innovation and research and development to take wood, this wonderful product and resource we have in Canada, and lever it, make it better, and bring it into the next generation, that is certainly not a bailout. That is totally an investment. It is a belief in this country, a belief in the people of this country, and that is exactly what the strategy is for this government.</ParaText>

I do too and so does everyone else in the House, and all Canadians. I have spoken to the minister on numerous occasions and I know her heart is in the right place, which is with the forestry workers and families right across Canada. Although there were some afternoon round tables last year, much has changed since then.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334023">Mr. Speaker, as the member pointed out, we have had the opportunity to talk about the situation in Rainy River and Thunder Bay. It is of great concern to him and it is of great concern to us as well. I am always happy to speak with any member in the House regarding forestry issues within their riding, so without question, I would be happy to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334024">With respect to setting up a forestry summit, we have done broad-based consultations across the country. I continue to meet with industry people across the country. I would be happy to discuss the concept with the members in the House to determine what kind of agenda could be set up and whether or not this is the right time to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334025">The reality is that we have developed a strategy. The strategy is in the economic action plan. We are now fully on the implementation and execution of that strategy in accordance with the needs of the industry. The communities have told us what they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334026">On one side it is marketing and innovation of the forestry products and on the other side it is making sure that communities and workers have both help through the employment insurance work share programs as well as general help for economic diversification in the communities hardest hit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334027">Within that spectrum, I would be happy to speak with anybody in the House, but we must realize that there has been enough talk on this matter. We have put our strategy in place. It is in the economic action plan. I truly wish that if the member did feel for the workers in his community, he would go ahead and vote in favour of this economic action plan, so that we can get it going and get the communities where they need to be, which is with money and with better help.</ParaText>

I think he will be speaking among other things about the softwood lumber deal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334034">I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak today about the crisis that is facing our forestry sector. The crisis is affecting thousands of families and their communities in every region and every province.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334035">The minister spoke a few moments ago about the situation in the economy and the government's economic plan. However, one of the things that is very disturbing to us in the opposition and to Canadians across the country is what we are not seeing and what we have not seen in recent months from the government, and that is real action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334036">We know that in the 2007 budget $4.6 billion was approved for infrastructure. Of that money, only a billion has been spent. If the government were truly concerned, if it were truly awake to the situation facing the economy of this country, we would think that it would have long before now started to get that money moving. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334037">In fact, we have heard claims from the government side that when the government cut the GST nearly two years ago that was really because it knew there were going to be problems in the economy, that it foresaw these economic problems. If that were true, which it clearly is not, surely the government would have also launched spending programs to stimulate the economy to prevent us from having the problems we are now in. Unfortunately, we did not see that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334038">What are the results? Just last week in my province of Nova Scotia, AbitibiBowater and Minas Basin Pulp and Power announced shutdowns and layoffs that will leave hundreds of families with an uncertain future. Those people are worried about putting groceries on the table, about paying the mortgage and looking after their kids. It is the same story in dozens of communities across Canada, whether it is Domtar, Canfor or Tembec making the headlines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334039">Like other opposition MPs in other parties, the Liberal caucus is concerned with the fate of an industry that is vital to over 300 Canadian communities and has spinoffs in many other communities. So many of these communities are in rural areas and forestry makes up at least 50% of the economic base, particularly in those rural areas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334040">When we see employment in this sector fall by 9.1% as it did in 2007, we know that many of these small communities are severely impacted by such significant job losses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334041">Since 2006 the forestry industry has looked to government to establish a plan of action. The Bloc Québécois motion talks about some specific policies it thinks should be included in our forestry policy: refundable tax credits for research and development and measures to support energy and ethanol production from forestry waste, and we look forward to that being developed because there is a lot of research going on, as we know, into cellulosic ethanol which is a hopeful product for the future and I think that is a very good suggestion; the use of loans for loan guarantees; policies to encourage the use of lumber in construction; and the renovation of federal buildings. I think all of these are worthwhile suggestions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334042">The fact is the Conservative government should have already developed a plan for the forestry sector. The Conservatives have known, as I was saying earlier, for several years now that in this case, and they may have not really known what has happened to the economy over the past six months, the forestry industry was in trouble. That has been clear for quite a while. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334043">In fact, in June of last year the Standing Committee on Natural Resources produced a report that outlined 23 recommendations but then, like now, the Conservatives failed to recognize how serious the problem was and failed to provide any meaningful assistance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334044">Here is a news flash. Tax cuts are not much help if one is not making a profit. All the Conservative government has delivered are empty promises, political rhetoric and recycled programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334045">Several weeks ago the <Affiliation DbId="128708" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> was in Sydney, Nova Scotia, where she grew up, her home town, to announce a worn over $1 billion community development fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText Interjection="e1" id="1334046">
                <Affiliation DbId="128696" Type="4">Hon. John Baird</Affiliation> You're going to hurt my feelings.</ParaText>

                <Affiliation DbId="128433">Hon. Geoff Regan: </Affiliation> Mr. Speaker, I am sure the hon. minister wants to hear the points I am making and I am sure that he will settle down and listen quietly.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1334048">The announcement of the $1 billion community development fund that she made in Sydney looked suspiciously like the same announcement made a year earlier. That is not good enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334049">Instead of investing in a stimulus package over a year ago, the Conservatives sat on that $4.6 billion, that I mentioned earlier, that was approved in the 2007 budget for this current fiscal year that ends at the end of this month. Canadians cannot understand why the government was so incompetent that it spent less than $1 billion of that money, especially if, as it claimed, it foresaw all these economic problems. How is that possible? It certainly makes no sense to me and I am sure my hon. colleagues on this side of the House would agree.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334050">In New Brunswick, there is a shovel-ready project that could put 400 people to work for a nominal cost. It is called silviculture. The New Brunswick Forest Products Association has made a request to the federal government but still has not received a decision from Ottawa. The association hopes that someone in the government across the way recognizes that this is important for an industry that has endured thousands of job losses in the past three years. It is warning all of us that time is running out to get that money flowing for the 2009 planting season. I do hope that someone in the Department of Natural Resources or in the government is listening, and that they will get moving on this request and others from across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334051">Is it any wonder that people do not trust the Conservative government when we hear of things like that? The latest performance report for natural resources shows the Conservatives have a history of not getting the job done that goes well beyond its infrastructure investments or the lack thereof.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334052">The NRCan performance report states that “funding for the Forest Industry Long Term Competitiveness Initiative in the amount of $10.4 million was deferred for future year spending”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334053">That is a little hard to imagine. I was just talking about, and we heard it earlier today, what is happening in the forestry industry. The recent economic problems have added to it, but it is not a brand new problem. There have been problems and difficulties in the forestry industry for the past number of years, and yet here we see that the government, rather than using the money that it has allocated and promised to use to support the industry, has put it off for later. What the heck is that about? How is that competent management of the industry or of our economy? Why would any competent government defer spending on an industry that was obviously facing severe challenges?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334054">I believe this speaks volumes about the government's lack of commitment to a vital sector of our economy and the thousands of families who keep asking why the government has abandoned them in their hour of need. As I said earlier, it is no wonder that Canadians do not trust the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334055">Unfortunately, Canadian forestry workers, whether they live in Nova Scotia, Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia or elsewhere, are the ones suffering as a result of a government that failed to invest in their futures, that failed to understand the importance of research and development, and a government that negotiated a sellout softwood lumber deal, about which my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128098" Type="2">Westmount—Ville-Marie</Affiliation> will speak further.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334056">The fallout from the Conservative softwood lumber sellout continues to plague the sector. Saw mills in four provinces are now subject to a 10% export tax. Even in the face of mill closures in Quebec and Ontario, the Conservatives refuse to admit this is a bad deal. Ontario companies will have to pay in excess of $68 million to meet the 10% export charge imposed because of bad decisions by the Conservatives. It is why we are here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334057">Canadians know the Conservative government abandoned the forestry sector by not preparing the industry for the current economic downturn several years ago. In contrast, in November 2005, the Liberal government committed $1.5 million for the strength and sustainability of Canada's forestry industry. This strategy included new funding for workers, the industry, communities, long-term innovation, and provided immediate assistance as well.</ParaText>

In fact, it was $1 billion, not $1 million. Maybe the hon. member was doing it in error, but they are two separate funds and he is confused on that matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334061">In fact, on those funds, we had the support of the vast majority of the provinces that put out that money. I know in my home province of British Columbia, Premier Campbell put out that money on a number of different initiatives to help the forestry communities and workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334062">Our government has been investing from the very beginning across the forest sector. There is no question that sector is in very challenging times. We know that. We understand that. We have sat down on numerous occasions with forest products executives and asked what we can do. We have listened and are making those investments in what they have been suggesting. We are working very closely with them. We are bringing the research institutes across Canada all under FPInnovations, under one leadership, and putting funds in there.</ParaText>

That is what we have not seen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334065">I was talking a moment ago about the $1.5 billion committed by the previous government, the Liberal government, in November 2005. That $1.5 billion program was cancelled by the Conservative government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334066">I talked a few minutes ago about the kind of funding that the government had available, even in this fiscal year, the $4.6 billion it has not been spending. It is very disappointing to people across this country that in an economic downturn like this one, the government has not responded and has not foreseen what was needed.

              <ParaText id="1334068">One is on the pine beetle funding, which we looked for in this budget and could not find. In fact, we have had it confirmed from the Canadian Forest Service that there is none. Folks living in my region of northwestern British Columbia are still watching the devastating effects of the pine beetle, which has been a contributing factor.

On the other hand, it is clear to me from Canadians that they want to see stimulus get out the door. There is no sign the government is doing anything so far in terms of stimulus. Of course, as the Conservatives know, their own proposal is not to spend a dime of the budget money until April 1 or perhaps later. There are reasons for that, as the member knows.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334075"> I thank my Bloc colleague for his motion and want him to know right off that I share his opinion on the need to establish a plan to help the forest industry. My party therefore supports the spirit of this motion. However, my colleague will not be surprised to hear me say that the plan should apply to the industry as a whole and not just to the portion of it in la belle province of Quebec. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334076"> The forest industry in Quebec, the Maritimes, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia is facing major challenges these days. If we think back, we will remember that the Liberal government itself put forward a forestry strategy in 2005. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1334077">On November 24, 2005, the Liberal government announced, in partnership with forest industry stakeholders, a true plan for the forestry sector, a forest industry competitiveness strategy committing $1.5 billion over five years. This strategy included: $215 million for the development of new technologies in areas such as the pulp and paper industry to enhance its competitiveness; $50 million to support the forest industry to develop bioenergy and cogeneration power technology; $90 million to support innovation in value-added wood products; $66 million in wood product market development; $10 million to enhance workplace skills in the forest sector; $150 million to help forest dependent communities diversify economically; $800 million in loan support to help Canada's forest companies invest to improve competitiveness; and $100 million in loan support for small forest sector businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334078">We can see that the Liberal government had anticipated quite a bit of what is happening today. Upon forming government in 2006, the Conservatives, however, cancelled the plan. Today Canadian forestry workers are paying the price for that action. Instead of investing then in improving technology, skills and competitiveness to strengthen the industry and to save jobs, Canada now faces tens of thousands of job losses. Since the Conservatives took over government, Canada has lost 18,000 forest sector jobs. Not only that, they negotiated a poor settlement on the softwood lumber dispute and we are paying the price today.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334079"> As regards the softwood lumber agreement with the United States, the Liberal Party of Canada has always supported a two-step approach to resolving the dispute over softwood lumber—arbitration by the courts and negotiation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334080">On September 19, 2006, the Liberal Party voted against the agreement on softwood lumber, and, on December 6, 2006, against Bill <Document DbId="2334521" Type="3">C-24</Document> on the softwood lumber export fees. The Liberal Party wanted to be sure the Conservative government would respect the North American Free Trade Agreement and keep its election promise to recover all the customs duties collected illegally by the United States. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334081">We believe the softwood lumber agreement is full of holes for the following reasons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334082"> It is a reversal of the position adopted by successive federal governments and supported by NAFTA and World Trade Organization trade panels that our softwood lumber sector is not subsidized. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334083">It compromises Canada's chances of helping a sector already in difficulty, by handing part of our sovereignty over our natural resources to our American competitors. The fallout of such capitulation will be felt in future disputes, which will no doubt arise not only in the softwood lumber industry, but also in other sectors facing the same accusations by our American competitors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334084"> It creates an export tax, which, at the current rate, is in fact higher than the illegal American customs duties of the past.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334085"> It strips NAFTA of any credibility as arbitrator of trade disputes and voids the principles governing such discussions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334086"> It drops $500 million into the hands of the American forestry sector, which uses it to fund legal and political attacks against the Canadian industry and another $500 million into the hands of the American government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334087">And, finally, it contains anti fluctuation provisions that will deny the Canadian industry the flexibility it needs to deal with the unexpected, such as the infestation of the pine beetle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334088"> The Conservatives claim that their softwood lumber agreement put an end to the dispute, but the United States began consultations questioning the forestry policies of Ontario and Quebec within seven months of signing the agreement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334089">Nova Scotia, British Columbia and Alberta face the same attacks. It is the $500 million the Conservatives handed over to the Americans that is being used to finance these attacks. On April 4, 2007, the Liberal Party announced that a Liberal government would organize a national summit on the forestry sector bringing together the stakeholders—public officials, the localities involved and the forestry sector—to work out responsible measures for the environment and protect jobs in the Canadian localities. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334106">As the New Democrat critic for forestry, I thank the Bloc Québécois caucus for tabling this motion and for putting the interests of our forestry industry, our forestry dependent communities and our forestry related workers on the legislative agenda.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334107">For many inside and outside of Quebec, the size and importance of this industry and the depth of the crisis in which it is mired is simply not known. I have some facts about this important industry. The forestry industry is an $84 billion a year industry. It directly and indirectly employs 863,000 Canadians. Forestry related manufacturing accounts for a full 12% of Canada's total manufacturing output, and there have been more than 45,000 layoffs and job losses in the industry since 2003.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334108">Between January 2003 and June 2008, there have been at least 26 permanent mill closures in Quebec alone and more than 54 indefinite closures. Together, these closures have cost the forestry industry, communities and the families of Quebec more than 11,000 well-paying jobs. The number of mill closures and job losses related to the forestry industry in Quebec during this period were more than the share of any other province in Canada during this period. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334109">We must make no mistake, the forestry sector in Canada is in a crisis and the forestry industry, communities and families in Quebec are suffering a great deal. I find much I am in agreement with in this motion by the Bloc. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334110">The $170 million for the forestry sector in the budget pales in comparison to the nearly $4 billion in assistance for the auto sector. That is not to say that the auto sector does not clearly need it, but the forestry industry has been completely ignored by the government. These two industries are roughly the same size but the forestry industry employs nearly 400,000 more people and it has had more than four times the real and potential job losses of the auto sector. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334111">The government has shown little interest in Canada's forestry industry, our communities and our workers, and I am glad that this motion states as much.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334112">The Bloc is correct in noting that the forestry industry urgently requires loans and loan guarantees from our federal government. Small and large producers began having their credit lines cut three years ago, so the payroll cuts that have occurred during this period are no surprise. Loans and guarantees will help Canada's modern and efficient mills keep operating, which will keep our small communities active and keep our hard-working families housed and fed during this downturn.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334113">We also need a made in Canada policy for federal procurement so that Canadian lumber is used in all federally subsidized building projects in order to keep our lumber and wood product inventories turning over.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334114">We also need more research, development and utilization of biomass technology and products. The Atikokan Bio-Energy Research Centre is within the boundaries of my riding.

              <ParaText id="1334132">Is the member aware, though, that, in its last sitting, the natural resources committee conducted an exhaustive series of hearings and came out with a report that was to set the stage for the summit that the member is calling for? It gives an overview historically of what happened with respect to the sector. It talks about an action plan, such as the procurement approach that the member is suggesting. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334133">I have more of a leading question. Would the member take a look at that report? After looking at the report, he may be satisfied that that would be the foundation for the summit that he is asking for and that the government really can get on with the action that is in that report.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1334140">Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to be able to speak about this issue, which is important not only for the people of my riding, Algoma—Manitoulin—Kapuskasing, but also for many other communities across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334141">This motion is timely, but it is sad that the government was not aware that it should have used the budget it so recently tabled to respond to the forestry industry's concerns. The government is letting an opportunity go by and if it were not for the opposition parties, the challenges facing the forestry industry would not be raised.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1334142">The forestry industry was one of the first sectors to feel the current economic pinch. When the housing bubble broke in the United States, the effect was seen in the dropping sales of forestry products long before the remainder of the economy began to feel the fallout of that contraction. It would have been a good time to act and then to stem some of the bleeding. It was a time to be proactive and show Canadians that their government was working for them, that it was out to protect them, that it recognized the warning signs and had a plan to help them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334143">However, the government does not operate that way. To be fair, it is hard to notice these kinds of trends when people have their heads stuck in the sand. Instead, the government is acting as if all is well in the forestry sector. It would like to have people believe that there is nothing but sunshine as a result of the softwood lumber agreement it reached with the United States. It turns out that the softwood issue was a bit of foreshadowing on things to come from the United States. Increasingly, the U.S. has become protectionist, abandoning the nuts and bolts of trade agreements and hiding behind state laws that allow for protectionist procurement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334144">We see this right now with respect to the steel and iron exports and have seen a protectionist agenda at play with the flawed deal the government negotiated for softwood lumber exports. Now that we have entered a global credit crunch, we see just how bad that agreement is. We also see just how unprepared the government is to deal with real financial challenges. It has no idea what it is meant to do. It throws money at construction and trades and ignores our resource-based jobs. It has a cart on a different track than the horse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334145">The government is so far off the mark with its stimulus. With only $170 million over two years, there is little in the way of recognition of the severity of the problems that face the forestry sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334146"> I have done something that I hope many other members have done as well. I have met with forestry companies in my constituency and have discussed the challenges they face. I say hope because I cannot see the evidence that shows me many government MPs have in fact done this. I do not believe the government's response to the sector matches what I was told it required to get through the credit crunch we are experiencing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334147">First and foremost, companies are asking for access to reasonable credit to keep their operations above water. They are not asking for a bailout. They are only asking for a leg up. However, it will take much more than the $170 million over two years. They are asking for tax incentives for investment and innovation. They are looking for investment to help with developing and promoting products. They would like to see waste from the industry become part of a green solution for our energy needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334148">These seem like reasonable requests from an industry we are absolutely certain will rebound from this downturn. We truly believe it is important to keep this sector working. We have too many examples of what can happen when the mills shut down. In northern Ontario, there are many shrinking communities and a pressing need to reverse this trend. We will climb out of this recession. When we do so, we are going to need these communities. We are going to need these workers as well as the forestry products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334149">The population is dropping at an alarming rate in places like White River. If we do not take the time to protect these small communities, we will have to spend even more to bring these communities back to the vibrant places they are, or have been recently, where a family can live and workers do not have to worry about the basics and can concentrate on putting out a good product. There are tools to help retain these communities. There are ways to ensure that a town does not have to disintegrate because a plant shuts down or a mill closes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334150">We can use their products as much as possible. We can ensure that the employment insurance system works to keep these workers in their communities and help keep these communities vibrant so they will be there when we need them. We can implement income support programs for those older workers who will have the most difficulty relocating. Economists like to think in terms of market rationalization, cheap, portable labour. These all sound like great concepts until workers realize that they are cheap, portable labour and that the death of their own towns and destruction of their way of life is the market being rational. It is a story that is repeated time and again in northern Ontario and it does not have to be this way. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1334151">I am not naive. I realize there will be situations where workers will simply have to go and find another place of employment. We could do something to help with that as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334152">The Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union is calling for the establishment of a national adjustment fund for workers, their families and communities in the event of closure or restructuring, but we have heard nothing from the government about this. Shame on it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334153">CEP is also calling for the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to call a national summit on the future of the forestry industry. We would welcome such a move and would see it as a sign of recognition from the government that there is a problem and that it has a role to play in the remedy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334154">This makes great sense. The forestry sector is vital to the Canadian economy. It is very comparable to the auto industry, yet is not receiving the same level of attention from the federal government. Perhaps we should be considering government assistance on a level similar to that being proposed for the auto industry. We have to remember that the forest products sector is one of Canada's leading industries, shipping over $40 billion of goods annually. We have to keep our eye on the fact that forestry provides hundreds of thousands more jobs across Canada than the auto industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334155">We also must remember that forestry jobs are good jobs. The average wage per employee was $46,300 in 2005. The national average per employee is $37,900. Each of these jobs creates an estimated four spin-off jobs. Most important, we have to remember that the forestry sector is an integral part of our identity and our economy and will require a collaborative effort from industry, labour and government, to create the conditions in which this sustainability can flourish and keep these important jobs in our communities for generations to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334156">In my riding I have seen many mill closures and others are just struggling to survive. We really need the government to step up to the plate and provide them the reasonable credit they need and also help them with regard to their energy needs because that is sinking them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334157">I could go on and on about forestry closures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334158"> The impact of EI in these communities certainly has been great as well. To keep workers there and hopefully find employment, while we look at the return of the forestry sector to what it needs to get to, we need to ensure we have changes to EI. That is fundamental to assist workers when they need it the most. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334159">I cannot tell members too often the importance of the spin-off effect on these jobs. Companies have told me that they will no longer be able to exist and that they will not be able to function properly or even start up again should they close. The government is not coming forward and assisting them. If we lose our forestry sector, the spin-off jobs will be detrimental, not only to Canada as a whole. The government has helped the auto industry, but who will buy cars if our people are unemployed? </ParaText>

They are hiding behind it and using it as an excuse to cover off the deliberate mistakes they made in forestry policy in the last Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334162">The Conservatives are now trying to present it as this is some kind of global problem, which they had no hand in. Yet when we debated the softwood lumber sellout, we saw how they gave up a billion dollars of our producers' money. Under clause 10 of the bill, they imposed on our industry a 15% export tax, which was higher than what the Americans were dinging us. Written into the bill were charges against companies that tried to do value added. Now we have lost markets and we have the Americans coming back at us. The government has crippled our industry.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334174">It is with great interest that I rise to speak here today on this Bloc Québécois opposition day to address an issue that is very important for Quebec, of course, and all of Canada. Naturally, I am referring to the forestry crisis we are seeing in many areas of Quebec, as well as the Conservative government's refusal to take action on the matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334175">The motion we moved here today denounces the Conservatives' failure to act in this file, and particularly the vastly inadequate measures included in the last budget. The motion also proposes to the government a series of measures to help the forestry industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334176">While the forestry crisis persists throughout Quebec, the Conservative government's recent budget revealed that it remains completely insensitive to the difficulties facing that industry and the communities that are affected. When will this government understand that its approach is simply unacceptable in the context of the current crisis and that it must immediately start listening to and working with forestry stakeholders to help this industry get though these tough times? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334177">The Quebec forestry industry accounts for nearly 88,000 jobs in various sawmills and pulp and paper plants, or about a third of all Canadian jobs in this sector. The economies of some 230 towns and villages in Quebec are heavily dependent on it, and 160 of them are totally dependent. The forestry industry is going through a severe downturn that poses a grave threat to many of these communities. Just between May 2002 and April 2005, more than 10,000 jobs were lost in the Quebec forestry industry. Since April 2005, the situation has only grown worse, with more than 21,000 job losses in the Quebec forestry industry and related areas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334178">Left to its own devices during the softwood lumber dispute, when the federal government refused to provide it with the loan guarantees it needed to stay afloat, the forestry industry was unable to face the mounting value of the Canadian dollar at the time. Forestry companies lost their competitive advantage on foreign markets, especially in the United States. Now the Quebec forestry industry has to deal with a U.S. economy that is slowing rapidly and is in crisis, resulting in a major reduction in timber sales and collapsing prices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334179">It may also be faced with surge in protectionist sentiment in the United States, which would further undermine sales south of the border. I recently attended the winter meeting of the National Governors Association in Washington. I had an opportunity to discuss some pressing issues, such as the trade in softwood lumber we are currently debating, with a number of U.S. governors and congressmen. We were told that some senators and governors from southern states were critical of U.S. imports of Canadian softwood lumber and were asking the American President “to take whatever action is necessary to fully address Canadian unfair trade practices in the softwood lumber sector”. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="05">(1205)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1334180">Even if these approaches to the American President are politically motivated, I think we need to be very vigilant. They show that there is a definite protectionist trend in the United States. As I was saying before, there is a major crisis in the forestry industry in Quebec and urgent action is needed at least to mitigate its effects. The government does not seem to understand this and is being negligent in providing assistance in its last budget that is not nearly enough, and I would even say, that is shameful and insulting. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334181">With the support of the Liberals, the Conservative government provided the forestry sector with no more than a mere $170 million in its last budget. That is a disgrace. At the same time it decided, with the support of the Liberals and the Conservative members from Quebec, to invest more than $2.7 billion to support the automobile industry in Ontario. We are not opposed to this, but we think that the Quebec forestry industry is just as important, and even more important in terms of jobs. In the opinion even of the Québec Forest Industry Council, the $170 million that was announced over two years is far from enough and hardly reflects the needs flowing from the crisis in the Quebec forestry industry. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334182">The Conservatives and the Liberals are showing their contempt for this industry which is the lifeblood for many Quebec regions. However, the Bloc Québécois is proposing a series of measures to support our forestry companies: loan guarantees for the purchase of more efficient production equipment; massive investments or tax measures to promote innovation; R and D for the industry; making the R and D tax credit refundable so that companies not turning a profit can innovate and develop new products. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334183">In addition, it is important to mention that none of these measures contravenes the softwood lumber agreement, no matter what the Conservative minister says. For weeks, the Bloc Québécois has been asking the government and its Quebec ministers which section of the softwood lumber agreement prevents the federal government from providing loans and loan guarantees to the Quebec forestry industry. This government does not have an answer and chooses to ignore us. No one in the government, including the <Affiliation DbId="128720" Type="4">Minister of State (Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec)</Affiliation> can quote the section in NAFTA or in the softwood lumber agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334184">Why? Because the agreement does not prohibit the use of loan guarantees. This position is shared by the Quebec Forest Industry Council and the Government of Quebec, which allowed Investissement Québec to provide guarantees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334185">The position of the Conservative government, including the Quebec MPs, only shows that it prefers to bow down to the U.S. protectionist lobbies that complain about the smallest initiative that will help the forestry sector. But above all, it proves that this government does not want to help Quebec's industry. During this time, what have Quebec Conservatives done? They have remained silent and have refused to stand up for Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334186">In closing, this motion addresses the needs of the forestry industry and the communities that are dependent on it. For that reason I am asking that all members, especially Quebec members, support this motion.</ParaText>

I agree with many of my colleague’s remarks about the subject. But we also notice that the government is suggesting that this is a new problem caused by the economic situation, when we know the industry has been struggling for two or three years or even longer.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334190"> In the 2007 budget that was approved by this House and Parliament, $4.6 billion was set aside by the government for investment in infrastructure, but it spent only $1 billion. This goes to show how little it cares about these problems. Does my colleague agree with me on this? </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334191">Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question. It is true the problem in the forestry industry has been with us for some years. It started in May 2002 and lasted through the fall of 2006.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334192">We still remember the softwood lumber crisis. Back then, we were asking the Liberal government for loan guarantees to support our industry. That is when we lost more than 10,000 jobs: between May 2002 and April 2005.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334193">The crisis began then, and has continued ever since. The government in Ottawa, which once had a huge surplus, is now in a crisis itself and is doing nothing to help the forestry industry.</ParaText>

Over 30 sawmills in British Columbia have closed. Thousands of people have lost their jobs and many of our communities are really suffering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334195"> One of the ironies of all of this is that at a time when people in the forestry industry in British Columbia are losing their jobs, there has been an increase in the export of raw logs, unfinished logs, out of the country. Instead of turning those logs into finished products of some kind, instead of manufacturing them into finished products in British Columbia and elsewhere in Canada, we are sending these raw logs out of the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334196">I wonder if, like me, the member believes that we should restrict or even ban the export of raw logs to ensure that Canadian workers get a chance for a job turning those raw logs into products here in Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334205">Madam Speaker, I will try not to get carried away during this debate, because I know our interpreters sometimes have a hard time translating what I say when I get carried away. I will try to stay calm, but this is a debate that quickly becomes emotional for me, because the Abitibi—Témiscamingue region has been hard hit by the softwood lumber crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334206">But first, Madam Speaker, I would like to congratulate you. I have not had the chance to speak in the House since you were appointed as deputy chair of committees of the whole, and for the time being, you are presiding over the work of the House. Congratulations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334207">That being said, I am extremely concerned about the softwood lumber situation. I will give some examples. I have a specific example of what is happening in our area. In 2006, we approached the Conservative government that had been elected. We will all recall that there was a softwood lumber crisis. At the time, when the softwood lumber agreement was signed, the NDP and the Liberals voted against it and we voted with the Conservatives to support the agreement. We supported the agreement for several reasons. First, because the workers, the employers and the municipalities asked us to, because otherwise they were all going to shut down. That is the nub of the problem. I may have the Minister’s answer, since he does not want to give an answer regarding the section that deals with the softwood lumber crisis and the reason why he does not want to give loan guarantees. We asked the government then and we are asking it again—we asked the Speaker and the Minister—to clarify the so-called anti-circumvention clause. I am going to speak a little on that subject.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334208">I know I have only 10 minutes, but this is an extremely important clause and it was so vague. We told the government: “Be careful, this absolutely has to be clarified with officials at Canada Economic Development and the Department of International Trade,” because they are going to come back to us and say: “The assistance works like this, it does not work like that, and you cannot do that.” Here is an example. In Barraute, in Abitibi-Témiscamingue, there is a company that manufactures wood box springs for beds. That company asked for assistance from the federal government and CED said: “Listen, it is not clear. We do not know whether you are going to be able to ship that to the American market. If you ship that to the American market, it comes under the anti-circumvention clause and it might violate the agreement.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334209"> That is the issue. The government absolutely has to help companies get through the crisis, and there are not a lot of ways of doing that, there is only one. These companies have to be given loan guarantees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334210">In my riding, there are Tembec, Abitibi Bowater, Kruger, Domtar and four independent companies. The first four I just named—I will repeat them: Domtar, Kruger, Abitibi Bowater and Tembec—are not doing well. They are actually on life support. We were expecting Abitibi Bowater to declare bankruptcy yesterday or today. That has not happened, luckily for us. But for us in Abitibi—Témiscamingue, this means more than 2,000 direct jobs. For a region with a population of 130,000, if we lose 2,000 direct jobs, plus another 4,000 indirect jobs, we have just shut down several villages. As it stands, Launay has shut down, Béarn has shut down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334211"> My colleague from Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik—Eeyou will be talking about Lebel-sur-Quévillon again. But in my riding, I have to say that Tembec is not doing well. They have asked the federal government for assistance. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1334212"> If the ministers on the other side could listen to me for 30 seconds—I am thinking about the <Affiliation DbId="128708" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation>,<Affiliation DbId="128720" Type="4"> the Minister of State for the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec</Affiliation> and especially the<Affiliation DbId="128690" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation>—if they could get together and understand that a situation like that is dangerous for our regions, then we would have made some progress. We might think they do not talk to one another. We might think that the ministers and departments find it very difficult to talk to one another.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334213"> I know this because we have worked with Tembec on applications to Canada Economic Development. CED told us it would help us, but Export Development Canada thinks that this would violate the softwood lumber agreement. That agreement has really hurt us. It was a negotiated agreement, but to use an expression from legal jargon, it was “with a gun to our head”. Sign it or you die. That is exactly what is happening now. We have proposed 15 measures that could be useful, and I am going to review a few of them for the benefit of my colleagues opposite.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334214">The forestry resource could generate more jobs. Recovery is an option. Some companies, such as Cyclofor, in my riding, need help. When Cyclofor goes to cut blocks, it recovers everything left in the cutting area to the level of about three 3 centimetres of sediment and chips the residue. What does it do with the chips? They are not selling anymore. It has to transform them into something else. It needs help with research and development to come up with new products and find new uses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334215"> I will not talk about stimulating the creation and development of new processing industries. This crisis may give some regions an opportunity to reassess and to change their tack. The forest is like a ship, and needs to change tack significantly in order to change the focus of its production. We must stop exporting 2x4s. This expression is understood in the forestry industry. At the moment, 2x4s are shipped out. Houses built there are transformed, and often the 2x4s leave Abitibi-Témiscamingue, head off to Toronto, cross over at Detroit and come back to be sold to us. This is unacceptable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334216">Our motion today encourages the government to do its homework. New product research and development must be stimulated. How? Personally, I sent three proposals to Canada Economic Development, for example. One department is not doing its job, and it is the Department of the Environment. That department could help the forestry industry hugely by assisting research on producing ethanol from forestry residues. Instead of making ethanol from corn, it could be made from forestry residue. The mills are there. The people are there who can work their way out of this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334217"> I have another example. There is talk of establishing pellet mills, processing tiny bits of wood into the fuel used in slow-burning wood stoves. Pellets can be used in place of wood. One example is Écoflamme in Témiscamingue. Tembec has its head office there. If it fails, some 500 jobs will be lost and everything around it will close. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334218"> We are in a crisis. I will close by asking the government to be sensitive and concerned about the affected regions and to think about helping them. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334239">This crisis is nothing new, as we all know. There has been a crisis in the Quebec forestry industry for a number of years, as can easily be seen by the general context. First there was the Coulombe report, which recommended a 20% reduction in the allowable cut. Then there was the chief forester, who basically confirmed this and even imposed more in percentage terms for certain regions and species. A northern limit was also imposed. In addition, there have been the anti-forestry campaigns of Greenpeace and other groups. We have also had all the losses due to the pine beetle in western Canada and the spruce budworm.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334240">There were a lot of other factors as well, including the changes in the value of the Canadian dollar, the cost of energy, corporate mergers, and the falling prices of wood and paper. These have not all been under the control of a single government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334241">The current problem with plant closures is linked to market conditions. No company ever closed down plants because they were selling too much. The problem we are facing now has to do with the markets where we sell our products. Ninety-six percent of the softwood lumber exported by Quebec goes to the United States. Eighty-three percent of Canadian lumber goes to the United States. More than a million houses are now up for sale in the United States, and it is easy to see what the impact is on our forestry industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334242">Considering all these factors, one understands why, since it was elected in 2006, our Conservative government has adopted a series of measures to support forestry workers. The government’s actions since we came into office must be looked at as a whole, and particularly within our limits for intervention, since the largest part of the forestry sector comes under provincial jurisdiction. Our possible areas of intervention include secondary and tertiary processing, innovative projects—research was mentioned earlier—and the development of new markets, which is essential. Everyone in this House knows that but ignores it when it comes time to assign blame.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334243">Even before tabling Canada’s economic action plan, on January 27, our Conservative government had settled the softwood lumber dispute, which produced $5 billion for the forestry industry, including $1 billion for Quebec, while at the same time ensuring stability for the workers who depend on this sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334244">We also took other measures, while respecting the agreement with our American partners. We reduced the fiscal burden on Canadians by $200 billion. We established the community development trust with funding of $1 billion, of which $217 million was allocated for Quebec. We invested $72 million in targeted support for older workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334245">In the 2008 budget we added another $90 million and in our economic action plan, we provided an additional $60 million for older workers. We set aside $127 million for innovation and development of new markets. We know how valuable innovation and new markets are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334246">In our January 27 economic action plan, we added $170 million in support for innovative projects and development of new markets. We have established a $1 billion community adjustment fund to assist communities affected by the economic crisis, and more than $200 million of that will go to Quebec. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1334247">That, of course, includes forestry communities that are seeking to diversify their economies and to offer new work opportunities for young people living in those areas. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334248">We have also introduced a green infrastructure fund, which includes forestry biomass and new energy sources, and measures to encourage renovation and construction that should stimulate the demand for lumber.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334249">I am also very proud that our plan responds to the immediate needs of workers and communities. We have targeted an amount of $8.3 billion to help Canadian workers, through improved employment insurance benefits and increased access to training. For example, we have provided an additional $500 million for claimants in long-term training programs. We are also extending work sharing agreements by 14 weeks to a new maximum of 52 weeks. This program is very popular and much appreciated at this time in all regions of Quebec and the entire country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334250">In addition to freezing employment insurance premiums, we have extended the eligibility period by five weeks to help workers who have lost their jobs over a long period. Our economic action plan also provides more money to help companies through Export Development Canada, which works with some 90% of the forestry companies in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334251">Mr. Avrim Lzar, president and CEO of the Forest Products Association of Canada, in other words for the entire country, had this to say about the budget: </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334252">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left">“The government has clearly heard the message and embraced our vision of becoming the producers of the best quality, most innovative and greenest forest products in the world. And it understands that in order to get there Canada needs to attract investment and secure the jobs of nearly 300,000 skilled Canadians forest workers and the communities they work in... We are very encouraged by the budget measures aimed at ensuring access to credit for Canadian businesses, particularly the expansion of the powers and financing authorities of the EDC, and we look forward to working with the government to determine how these measures can help our companies and workers . </QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334253">I would remind hon. members that Mr. Lazar represents a large number of Canadian forestry companies, including AbitibiBowater, Canfor, Kruger, Louisiana-Pacific Canada, Tembec, Weyerhaeuser Company, to name but a few. If anyone wonders how important Mr. Lazar is in the world of Canadian forestry products, he is the head of the largest Canadian association.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334254">So we have proof that it is as false as false can be to claim that the government has not done all it could in this sad situation. What is more, it must be noted that the arbitration ruling on softwood lumber has just been brought down, on February 26, and requires Canada, the provinces and the forestry companies to pay $68 million in penalties, and this is a ruling that cannot be appealed. This ought to serve as a reminder of how cautious we need to be when dealing with the forestry industry as well as a reminder of the softwood lumber agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334255">So we must keep in mind that caution is of the essence. Mr. Lazar has also said: —the government cannot do much without the risk of creating new problems at the border”. In his opinion, any direct aid following the model of the assistance given to the auto industry might jeopardize the industry's access to the US market, and that must be avoided at all cost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334256">I would add one more thing: the forestry sector is, of course, the industries, but it is more than that. It is a natural resource. It is workers, independent contractors, loggers, truckers, and many other people who are often our friends or family members. We are working every day to find better solutions to help those families, and we will continue to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334257">I would like to end with a reminder of something that is of the utmost importance. The Bloc and its allies have chosen to play petty politics at the expense of the workers. That is their choice. I will not play their game, because I feel it is more appropriate to work with people who are looking for solutions to the world economic difficulties that are having repercussions here. I am in favour of bringing people together, not dividing them. </ParaText>

My question is specifically about first nations communities in British Columbia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334275">There are 103 first nations communities within the pine beetle devastation area. These communities are very concerned about their ongoing safety. They are concerned about the forest fire danger to their communities. They have been waiting for federal government money to be transferred to the province of British Columbia to assist them in planning around the forest fire danger, setting up firebreaks around their communities, planning evacuations, and all those kinds of things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334276">Unfortunately, the province has not received the money from the federal government yet to do that. It has made pitches directly to the federal government for that funding, for $20 million to start that work immediately, and $5 million for ongoing work. These are communities that are concerned about their very existence should forest fires break out in this pine beetle devastation area.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1334281">Madam Speaker, it is an honour to take part in today's debate on the forestry industry. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334282">It reminds me of the fact that my father started off as a timber scaler. He received his training in Sainte-Croix, near Quebec City. He was said to be very good at flipping the famous 2x4s over to assess their quality. He even worked at the Union catholique des cultivateurs for a wood producers union. As we can see, the forestry industry is linked not only to my family history but to Quebec's history, and that it is deeply rooted in our province. The forestry industry is a renewable resource. We are surrounded with objects made of wood in this chamber. We want efforts to be made to reintroduce wood in major construction works, so as to pass on this desire to future generations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334283">As the member of Parliament for Lévis—Bellechasse, I have in my riding, and particularly in the county of Les Etchemins, many forestry companies. I think of Rotobec, an export and manufacturing company — products are imported from around the world. I also think of the Audet sawmill, Bois Carvin, and a company from Lévis which was taken under the umbrella of the Ag-Bio Centre, a business incubator that received subsidies from the Economic Development Agency, and developed a biopesticide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334284">The forestry industry is a pillar of our economy. I have statistics here from the Quebec Forestry Industry Council. In Quebec alone, the economic activity is estimated at $12.9 billion, with nearly $4 billion going to wages and $1 billion going back to our governments. The forestry industry is profitable for governments, and it is in our interest to ensure that it does well. Across Canada, we are talking about close to 300,000 direct jobs and 450,000 indirect ones. This goes to show how important the forestry industry, an industry facing admittedly major challenges, is to our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334285">In Quebec, because we export so much to the United States, a one-cent difference in the exchange rate can result in $100 million in losses to the industry in energy costs. This industry has been mismanaged over the past few years. Among other factors, there is the cost of the raw materials, whether they come from public or private forests. Several factors have combined to make our forestry industry vulnerable to plant closures—one in six in Quebec—and job losses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334286">Even if all Quebec companies together did $13 billion worth of business, they still would not be among the 10 largest companies. There has been some consolidation. A major global phenomenon is happening, and we want to stand by our forestry industry and help it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334287">I would like to cite one last statistic. Seventy-five per cent of the softwood fibre harvested is used to make lumber or newsprint. Demand for these products is declining, and they are among the least value-added forestry products. Today, I agree with those of my colleagues in the House who have said that it is important to invest in innovation and research, to create new sectors so that our forestry industry can find a niche where it can perform well. I wanted to paint a picture of this extremely important industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334288">I would now like to turn to the measures we have included in our economic action plan to support the forestry industry through this crisis. As my hon. colleague, the <Affiliation DbId="128720" Type="4">Minister of State for the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec</Affiliation> just explained, we will continue working with the forestry industry to help it get through this crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334289">This is a market problem, due in part to the problems our American ally is going through, but it is also a credit problem. We want to work closely with the industry, and that is what we are doing, to help it maintain liquidity so that it can keep making high-quality forest products and stay competitive on the world market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334290">Access to credit is not only key for the forestry industry, but also for all manufacturing sectors, be it mining or other Canadian companies. That is why the economic action plan is providing $200 billion for companies, all industrial sectors and families: to help them and ensure that our companies can access cash.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1334291">The $200 billion in the economic action plan has been approved. It was approved here last week with the support of my colleagues, those from other provinces and the support of my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128396" Type="2">Saint Boniface</Affiliation> as well as the member for <Affiliation DbId="128640" Type="2">Roberval—Lac-Saint-Jean</Affiliation>. These measures are in place, and we hope to get them off the ground to support our industry, in particular our forestry industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334292">We also want to create demand. We know that there is a problem and that there is not much demand. We want to increase demand by improving Canada's building inventory and by stimulating investments in home renovations. That is why we have set aside $7.8 billion. Perhaps there is someone at home listening today who wants to renovate, invest $10,000, replace windows or finish a basement. All of these projects require wood. The government can give him up to $1,350 to encourage him to modernize and protect his assets. That will increase the demand for wood. If only one person does it, that is not much, but if there is $7.8 billion for the entire country, it means that many households can do something to stimulate our forestry industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334293">As my colleague, the minister and member for <Affiliation DbId="128640" Type="2">Roberval—Lac-Saint-Jean</Affiliation>, said a moment ago, we are working closely with aboriginal communities in Quebec and everywhere in Canada. There will be $400 million injected to improve housing. We know this is a major need. That too will be grist for our mill, our paper mills, as is obviously the case, and we will stimulate demand on that side. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334294">In the economic action plan, we are investing nearly $12 billion in our infrastructures, and we hope that this will generate economic activity that will help our forestry sector. Certainly the measures proposed in the economic action plan lay a solid foundation to help our forestry product and mining sectors, and the communities that depend on them. In spite of all the measures we put in place in Canada, with the decline in demand in the United States, there may be setbacks, and that is why, in a time of economic upheaval, we have proposed measures for communities and workers, for heads of household who are directly affected by the crisis. We have instituted an older worker adjustment and community adjustment program. We have also implemented measures to promote innovation, develop markets, provide access to credit, as I mentioned, and provide tax relief.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334295">To come back to the measure for communities, that is $1 billion. We hear the opposition saying there is only $170 million for forestry. If that money is invested well, it can help our forestry sector, but that is just one of the measures we have implemented. Those other measures include the $1 billion for communities. That money will go primarily to the forestry sector and other sectors affected by the economic upheaval. This means that $1 billion will be injected into communities that are vulnerable because of the situation we are experiencing. Those measures will help our workers make the transition, preserve their ability to keep working and, as they say, put bread on the table. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334296"> I referred to $170 million. That is the amount to be spent on innovation. We are talking about it a lot today because that is how we hope to help our forestry sector stimulate its industry. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334297"> I would also mention that nearly $440 million will be available to enable our forestry industries to invest. In the late 1970s, the forestry industry invested and that is what allowed it to make a significant recovery. In the 1980s, the paper mills also invested in treating their waste water, and that is entirely to their credit. They are good corporate citizens that got their emissions under control. So we are stimulating them and creating a favourable situation for them to be able to invest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334298"> I also want to say that we will be supporting workers with an $8.3 billion program to help them stay in the work force, whether in the company or once they have left the company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334299">We will continue to support the forestry sector. On this side of the House, we will continue to look for solutions, working with our partners and with industry, so that our industry comes out of this crisis in a better position in global terms. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334300">Madam Speaker, I listened carefully to my colleague's speech and found it very interesting. But he forgot to talk about one thing. Forestry companies are laying off workers and closing plants. Workers who have lost their jobs are therefore going on employment insurance. The Bloc Québécois asked the government to eliminate the two-week period during which people have to wait to receive their first cheque. Here in Canada, we are poor relations because we still have a waiting period. France has none. There, as soon as workers are laid off, they get their first cheque, with no waiting period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334301">I would like to hear what my colleague has to say about that. What does he think about the Bloc Québécois recommendation to eliminate the two-week waiting period and the fact that we have a new bill that would enable people to immediately receive employment insurance, which they paid into?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334303">Since we are talking about the forestry industry, sometimes we have to look not only at the trees, but at the whole forest. Last week, my colleague had the opportunity to support the whole forest in Quebec, because a number of measures were put forward to help workers, such as the work sharing measure we proposed. We want to keep forestry workers working. When companies decide to reduce their workforce, the work sharing period is extended. We are also extending the benefit period by five weeks. My colleague had the chance to support these measures, but unfortunately, he remained seated. I am happy I stood up to support these measures. We are talking about several hundred million dollars for worker training. My colleague had the chance to support a whole range of measures last week. Fortunately, we on this side of the House supported them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334304">Madam Speaker, I listened with much interest to my colleague saying that this forestry industry crisis originated elsewhere in the world. According to him, it has nothing to do with the government policy. But everyone knows that this forestry industry crisis is a result of the softwood sellout agreement that the government signed. This morning, we heard witnesses saying that, in addition to the $68 million that Quebec and Ontario have to pay, due to the decision made last week, it is expected that the next decision will cost Canadian taxpayers between 400 million and one billion dollars due to all these problems.</ParaText>

We support the forestry industry. We supported it in the first month after we came to power, in 2006, and we will continue to support it.</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That, in the opinion of the House, by providing only $170 million in funding over two years in the latest budget to assist the forestry industry, the government is showing once again its lack of concern for the Quebec economy, which has been hard hit by the forestry crisis, since this amount falls well short of what this industry needs to see it through the current crisis, especially since this funding will serve to extend programs that are ill-suited to the needs of the industry in crisis; the government should therefore establish a real plan as soon as possible to help the forestry industry, a plan including a series of specific, sustainable development measures, including loans and loan guarantees, refundable tax credits for research and development, a policy to encourage the use of lumber in the construction and renovation of federal public buildings and measures to support energy and ethanol production from forestry waste.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334315">The Bloc Québécois motion is intended to be complete in itself. Our colleagues in the other parties should follow the Bloc's example. Quebec is a diversified society in a number of the sectors of its economy. One of the major sectors is the forestry industry. My riding of Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel has one of the highest concentrations of hardwood forests in North America. We need to keep abreast of developments in the hardwood forestry industry. In times of economic crisis, that industry faces a rather difficult situation. According to this morning's, <I>Le Droit</I>, one of our companies has just had to apply for protection under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act because of the weakness of the market. The newspaper was referring to a hardwood floor company in difficulty that has a number of employees. In the Papineau sector of my riding of Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, 45% of jobs are connected to the forestry sector. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334316">If I chose any other riding in the regions of Quebec, the figures would be more or less the same, that is somewhere between 25% and 55% of the labour force is connected to the forestry sector. The same goes for other provinces in Canada. Every day, the Bloc rises in this House to defend the interests of Quebeckers, but we are glad when it also helps other regions of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334317">One cannot remain unmoved by this crisis, which started long before the financial crisis announced in 2008. It is more than five years since the forestry industry started to ring the alarm bells and to warn the government. We had the softwood lumber crisis and the agreement with the US, which the Bloc Québécois supported precisely because the Quebec forestry industry asked it to. The industrial sector was unanimous on this. The NDP often accuses us of all manner of things in this area, but the Bloc Québécois has always been in symbiosis with those industries. It is all very well to live in a dream world, like the NDP, but there is a hard reality: people are losing their jobs. Business owners are saying they would rather lose a billion dollars than to risk losing it all. That is the choice business made at the time, and we endorsed that choice. That is what it means to be a political party that listens to business and its needs. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1334318">This is why we are proposing this motion today. We are still listening to business. The industry has been asking for loans and loan guarantees for several years, not several months. It has been done for the auto industry, but this government is refusing to do it for the forest and manufacturing sectors although it is allowed by international law. This is the reality. Why? Because in a time of crisis, it is rather difficult to obtain financing from the banks. This is the reality. Forestry companies have been in a crisis situation for many years. Even in budget 2008, <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">the Minister of Finance</Affiliation> had identified the forestry and manufacturing sectors as simply being in recession. They were already in recession then. Signs were present well before the financial crisis became evident in 2008. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334319">Obviously, when a whole segment of the economy is suffering both in Québec and in other Canadian provinces, it is impossible for us not to be on the lookout and not to try to listen. The Conservatives have proposed a stimulus package with only $170 million for this sector. This is just peanuts. Excuse me for saying this, but compared to companies' needs, this is close to nothing. This is why we are today asking the government to open their eyes. We need a true plan to help the forestry industry. There is a package for the auto industry. We are not criticizing this plan, quite the opposite. What we wanted in the stimulus package for the auto industry was protection for subcontractors because many of them are in Québec as well as other parts of Canada. We were hoping the plan would have a clause to prevent manufacturers from subcontracting outside of Canada and outside of Québec, but once more, the Conservatives did not listen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334320">The Conservatives made a choice by tabling a budget that provides only $170 million for the forestry sector. As hon. members can well imagine, for that reason alone the Bloc Québécois could not support this budget, because we cannot abandon workers in this sector. For example, in my riding, in the Papineau area, 45% of all jobs are in the forestry sector. We simply cannot ignore that industry. As I said, the same is true in all regions of Quebec. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334321">Today, we are proposing loans, loan guarantees and refundable tax credits for research and development. We are not talking about mere tax credits for research and development. In order to get tax credits, one must first pay taxes. However, when companies are going through crises and cannot finance themselves, they are definitely not making profits. If that were the case, they would have no problems finding money. This means that if we only give them tax credits, these companies will not be able to benefit from them. Instead, we are asking for refundable tax credits. If a business has not made profits but is investing, then it would get a cheque from Ottawa. This would also help that company make investments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334322">We are asking for a policy to encourage the use of lumber in the construction and renovation of federal public buildings. This makes sense. Canada is one of the world's largest producers of lumber. It would only make sense if, in the federal buildings, some of the construction projects would involve the use of lumber. Finally, we are asking for measures to support energy and ethanol production from forestry waste, or biomass. Now is the time to do that. If we want to help these companies, we must invest. One way of diversifying their activities would be to use biomass to produce energy. This could help them increase their production.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334323">Again, if Conservative, Liberal and New Democrat members were aware of what Quebeckers are going through, they would support the motion brought forward by the Bloc Québécois.</ParaText>

However, in Mr. Chevrette's testimony before the committee at the end of August, he explained that the industry in Quebec is currently being wiped out by this Conservative government.

              <ParaText id="1334330">First of all, I am pleased that the NDP has decided to support the Bloc Québécois motion. It will now stop living in the past. The problem is that the NDP members are always living in the past. in this case the Bloc Québécois is not to blame. An entire industry and not just one man—Guy Chevrette or whoever—wanted the agreement. The entire Quebec industry wanted it. In fact, not just the Quebec industry, but the Canadian industry as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334331">As I mentioned, we can always go back over the past but in these international debates, the pattern never changes. The Americans know very well that by the time the winners lose they will all be dead. That is what will happen and what they are doing. They know very well that in the end Canada will win. However, they are sucking the life out of the industry. For that reason we must have loan guarantees. That is the reality. No matter what Americans may think, let us get going and help our companies. If we can support our industries and get them through this crisis, the winners will triumph in two ways: they will have weathered the crisis and they will have money in their pockets. In addition, there will be a nice surplus allowing them to increase employees' wages. Perhaps the NDP should step into 2009 and stop living in the past.<I /></ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334334">): Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to rise today in the House to speak about the forestry industry. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334335">Many years ago, Trois-Rivières was the world capital of paper, and there are still many jobs in the paper mills, which are currently in such difficulty. The Mauricie in general has very large numbers of people who work in the forestry industry. An entire segment of our industrial base is redefining itself and trying to find new niches and novel ways of doing things. That is the main reason why we are proposing this motion today in support of this industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334336">It is going through very difficult times. The recent economic and financial crisis has only aggravated a situation that was already very alarming and that the Bloc Québécois has been condemning and debating in the House for years. We certainly must condemn this laissez-faire policy, which prevents us from providing adequate support to this important part of the Quebec economy. In providing only $170 million over two years in its last budget, Ottawa has flatly turned its back on the entire forestry industry, with the connivance of the Liberal Party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334337">Over the years, the Bloc Québécois has brought forward a number of ideas to deal with the crisis. For reasons that are often unfortunately purely partisan or ideological, our proposals were ignored, to the detriment of Quebec and its regions. We have suggested a number of specific measures, including loans, loan guarantees, refundable tax credits for research and development, policies to encourage the use of wood in the construction and renovation of federal public buildings, and measures to support the production of energy using ethanol and forestry waste. All these measures should help the industry emerge from a crisis that has lasted too long and should ensure sustainable, viable, profitable development for all the Quebec economy and Quebec society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334338">I want to say a bit more about these loans and loan guarantees. Ottawa refused to help the forestry industry during the entire softwood lumber crisis. It thereby prevented the industry from modernizing its means of production and improving its productivity. The industry was unable to invest in new equipment and in the development of new products. These investments are necessary, though, for the very survival of the industry. So now the forestry companies are left without resources, totally unable to make the necessary investments. It is all especially obvious in our region of the Mauricie.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334339">Yesterday, Monday, workers in total support of our demands demonstrated in favour of loan guarantees for the industry. AbitibiBowater—the Laurentian plant in Grand-Mère—is asking for special measures to guarantee loans to the forestry industry by the end of March. Last year, the company renewed loans worth $350 million. Since then, the market has been in trouble, as everyone knows, and demand has shrunk significantly. That is why the employees found themselves out on the street. If loan guarantees were given to this industry, we could keep our workers on the job. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334340">In the St. Maurice Region, the Smurfit-Stone plant in La Tuque applied for protection under Quebec financial legislation. Now we have another 250 employees in the street. This is very disturbing. In the case of AbitibiBowater in Quebec, there are 7,600 employees and 8,900 retirees. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334341"> As we can see, therefore, the Bloc's motion today hits the nail on the head in terms of workers' concerns. These investments are important. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334342"> Respecting the trade agreement on softwood lumber with the United States was not easy. It was a necessary evil. The government must now, in the wake of the difficulties created by the agreement, help the industry with loans and loan guarantees. It has to support the industry. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1334343">This form of assistance, I might point out, is in compliance with the softwood lumber agreement and with NAFTA. The government keeps saying that it can do nothing and is bound by the agreement. We do not think that is the case. We are still awaiting an answer from the member for <Affiliation DbId="128640" Type="2">Roberval—Lac-Saint-Jean</Affiliation> on the number of the section preventing such forms of assistance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334344">Right now, the forestry industry is considered high risk by the bankers. This industry therefore pays a high risk premium when it turns to the financial institutions. The result is that a number of them are unable to get funding. This is why the federal government must guarantee loans. In almost all cases, this measure costs next to nothing. It is not a subsidy. The company repays the money at term. So it is hard to understand the government's refusal to act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334345">According to the Quebec Forestry Industry Council, if the government guaranteed the loans by the banks to the forestry industry, the rates of interest would be more reasonable, and new projects might even be undertaken. For this reason, the Bloc Québécois, the sole defender of the Quebec forestry industry in Ottawa, is presenting this motion to correct the errors of both the Liberals and the Conservatives and to have the federal government grant loans and loan guarantees to the businesses hit so hard by the crisis in the manufacturing sector and for so many years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334346">Let us now talk about the second measure proposed in this motion, namely refundable tax credits for research and development. Research, innovation and development are the pillars on which an industry shapes its future. Increasing productivity, discovering new products and accessing new markets are critical to the development and survival of the Quebec and Canadian forestry industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334347">During a crisis such as the one that the forestry sector is experiencing, the industry cannot be left to fend for itself. That is why, in our stimulus package, in our motion today, and in fact since the beginning of the crisis, the Bloc Québécois has been proposing refundable tax credits for the forestry industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334348">I want to say a few words on measures to support energy and ethanol production from forestry waste. All the governments have come to realize that in order to find our way out of the crisis—as we can see in the United States—we must not only intervene in the economy, we must also help and fund tomorrow's economy, so that it will create jobs and opportunities for the future. The U.S. administration understands that and is investing in green and renewable energies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334349">Producing energy and ethanol from forestry waste is a perfect example of a traditional economy trying to develop new markets. For example, the Mauricie is one of four regions in Quebec that have been selected for calls to tenders to use forestry biomass to gradually replace fossil fuel. I should also mention that, as early as in 2010, the Amqui hospital centre, in Quebec's Matapédia Valley, is going to be heated with forestry biomass. It will be the first facility to do so in eastern Quebec. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334350">In the Mauricie region, and elsewhere, we have reconciled the economy and the environment. Using that approach allows us to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, diversify opportunities for our forestry industry, and make our region wealthier. Implementing measures to support energy and ethanol production from forestry waste would help diversify markets for forestry companies, revitalize regional economies that depend on this resource, reduce our dependency on oil, lower our energy costs, and give our entrepreneurs the help they really need in their plans for the future. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334351">In conclusion, we must realize that the moneys committed to the Conservative trust in 2008 are inadequate. The distribution of the money from that trust between the provinces is unfair. Quebec is getting $2,300 for each job lost, while Alberta is receiving $25,000. Let us not forget that 40% of all communities that depend on the forestry sector are located in Quebec. That is why I am urging hon. members to support this motion presented by the Bloc Québécois. The solutions that it proposes will help this important industry in all of Quebec.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334352">Madam Speaker, I agree with a lot of what my colleague had to say in her speech. The forestry industry has been a disaster over the last number of years. Approximately 20,000 jobs have been lost and I do not see anything being done in the House. This did not start with the recession. It started three or four years ago with the softwood lumber agreement, which was a major disappointment. It provided $1 billion to the American competition to fight us and that will probably be used for the next 10 years. I see us being shut out of that market or our capacity diminished greatly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334353">The member talked about the $1 billion community development trust fund. I analyzed that and I did not see any conditions or strings attached to it that indicate it would help any forestry worker or any town that was affected by the downturn in the forestry industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334354">Since it looks like we will have difficulty in the American market right now, does the hon. member see any new markets that Canada should be exploring on this issue?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334355">Madam Speaker, certainly new markets could be explored, and that is why we are calling for loan guarantees and loans for our companies to do research and development, which will help them to stabilize. As well, when we talk about the 2009 budget and the $170 million granted for the forestry sector, we can only lament the low priority the government is giving it, when we know that $2.7 billion is being given to the auto industry in Ontario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334356"> We have to understand that the auto industry represents 500,000 workers, but the forestry industry represents 825,000 workers. We can see that their priorities are misplaced. We can see that when the government created this trust fund and this assistance for communities, it allocated the money unfairly. </ParaText>

Usually, what she says makes sense, but today, it makes somewhat less sense. It is the decision by the Bloc to support this sellout agreement of the Conservative Party’s that brought about the disaster in Quebec’s forestry industry. Several thousand Quebeckers have lost their jobs, and now they are begging the Bloc to reverse its position. Why? It is simple. The anti-circumvention clause is now so broad that the Americans will challenge any decision made in Quebec or elsewhere in Canada to assist the forestry industry. Loan guarantees would provoke a reaction from the Americans, and it would be coming out of Quebeckers’ pockets again: $68 million last week, and another $400 million to come.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334361">What we have to understand is that the softwood lumber agreement is behind us. The industry strongly recommended and asked that we support that agreement, because people were genuinely going hungry. Certainly battling the Americans is like David and Goliath, and the solutions are indeed not very simple. That is why we have to look ahead now. We have to look at where this industry is going and what we can do to support it. We have neglected it for too long. Certainly, in our opinion, loan guarantees are the essential element of all the measures we are suggesting in this motion. I was pleased to hear just now that the NDP will nonetheless be supporting the motion. There is a desire to support the forestry industry, and that is a very good thing. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334362">Madam Speaker, it is an honour to stand in the House today to discuss this very important issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334363">Coming from the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, forestry certainly plays a great role. In my hometown of Bishop's Falls, which is in the Exploits Valley next to Grand Falls—Windsor, the major centre, forestry has played an essential role for my family, as well as others in my community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334364">Over the years, whether it be through the sawmills, the newsprint industry itself or the lumberyards, forestry has been an essential component to the economy of the area I represent, which is so rich in its natural resources. Yes, we do have the fisheries as one of our mainstays, and it has been described as the backbone of the economy of the outport of Newfoundland and Labrador, but forestry has played a role in that as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334365">I will comment on the history, where we have been and eventually explore where we are going in a few moments but first I will discuss the motion that was introduced by my hon. colleague from the Bloc. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334366">The opposition day motion states:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334367">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That, in the opinion of the House, by providing only $170 million in funding over two years in the latest budget to assist the forestry industry, the government is showing once again its lack of concern for the Quebec economy, which has been hard hit by the forestry crisis.... </QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334368">To a great extent, I understand where the Bloc members are coming from and I understand the gist of what they are saying but it leaves a lot of the more vulnerable people in the forest industry out there. It leaves them sort of tethered to hopes that have been vanquished in recent years because of the economy and because of the industry itself. Even before the recession that we have slid into, there were always problems with the newsprint industry with the onslaught of modern communications and technology advances being what they are. Obviously, this has been become a key issue for the entire industry, and not just for Quebec in this particular situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334369">I understand this is a major issue in Quebec and, on a per capita basis, there certainly is a greater dollar value than probably any other jurisdiction in North America. However, it also reflects on the entire nation and the entire continent of North America.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334370">I have mentioned before in this House the fact that we have a closure upon us in the town of Grand Falls—Windsor that will affect the bottom line of the entire province given that its output was so great. That mill was owned by AbitibiBowater. It decided a few months back to close the mill after 100 years of existence. We can all imagine how important this is. It will put close to 1,000 people, including loggers, mill workers and the stevedores in the town of Botwood, out of work. This will have a lasting impact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334371">That is the major reason I am talking about this issue today but I also wanted to reflect upon why we are here, which is to voice the concerns of our constituents in the case of this particular industry. I do believe the government has a great role to play in this industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334372">Moving along on this particular motion, it also talks about a plan for certain areas in which it hopes the government will invest, which would certainly be of benefit to the region. However, the question now becomes whether it goes as far as it should and, personally, I do not think it does.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334373">The Bloc motion does put forward some particular measures that I feel are very important, such as the sustainable development measures. We are dealing with a renewable resource, one that has anchored many communities in rural Canada for the last 100, 200, 300 years. Some communities were built upon it. Communities exist today because of it and will continue to proceed whether they have a large newsprint mill, a paper production mill or an integrated lumberyard. Opportunities still exist for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334374">However, the government has a role to play here and one that I believe is key. I do not want to divide this debate into what is a bailout as opposed to an investment. That is where we come in. Where the two sides of the House may differ on this argument is on exactly what they consider to be a bailout. There is always the connotation in a bailout that it is some kind of a waste of government money. I do not know whether that is true or not. I do not think we as politicians sit down and weigh the pros and cons of each particular investment to the point where we decide whether it is good or not for our constituencies.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1334375">The other thing the Bloc motion talked about was the refundable tax credits for research and development, which is absolutely key. A wood product has so much value and so many areas go untouched, areas that provide so much potential for all these communities, not just for the particular companies or individuals who own sawmills or lumberyards, but for the entire community itself. We are talking about year-round employment that provides a great deal of income for families to sustain larger families. We all know the traditions by which paper towns grew up. The children of many of the people who have great jobs in mills also get the same jobs and so on and so forth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334376">The mill in my riding has been around for 100 years and, as I mentioned earlier, it sustained my family and my neighbour's family. This is why we are here to talk about this important issue. I applaud the initiative that is coming from the Bloc and just how important this is. However, I would caution the Bloc members to expand it beyond just one particular jurisdiction. I hope they will address that in the next little while.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334377">The motion also calls for a policy to encourage the use of lumber in the construction and renovation of federal public buildings and measures to support energy and ethanol production from forestry waste. That is a very good idea and a good option at hand that we do not talk about too much.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334378">However, it is not just about the construction of buildings. I will give the House a fine example. In Europe right now there is a tremendous market for wood pellets as a source of energy and heat. This is one area, at least in my area of the country, that we have not explored to its fullest. When we think about it, with energy costs rising, wood pellets provide a cheaper alternative, depending, of course, on the price of the product one is buying, the actual wood pellets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334379">Therefore, the industry of developing, marketing and the production of wood pellets needs to evolve and mature to a place where we can provide a low cost product when it comes to energy. That is a good example where government can play a huge role. It could give subsidies to the individual consumer, which the provincial government did recently, but also incentives for the industry to basically make a greater profit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334380">One of the ways the industry can do that is for the government to be a good valued customer for wood pellets. It is possible not only in federal government buildings but some of the incentives that the government talks about when it comes to home renovations. This could be used, I hope, for this particular scenario. It is environmentally sustainable and it is a renewable resource. I hope the federal government as well as the provincial governments across the country will look at this as a good opportunity for economic development. That is one example that this particular industry can lend itself toward not only creating jobs but also reducing energy costs for the individual and for industry itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334381">I would like to talk briefly on the history of the forest industry in my province. A lot of this will parallel many of the other situations across the country on just how the forest industry has evolved to create such great value added products. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334382">For the first 400 years after the discovery of Newfoundland and Labrador, the forest was used almost exclusively as a support for the fishery. It became this tertiary activity to support a much larger effort. In addition to the construction of premises, wood was essential for fuel. It was then and it is today. It was also used for boat building, the construction of stages and flakes that, 400 years ago, were so essential.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334383">We will find that a lot of communities, as I stressed earlier, were based upon their ability to take the wood from the forest and turn it into something else for the value of other industries. That is essentially what we havecome down to. The industries in my area, all over the province and all over Atlantic Canada still take full advantage of that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334384">By the mid-1800s, it was apparent that the fishing industry could not support the population entirely. Therefore, to assist in diversifying the economy and developing the forest and mineral resources of the interior of Newfoundland, a railway was constructed across the island. The trans-island railway was completed in 1898 and it had two major influences on the province. One was access to the interior and two was the 145 blocks of land comprising nearly 4,000 square miles granted to the reconstruction railway. However, it also allowed interior regions of my province, much like others, to develop the forest industry 100 to 150 years ago. That was an essential component to the development of a lot of our economies.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1334385">That is the historical impact of the forest industry. I know we have debated this issue so much because it means so much to us. It is not just a rural component or issue. This also helps develop the cities in which we live and the entire economy itself. A tremendous amount of workers across the country rely on the forest industry and, in many cases, they get unheralded. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334386">I do not mean to take away from other industries that are also lining up for stimulus money and for investments from the government to allow their industry to flourish, and I speak of the auto sector and agriculture. However, the forest industry, with its historical context alone, should tell us that this should always be at the forefront. On every agenda, whether it is a federal agenda, a provincial agenda or a municipal agenda, forestry should always be in that front part. There is so much value added into these products and we have so much to gain from this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334387"> I commend the people from all parties who have spoken already on this. They truly know the importance of this industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334388">Up until the early 1900s, it was not considered necessary to protect the forest resource. I guess it is one of those things that maybe has suffered from neglect because the debate was always about other industries and forestry was sort of just shoved to the side.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334389">Unfortunately, in many situations that happens to this day. That is why we stand in the House and argue so vehemently for the right investments in this industry. I cannot think of a better time to be talking about this than now, during the economic crisis that we are under. One thing we have to realize is this. If we are to harvest a resource, if the people we represent are to be the principal beneficiaries of every natural resource, then it is a responsibility for us to allow industry to develop a product to its fullest. Value-added products, whether it be the fishery, manufacturing, textiles or forestry, is where we fit in to allow these people to extract as much profit as they can from this resource but, at the same time, to sustain the communities and the resource. That is what is imperative to us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334390"> I do not think government should just get out of the way. Let us talk about that right now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334391">A lot of people will say that if the forest industry is what we say it is, then it will survive on its own. That is not necessarily the case. The problem is communities die as a result of this. It is so labour intensive and it takes so much from our land. It is not only about the wood; it is about the power we harness on the rivers in order to fire up the mills. It is also about the community living structure, the social structure in which we live. To me that represents the key to this argument. That is why we have to get involved and play a role. That is why we stand here today and debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334392"> We can talk about the fine points. We can talk about the profit margins for a particular company. We can talk about the fact that we want to provide the incentive for a lumber yard to branch out into other types of products. That is what is key. We operate on the margins, but the bulk of the industry relies on the people who work day and night in our forests and also in the mills and in the ports that ship it out. This is why we stand here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334393">I will take a moment to bring forward a few quotes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334394">These are some of the points I received in an email from Bob Dingwall, president and CEO of Jamestown Lumber. I would rather bring his points out than just my own because he is someone who is absolutely hands-on with the entire industry. He writes that forestry, of course, is the mainstay of rural economies in many parts of Canada. He says, “Canada's forestry infrastructure, which includes huge amounts of human-skilled capital, in addition to the physical assets associated with the production of forest products cannot be allowed to further dissipate. It can't be pulled off the shelf for the next generation's benefit in the future global economy”.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1334395">That is very true. Forestry cannot be thought of in two, three, four-year increments. We have to start talking about generations of rural Canadians, urban Canadians and Newfoundlanders and Labradorians. We have to plan for the next generation forestry workers. Will they be different than today's workers? Most likely, yes, but at some point we have to grasp the vision as to what this industry will be. It is essential for that community. There is no way around this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334396">Unfortunately, being involved in politics, where we run on four-year mandates, or in this Parliament maybe one or two-year mandates, we have to realize that the long-term vision is key to what we debate. If we lose sight of that long-term vision, our rural communities and the entire nation in general does not have anything on which to hang. Sometimes, as I said earlier, we push forestry aside to its detriment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334397">We are not asking for a nationalized institution for the way forestry is run. We want to encourage private investment, but there has to be a positive influence by all levels of government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334398">Mr. Dingwall brought up other points. One was Scotiabank's commodity price index, which is a very important fact. In some of the other industries, such as metals and mining, the commodity price index assigns an index weight. Metals and mining is 16.6% as an index and oil and gas is 16.8%. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334399">According to Scotiabank's commodity price index, what is its assignment of an index weight? It is 39.8%. That is how much value is placed on what we produce. Many people rely on this industry and that one piece of lumber, that one tree, and the harvesting of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334400">Yes, we cut it down. Yes, we can create wood pellets and byproducts of wood, such as wood shavings, wood chips, the actual lumber itself, which is the massive part of this, and, on the back end, newsprint, paper products. All of this stuff is taken from a renewable resource.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334401">One thing the federal government has neglected in the past little while is silviculture. I hope that in the near future we will have a debate on the role of the federal government involved in silviculture, which is why I endorse the idea of a national summit for the forest industry. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334402">Some people might ask why we would gather all these people in one city to talk about forestry. That is where can have a frank discussion among government, industry and the unions as well, such as the Communications, Energy &amp; Paperworkers Union. These are the stakeholders. They have a vested interest in seeing this resource replenished and in ensuring we get the value from this resource.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334403">I also want to talk about the situation in Bonavista—Gander—Grand Falls—Windsor. As I mentioned, it has been around for about 100 years. Earlier this year the mill closure was devastating news. However, keep in mind that the resource at the very base of this mill belongs to the people. Should we expropriate the rights on the river to harness the power and to go into the forest to cut down trees for profit? Yes, we own it and we have to be the stewards of that resource. We are the ones who have to protect the concept that the principal beneficiary of this resource is the collective, the people who put us in power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334404">I would like to make that point clear because I think a lot of people have lost that point. Industry has a role, but it is not the be-all and end-all of harvesting this resource. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334405">Hopefully I will get some time following question period to continue my thoughts. I thank the House for listening to me and I welcome any questions or comments.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334406">Madam Speaker, I listened with interest to my colleague. I assumed that at some point in his 20 minute oration he would request the House to allow him a do over on his vote in support of the softwood lumber agreement. Unfortunately, the predictions the NDP made were correct. The contract designed by the Liberals and then implemented by the Conservatives with the Americans allows the Americans to decide when they do not like what a province does.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334407">I can recall Liberals and Conservatives alike saying that this would allow for peace in our trade relations with the U.S., that the Americans would no longer apply tariffs to our wood. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been charged to Ontario and Quebec and future charges will be charged to British Columbia and the others. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334408">Is there no regret at all in the hypocrisy of standing in the House and saying that he will be defending softwood lumber and lumber industries across Canada when it is coming to bear right now? At present, the cumulative effect of this perfect storm, a terrible agreement, a downturn in the housing market is destroying mills across northwestern British Columbia and Canada. This agreement allows the Americans to apply punitive damages against Canadian companies and provinces at their own discretion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334409">I enjoyed the member's comments, and we are good friends. However, is there no sense of regret over having rushed that bill through, having agreed to absolutely fall down with the Conservatives when it came to defending Canada's interests in the softwood lumber market?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334410">Madam Speaker, certainly notable exceptions have taken place with the softwood lumber deal. I agree with him that the money was left on the table and problems have been created as a result of that in this trade dispute. I suggest that he and others to go back to what I talked about earlier, and his party supports a forestry summit, and that is to talk about this industry in the context in which we are. He brought up the fact that we were in the context of a downturn. That started well before the recession took over.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334411"> One of the issues I had with the other side was the community trust fund. The accountability record on the community trust fund has been abysmal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334412">I will ask the government this. What does the community trust fund do for someone who has been laid off and is now looking for work in the town of Grand Falls--Windsor? My local newspaper, the <I>Grand Falls Advertiser</I>, recently did a story about Mr. Glen Frampton. After working so long in the mill, he is unable to find work, but also the accreditation to continue the skills he learned in the mill. How does the community trust fund help out a person like Mr. Frampton when it is for industries that have failed?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334413">This debate should be about how we protect those failing industries. The investments we make should maintain the mills. My mill is closing at the end of this month. What will the trust fund do to keep this mill open? Probably very little, and that is the debate I want to bring to the House.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334414">Madam Speaker, Liberals have been rising in the House to criticize the softwood lumber sellout that they put through the House and the Senate. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128759" Type="2">Skeena—Bulkley Valley</Affiliation> asked a very valid point. This whole agreement has blown up in the faces of those who pushed it forward: $68 million charged last week; an anticipated $400 million in charges coming in a few weeks, as my colleague mentioned; other lawsuits coming toward British Columbia and Alberta; and thousands of lost jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334415">I know the member to be a fair man. Could he simply rise and apologize to those thousands of Canadians who have lost jobs because of the softwood sellout. Could he apologize for the hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties that Canadians have been forced to pay? Could he just rise and apologize on behalf of the Liberal Party for inflicting this on Canadians?</ParaText>

In the province of Newfoundland and Labrador we had a fisheries summit that was chaired, incidentally, by a gentleman I know who used to sit in this House. His name was Loyola Hearn and he chaired the summit. What came out of that summit were some of the policy initiatives that we have today, some not so good, others pretty good, but it basically created a crossroads of communication for which I commend my former hon. colleague, Mr. Hearn, for doing at the time, and I wish him all the best, incidentally.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334683">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="128582" Type="2">Rimouski-Neigette—Témiscouata—Les Basques</Affiliation>, the Bloc Québécois' new private forests critic. The Bloc Québécois is the first party to have such a critic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334684">The Bloc Québécois decided to dedicate this day to the fact that the forestry industry, the industry as much as the workers, has been neglected, forgotten by the federal government. Why do we have to dedicate a day to this debate? Because the federal government has decided to have a double standard. On one hand, there is the auto industry that deserves a real helping hand. The federal government decided, for example, to go ahead with loan guarantees, offering companies the opportunity to get help from the government. On the other hand, there is the forestry industry, which has been abandoned by the federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334685">During question period, we saw—and this may prove very instructive for the <Affiliation DbId="128720" Type="4">Minister of State (Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec)</Affiliation>, who was saying that loan guarantees could not be used by the federal government because they are in conflict with the free trade agreements—that its own lawyers, before the London Court of International Arbitration in connection with the softwood lumber agreement, and the civil servants at Export Development Canada, EDC, are basically giving the okay to loan guarantees for the forestry industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334686">Why is the government now the only party that does not want to go ahead with this measure? The Bloc Québécois' work could result in success for business if we manage to make the government understand that the tool is available, that we can move forward, that we can offer loan guarantees to prevent companies from going bankrupt, not because of mismanagement, but because the U.S. market has shrunk dramatically. We have to make the government understand that we need a transition period, perhaps six months or a year, during which companies can go forward with loan guarantees, get the money they need, keep working, and maybe even buy equipment to improve productivity. That is the purpose of the Bloc's proposal today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334687">We know that the softwood lumber agreement, though not great, could have been worse. We had to sign it. In the past few weeks, industry representatives and workers in my riding have reminded me that the Bloc did the right thing when it supported the agreement. Now, the industry needs another helping hand because the U.S. market has dried up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334688">My riding is blessed with cross-border industries in Saint-Pamphile and Daaquam that mill American timber in Canadian mills, in Quebec mills, and then resell it, mostly to the American market. Luckily, they are exempt from the softwood lumber agreement. Unfortunately, they are not getting that kind of support from Economic Development Canada. The federal government and the ministers involved seem to think that the forestry industry's time is up, but thousands of jobs depend on it, and those jobs will last. There will always be a market for wood. If Quebec and Canada fail to do what must be done in time, they will have a much smaller share of that market in the future. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334689">This morning, the United Nations issued a reminder that one way to combat the slowing economy is to invest in silviculture. That is one of the approaches we could use. A lot of workers are out there planting trees. These people help create carbon sinks to absorb carbon, and their positive contribution will help us address climate change challenges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334690">The federal government, however, as is the case in so many sectors, is not sensitive to this reality. It is not doing enough to move forward on this file and it continues to view forestry as an outdated industry. It is nothing of the sort. It is an industry that definitely has a future, if the federal government moves forward on this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334691">There are also other measures the federal government could move forward on, primarily involving benefits that could be given to workers who lose their jobs. In a forestry community, in a municipality that depends on the forestry sector, when 25, 50 or 75 workers lose their jobs, this has a significant economic impact, an impact on their families and on the entire community. In that respect, the federal government has an excellent tool to intervene.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="10">(1510)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1334692">The Bloc Québécois is proposing the elimination of the waiting period when people qualify for employment insurance. At present, during the first two weeks of unemployment, unemployed workers receive no benefits, even though they pay into the system from the very beginning. This is an appalling feature left over from the old employment insurance system, which people paid into only after working for a few weeks. Since the Liberal reforms in 1994, people must pay into it from the very first hour, but they do not receive benefits right away.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334693">The federal government is looking for ways to stimulate the economy. One of the best ways would be to eliminate the waiting period and give unemployed workers employment insurance benefits beginning the very first week they are unemployed, thereby allowing them to remain consumers and keep the economy going. Apart from the tax cuts we have seen in the past, if we could return the favour now to those who were the key players in tackling the deficit, we should give them back their employment insurance benefits beginning on the first day of unemployment, by eliminating the waiting period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334694">With this motion, the Bloc Québécois is fulfilling precisely the mandate it was given, which is to defend the interests of Quebec. There is a need to do so in various areas, and particularly in economic matters. The incomes of families affected by the economic slowdown have to be protected. In that regard, measures have to be taken to move forward. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128582" Type="2">Rimouski-Neigette—Témiscouata—Les Basques</Affiliation> will certainly address that issue as the critic for these matters. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334695">I would like to point out that the slowdown has been such that, in the forestry industry, the sawmills that cut wood and the paper mills have been affected. However, those who often take a hit are the woodlot owners, who are not getting paid. They have to stop cutting wood because the prices they are getting are not enough to support production. In that regard, the government could have put forward a measure to help them trough these difficult times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334696">This Parliament must therefore go ahead and vote for the Bloc's motion which, among other things, proposes concrete action, as we did last fall with respect to the economy in general. We were the only party to do so. For the forestry industry, we are proposing loan guarantees. I discussed that proposal at the beginning of my remarks. Loan guarantees are permitted under international agreements and the FTA. We have demonstrated this. This was further evidenced by the representations made to the courts by government lawyers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334697">We are also calling for the establishment of a policy to encourage the use of lumber in the construction and renovation of federal public buildings. This is a specific measure the federal government could implement, which would not cost the government more in the end and would allow it to use lumber. As with all aspects of the economic slowdown, the buying power has to be maintained. When governments decide to implement infrastructure programs, they do so to keep the economy going. Deciding to build buildings with lumber would keep the forestry economy going. That would be a meaningful benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334698">We would also like to put in place measures to support the production of energy and ethanol from forest waste. It has become evident that ethanol produced from corn can be harmful to the environment. Energy products derived from forest waste are far less harmful to the environment, produce good results and use an under-utilized resource. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334699">Therefore, the Bloc Québécois has decided to use this day to discuss the forestry industry. This issue concerns several ridings as it directly affects employment in logging and milling, the paper industry and the entire wood processing sector throughout its territory.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334700">In the past, in Quebec and Canada, there was a sort of social pact whereby seasonal workers in resource regions could qualify for unemployment insurance benefits. In turn, they produced goods consumed in major centres. The Liberal reform of employment insurance in the 1990s broke that pact. It has never been re-established by the federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334701">We hope that this government will take action in this period of crisis. We need innovative solutions and these must be introduced by the federal government. Today, the Bloc Québécois is presenting constructive proposals and hopes that the Conservative MPs, especially those from Quebec, are listening and will ask their government to take action.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334704">Mr. Speaker, as usual, I listened to my Bloc Québécois colleague with a great deal of interest. What I do not understand is how the Bloc Québécois is involved in the current forestry crisis. Job losses in Quebec have risen sharply since October 2, 2006, when the softwood lumber agreement, that sellout agreement, took effect. Since then, thousands of Quebeckers in Mauricie, Abitibi-Témiscamingue, Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean and elsewhere in Quebec have lost their jobs. Because of the anti-circumvention clause, which the NDP had predicted the Americans would use, Quebeckers and Ontarians had to shell out $68 million last week. In a few weeks, another $400 million will be paid.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334705">Is the member prepared to admit that the idea of loan guarantees, which is good and which the NDP fully supports, is blocked by the softwood lumber agreement, that sellout agreement?

              <ParaText id="1334706">Mr. Speaker, in the past, the NDP has had valid ideas when it came to social equity. However, when it comes to the softwood lumber agreement, it is completely out of touch with reality. Again last week, I met with forestry industry leaders and workers. They said they were happy that the agreement had been signed, that it was not the best agreement in the world, but it was something. They told us that the agreement absolutely has to be maintained because it contains a dispute mechanism. They added that even if we lose some cases, we can win others. It relieved them of the sword of Damocles, which the Americans were dangling over their heads.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334707">I would be willing to bet that during the latest federal election the NDP lost at least 5 to 10% of the vote in my riding because they are so out of touch with this reality. People do not want to hear that the agreement should be denounced and that it would have been better to live worse off without it. People felt that the Bloc Québécois position on this was reasonable and asked us to continue supporting this agreement. Today, we continue to defend workers and industry leaders. The forestry industries of Quebec and Ontario need the tools that the Bloc Québécois are bringing forward, which the Conservatives still refuse to accept.</ParaText>

Last week, he could have helped the forestry industry, as he seems to claim to be doing in his remarks. In particular, he spoke about biomass conversion. The economic action plan sets aside $1 billion over five years for green infrastructure, with projects for biomass utilization, projects that are directed at communities, among others. There is $1 billion for communities, not to mention an amount of $170 million that is provided directly for the forestry sector, along with measures to stimulate the current weak demand, particularly from American customers. On one hand, we want to encourage demand, and build up infrastructure with increased lumber content in buildings. At the same time, as I have stated, we want to encourage home renovations that will certainly lead to increased demand for lumber products.</ParaText>

The lawyers who represented the Government of Canada before the courts in London did the same thing. The Conservative government is the only holdout. That is why we have tabled a proposal that calls for these things. I agree with him concerning the utility of wood construction. Thank goodness we can agree on that point. The Quebec forestry industry has issued a distress call to say that it needs loan guarantees. The Conservative government is the only one that does not want to move forward, even though its own lawyers admit that loan guarantees are a good management tool and the one that should be used. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1334713">Mr. Speaker, my Bloc Québécois colleagues who have risen on this opposition day have talked about the serious problems plaguing Quebec's forestry industry. I would like to join them in making this House aware of the forestry sector's problems, long neglected by the federal government. Today's Bloc Québécois motion points to the inadequacy of funding allocated in the latest budget to an industry that has been in crisis for several years and that, if left to its own devices, will suffer even more because of the current economic situation. That is why, in our motion, we have denounced the absence of specific measures to improve things for the forestry industry, measures such as bonuses, loan guarantees and refundable tax credits for research and development. We also strongly encourage the use of lumber in the construction and renovation of federal public buildings, along with new measures to support the production of energy and ethanol from forestry waste.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334714">Despite the government's excuses to cover up its lack of political will, all of these measures are legitimate and would not violate the international softwood lumber agreements that bind us. My colleagues have already gone into great detail about these aspects of our motion. I would like to focus on what is really going on with private woodlot producers in Quebec. I would like to talk about what is happening to 130,000 owners, 10,000 of which are located in the lower St. Lawrence region, where 50% of the woodlots are private. That is an indication of how important their activities are to local and regional development in my region. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334715">Over the past few years, private woodlot owners in Quebec have seen their situation get worse. They have been hit hard by the forestry crisis and have felt the impact of permanent and temporary plant closures, tighter markets for their wood, and sharply declining prices. Such are the consequences of an ongoing crisis that they are not equipped to deal with because of a lack of government support. In its most recent budget, the federal government once again ignored the needs of private woodlot owners in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334716">Richard Savard, who has responsibility for forestry in the regional conference of elected officials in the Bas-St-Laurent area, referred to the latest federal budget as a missed opportunity. In addition to being woefully inadequate and poorly targeted, federal assistance for the forestry industry in no way meets the needs of private woodlot owners. Yet private woodlots account for 29,000 direct jobs in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334717">In my region, Bas-St-Laurent, activities associated with private forest management and wood marketing create some 2,000 forest and factory jobs. In addition, the economic spinoffs from private woodlots are vital to our rural communities. It is crucial that the situation of private woodlot owners improve, because the survival of these communities depends on it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334718">In Bas-St-Laurent, the warden of the Témiscouata RCM, Serge Fortin, was outraged at Mr. Flaherty's insensitivity. According to the warden, because the minister is unaware of the impact that the forestry crisis is having on some regions, he does not appreciate that the loss of 500 jobs in our region is the equivalent of a loss of 10,000 jobs in Montreal. We have to bear in mind that, according to Department of Natural Resources data, 1,000 direct jobs have been lost in the forestry sector in Bas-St-Laurent since April 1, 2005. This is alarming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334719">Faced with the government's inaction, private woodlot owners are not just standing idle; they are doing everything they can to develop the full potential of their forest heritage. This means that, in addition to being undeniably important to rural communities, private forests can play an important environmental role when managed sustainably. They can help preserve wildlife habitat and ecological diversity, protect air and water quality, store carbon and reduce soil and shoreline erosion. In fact, thanks to the management of private forests, they are more productive today than public forests. Management is very profitable in the long run and deserves to be recognized.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334720">In the coming months, the Bloc Québécois will press the federal government to recognize management plans as proof of reasonable expectation of profit, so that woodlot management expenses are deductible under section 31 of the Income Tax Act.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="25">(1525)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1334721">The advantages of sustainable woodlot management are many, and we need to ensure that the federal taxation system is better adapted to this type of operation, which benefits the population as a whole.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334722">Under the present tax system, woodlot management expenses are not deductible from total farm income, and this tends to encourage poor forest management. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334723">In other words, the tax system as it applies to private woodlots is not beneficial to farmers and does not favour sustainable resource use. At the present time, there is no specific status under the Income Tax Act for woodlot owners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334724">In the eyes of Revenue Canada, most of them are seen instead as part time farmers or hobby farmers. That being the case, it is not easy for them to claim their operating losses. They have to prove there was a reasonable expectation of profit, and this is very hard to prove according to the present tax authority requirements. There is, therefore, a lot that needs to be done as far as taxation is concerned to achieve more appropriate recognition of the work of private woodlot owners. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334725">Another point on which the Bloc Québécois will place a great deal of emphasis is changes to the taxation system for private woodlot owners to allow averaging of revenue from the sale of wood produced by sustainable management or harvested after some natural disaster. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334726">This is a very reasonable request, given the great irregularities in forest income. One harvest year, the revenue could be high, but then growers have to wait a number of years before newly planted trees are mature enough for harvesting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334727">At the present time, woodlot operators' incomes are all taxable in the year of sale of the product, even if that income may represent 10 years of work and be followed by another 10 years totally without income.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334728">These are the reasons operators want income averaging for taxation purposes. That way, someone selling $200,000 worth of lumber this year could, for example, declare $20,000 income over the next 10 years. Obviously the taxation rate would be lower and this would make it possible for operators to live better off the proceeds. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334729">Today, measures must be taken to make forest resources a true lever for growth in the regions of Quebec such as the lower St. Lawrence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334730">For any progress to be made on this, I would first of all stress the two measures I have just set out: management plans and income averaging for private woodlot owners in Quebec. Supporting those measures is tantamount to recognizing the contribution made by private woodlots to regional development, and acknowledging that private woodlot owners have particular needs which must be listened to. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334731">Private woodlot owners can rest assured that the Bloc Québécois will continue to relay their demands to this House. </ParaText>

The Conservative softwood lumber deal basically took tens of millions of dollars out of the equation when the government made that deal and left all the billions of dollars in the United States.

That is the anticipation in the industry. When we see our way through the times that they face right now, Canada will be the leader in forestry around the world. There are a number of reasons for that, and I hope to get to some of those later. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334750">First, I want to talk about some of the work we have done. I have been on the natural resources committee both in the last Parliament and in this Parliament. Last spring, we decided we wanted to undertake a major study of the forestry sector. For three months, the natural resources committee focused on the forestry sector issues. We spent a lot of time on it. We did our work. I was glad to see that, in the end, we were able to come up with a unanimous report. As all of us in the House know, this does not happen very often. However, all the parties were able to agree on the recommendations. We were able to agree that there was a way forward that would work. We made recommendations to the government and the government put a number of those recommendations into our economic action plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334751">This is one reason why the Bloc should be supporting us instead of opposing the best interests of their constituents by working against the economic action plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334752"> I want to go through the committee recommendations and then go through what the government has chosen to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334753"> Recommendation 1 was to call a forestry summit to bring people together. Right after the report was tabled in the House of Commons last spring, we had a national round table. We brought folks in from across the country. We sat down and asked them what they thought about our report. We had consulted many of them when we were preparing it. They gave us their input and talked a bit more about the future. Once again, they felt there was a strong future for the industry. Since I began working on this file, I have appreciated the fact that there is this understanding that our country is going to play a major role in forestry around the world for many decades to come. The government acted on recommendation 1 very quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334754"> Recommendation 2 was that we establish a national forest industry innovation fund and that this fund be provided with sufficient resources to ensure the industry could be central in the development of the new bio-economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334755"> Several of the recommendations called for funding for research and innovation. We met this recommendation by putting together FPInnovations. We will talk a bit more about that great development later, as well as the money that has been committed to it and the tremendous work it has done in Quebec and across the country to bring new innovation to the forestry sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334756">Recommendation 5 was that the Government of Canada, in partnership with provinces and territories, should actively pursue policies that would encourage value-added manufacturing. We did that by addressing issues regarding access to credit and by extending the capital cost allowance. We will talk about that a bit later as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334757"> Recommendation 9 was that the Government of Canada extend that capital cost allowance. The committee recommended five years, but the government chose to do it for two years. It has been extended through 2010-11 and we will evaluate it further at that time.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="40">(1540)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1334758">Recommendation 15 was that the Government of Canada continue to work with first nations and other aboriginal communities to enable them to become active partners in the development of Canada's forests. We are certainly willing to do that. We are working with them. This spring a number of government members on the Natural Resource file were able to tour communities. One thing we heard regularly was that the process of consultation was important, one that needed to be productive and beneficial to all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334759">Recommendation 21 was that we work with the provinces and territories to provide full support for certification of Canadian forestry products. Anyone who is involved in the forestry industry knows that has been an important component, both for the industry and the government, so we continue to work on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334760">That was only one of the things we did about year ago, which was very important. We brought forward those recommendations. The government went through them during summer and the fall and when it came to our economic action plan, a number of those were included.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334761">This spring, as I mentioned, we also toured the country. The minister felt it was important that we not only listen to what was going on in Ottawa in regard to the forestry sector, but that we get out across the country. Before the House came back this spring, we did that. We fanned out and covered the country from one end to the other to hear what communities, individuals and companies involved in the forestry section had to say, what their concerns were, what the pressures were. I think that was beneficial for all of us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334762">I found it interesting that we were in the ridings of a couple of opposition members. We were there ahead of them and heard the concerns and problems of their constituents. They told us that the opposition members would be holding some hearings in the next couple of weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334763">Those consultations directly fed back to our economic action plan. The minister mentioned that this morning. We were able to bring the information and the concerns back to Ottawa, to the minister, and many of those things were brought forward and implemented in our action plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334764">That action plan is an integrated approach. It is a package for the whole country. That is the thing we need to remember today. It is done for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334765">I want to talk about a couple of the general things in that action plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334766"> First, everyone has heard about the $4 billion new commitment for infrastructure. That has been greeted across the country with a lot of interest. That is on top of the $33 billion that was committed previously to the infrastructure funding. There is a new $2 billion university fund that goes toward supporting universities and colleges, updating and renovating some of the facilities, bringing them up-to-date. There is a $1 billion clean green fund that will be put in place to encourage sustainable energy. All of these things will have good impacts and opportunities for wood and for wood manufacturers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334767">Through our economic action plan, we have brought in support for a whole number of areas. I want to break them down, one component at a time and talk about them so people get an understanding of how broadly based this plan, this integrated approach, is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334768"> Once I have done that, perhaps the Bloc will have a better understanding. I understand some of the Bloc members may have been too busy to read the economic action plan. Once they hear about all the areas it reaches into, they will probably consider voting against their motion today, joining with us to support what we are doing for our country and for the province of Quebec as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334769">We have committed support for communities across the country. We have heard a little about that today. This did not only start in the last month. Bloc members decided in the last few weeks that they had to bring forestry up every day. We were aware of this a while ago and we did some things a couple of years ago to address it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334770">Last year we put $1 billion into the community development trust. That money was given to the provinces. They had the choice of how they would spend it. For example, I am told the British Columbia spent $129 million of that money directly on forestry. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334771">The Bloc members should ask their provincial government to tell them how much of the development trust fund was spent on forestry. Then they can perhaps help it to direct more money into the forestry sector if that needs to be a priority in their province.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="45">(1545)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1334772">Obviously this year we have come forward again with the community adjustment fund, another $1 billion to try to mitigate the effects of the economic downturn. Again, Quebec does very well with these funds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334773">I should just point out that Quebec was entitled to about $216 million in the community development fund. It is projected it will get about another $211 million or $212 million out of the community adjustment fund. The first one was a development trust; this year it is a community adjustment fund. There will be a total of about $428 million that can then be put toward forestry, if that is what it determines to be the most important area that needs it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334774">I should also refer to some of the past initiatives. With respect to the pine beetle initiative, this government committed $200 million in order to help communities adjust to some of the new realities of having to deal with an environment where the pine beetle has devastated so much of the area and the economy. We had a chance to see some of the impact of that when we were on our tour in northern British Columbia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334775"> It is important that this money be delivered for communities, that it be delivered for infrastructure and that it be delivered for programming. That is why we put in place the development trust, the adjustment fund. That is why we committed money in the past to these communities in order to help them through these tough times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334776">We have also made some commitments to the companies that are involved in the forestry sector. As I mentioned earlier, we have accelerated the capital cost allowance. We have extended that for another two years. That has been very important for companies. It has given them the ability to buy new manufacturing processing machinery and equipment and then to depreciate that. This has worked very well for them on the tax side.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334777">Obviously the work share changes, the extensions that have been made, are being well received across this country. I remember in my own area in the early 1980s, we had a very tough time. A form of work share was put in place in the local factory. It meant that people could stay in our small rural community and continue to work. It made a huge difference for our community. I know that is going to make a difference across the country as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334778">We have also moved to provide access to credit. When we travelled across the country we heard that it was very important that there be improved access to credit. Our changes in the economic action plan will provide up to $200 billion of credit to address gaps in credit markets. This is for individuals and businesses. There is increased funding for the Business Development Bank of Canada. There is increased funding for the Economic Development Agency of Canada in the Quebec region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334779">This morning the EDC was at the finance committee. It said that last year, of the $80 billion it had committed, $14 billion went specifically to forestry. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334780">There are a lot of different avenues that companies now have in order to access credit and financing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334781">I should also point out that we have actively reduced tariffs, which means about $440 million in savings to industry over the next five years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334782">Technology, of course, plays a huge part in the forest industry and forest products. We believe that technology is actually going to lead the way in the renaissance of the forest industry in Canada. There are a number of initiatives the government is involved in, in terms of bringing new technology to the market. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334783">The Canadian Wood Fibre Centre has been put in place to find newer and higher value products and uses for woods and fibres. It is focused on developing new products, on stimulating innovation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334784">There is a value to wood program, which encourages value-added manufacturing. It promotes the transfer of technology from labs and research centres directly to the workplace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334785">Budget 2009, our economic action plan, commits $120 million over two years to support innovation in forestry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334786">I would be remiss if I did not mention FPInnovations and the tremendous work it is doing. We had the opportunity to tour its lab in Vancouver. Money has been committed to it and it is moving ahead on transformative technologies. We saw some very fascinating projects. It is working on developing technology that will allow buildings to be much larger and several storeys higher than in the past. There is a huge machine that can actually shake down the structures. It will be able to tell where the stress points are on the structures. It has been working with other countries to develop that in terms of protection in earthquake regions. It is working on projects where it mixes wood fibre with other new chemical compounds, making completely different organic substances, in order that there will be products in the future that were never even thought of in the past.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="50">(1550)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1334787">It was exciting to be on that tour and to see the $80 million that has been put into a transformative technologies program and another $40 million that has been put into pilot scale demo projects. The FPInnovations lab in Vancouver has a huge CT scanner to scan large logs. It can get down to the finest micro-scale development of the uses of wood. It is fascinating to see that taking place. The lab is focusing on emerging technology, forest biomass utilization, nanotechnology, a pile of things that many of us do not even understand but that hold a valuable and exciting future for forest products and their use.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334788">We have been supporting workers in a myriad of ways. This is very important to this government because, as I said, no one wants anyone to lose his or her job. We have put about $8.3 billion toward the skills training and transition strategy which involves a number of things. I mentioned the work share program. It is something that impacts workers and their families directly. It impacts their ability to remain in their communities which many people want to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334789">We have also funded the EI changes through that program. Those changes have been welcomed across Canada. We listened to what Canadians wanted in terms of changes to the EI program and we put them in place. There are more people applying for EI. We have committed more resources to try to make sure that those folks have quick service and that they can get the money that is coming to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334790">Again we come back to the community adjustment fund, the community development trust, which have a direct impact on communities that have gotten money from them. They have directly impacted the workers as well. That is about $428 million for the province of Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334791">Another initiative that has been really popular is the home renovation tax credit. That provides up to $1,300 in tax relief for people who undertake home renovations. Obviously that is something that is going to encourage the use of wood, the use of forest products. We think that is a great initiative. It creates jobs. It will stimulate local economies. In my rural area there are a lot of people who are looking forward to doing those projects. That tax credit is going to allow them to move ahead with that. It creates a demand for wood. I am told that it is going to provide for up to one billion board feet this year in Canada alone to meet the requirements of that project. That seems to be an awfully large amount of wood.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334792">There is $50 million in credit that is available for mortgages that was not available prior to our economic action plan. We have also been working on developing markets. Members can begin to see that there is a complete strategy here, obviously. Markets are very important. We put $50 million into expanding markets around the world to emphasize our wood product use and to move ahead with that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334793">The softwood lumber agreement has been a point of discussion today. I think one thing we can all agree on is that it did stabilize the Canadian lumber industry. We received over $4 billion back in penalties that had been taken. That has created some stability in this country in terms of understanding what we can do in our relationship with the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334794">The economic action plan includes $50 million to diversify markets for Canadian wood products. We are looking to expand the North American market as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334795">We have been in the Chinese market. We went into the Wen Chuan earthquake region. We went in with wood and have been in there doing projects. We have explained to the Chinese that wood is much safer than some of the products they had been using prior to the earthquake. We have built some buildings, and I understand that clinics, schools and homes have been put in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334796">Mr. Speaker, there is a lot more that I would like to say, but I see that you are indicating that my time is almost up here. I am going to try to wrap up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334797">The motion today calls for a number of things. The motion calls on us to provide loans and loan guarantees. We have extended credit in a huge way. Again I will point out that $14 billion of the EDC's $80 million went into forestry last year. It calls for tax credits for research and development. I have talked about the incredible investment that we made in research and development. It talks about encouraging the use of lumber. We have done that through the home renovation tax credit. It talks about measures to support energy and ethanol production. We are doing that through the $1 billion green fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334798">I think it is time to quit trying to create division and despair. We have a plan. We are pushing ahead. We welcome the other parties to join with us on that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334799">Mr. Speaker, I listened attentively when my colleague from the Conservative Party spoke about today's Bloc Québécois motion and it shocked me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334800">It was surprising to hear him say that the Conservatives listened to what citizens wanted in terms of measures to improve employment insurance. They say that they have improved the system by adding five weeks. But we know that, particularly in the forestry sector, job loss is cyclical. In any case, I have not heard anyone in my riding, and very few in Quebec, say that the Conservative government consulted them about this. On the contrary, people are telling us that the right thing to do would have been to eliminate the two week waiting period because, as I said earlier, these people have cyclical work. They will work for 25 or 40 weeks and then will be temporarily laid off for 10 or 15 weeks. It really is the two week waiting period that hurts them the most. In addition, quite often a couple works for the same company, so they are doubly penalized. What the government has proposed does not really help them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334805">It did not start just with the economic crisis that we are facing. It started with the flawed softwood lumber deal.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334807">The member went through the provisions of the motion. It is very similar to the strategic plan for forestry that the Liberals brought in in 2005, and which the Conservatives cancelled when they formed government in 2006.</ParaText>

I hate to think where we would be if legislators were pushing it now with the market collapsing in the U.S. and our industries not receiving that money back.

              <ParaText id="1334832">I would like to remind the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128822" Type="2">Cypress Hills—Grasslands</Affiliation> of one of his speeches concerning income splitting relating to the settlement of the softwood lumber crisis two years ago. It is a bit of an embarrassment to bring that up now, because at that time $23,000 was allocated to provinces that did not really need it, and provinces where workers were really badly hit by the crisis received only $2,300 per lost job. That was highly discriminatory.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334833">Today the Bloc Québécois is presenting a motion in reaction to the planned assistance to the forestry industry. This wishy washy and mediocre plan for $170 million announced in the 2009 budget is spread over two years and is for all of Canada. It is intended as assistance to a forestry sector that is in crisis and one that is, let us not lose sight of this, mostly in Quebec and the eastern part of the country. This amount is laughable and clearly inadequate. It does not in any way correspond to the industry's needs. It will just melt away like snow on a sunny day before it can do any good. This is far from being my personal view of the situation, or even that of the Bloc Québécois.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334836">In fact, all that this assistance is doing is prolonging programs that had already proven unattainable and unworkable as far as counteracting the effects of the softwood lumber crisis is concerned, programs that this government had not managed to adapt in the past and seems still unable to adapt. It seems there is a lack of understanding on the part of the Conservative Party as far as the present forestry crisis is concerned, since it has not managed to learn from its mistakes in order to correct them at last, even partially, in order to make it better suited to meeting the needs of the industry in this time of crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334837">The softwood lumber industry has been going through major difficulties for a number of years now. It has had to cope with the imposition of antidumping duties and countervailing duties by the US, coupled with rising energy and raw material costs, and in particular with the higher rate of exchange of the Canadian dollar. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334838">Today, with the economic slowdown in the States, the number of construction starts has fallen, causing a drop in demand for wood products. As sawmills supply the pulp and paper industry with wood chips, the drop in sales of softwood lumber means fewer wood chips. Second, third and fourth stage processing industries are also closing their doors, industries like pulp and paper, particle board, wall panelling, cogeneration plants, transport companies and forestry companies with many of their specialty suppliers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334839">We can only criticize the current government's lack of foresight and point to the lack of courage on the part of the Quebec members, who have been incapable of suggesting ways that might revive the industry. This obvious lack of courage has highlighted the ignorance of the leaders of this party, or of this coalition, should I say, since the Liberals supported this budget. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334840">It was not a problem for the Conservatives because at that point, when the budget was tabled, what counted was tripping up the Liberal party, the other party of the coalition, by making such an offer to the automotive industry that it could not reject the Conservative budget without attracting the wrath of Ontario voters. And by rewarding western voters with sumptuous tax credits to the oil companies, a sector still bubbling at the moment, Canada was gratified. Quite a message to Quebec and the Maritimes. Are the Conservatives so calculating that they consider these provinces negligible? </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334841">This is why the Bloc rises and proposes specific measures to meet this crisis. The forestry crisis means jobs lost for thousands of workers, with all of the human drama that entails. It also means dire consequences for other sections of the population. The impact of the forestry industry on economic and local development is crucial. The pay of forestry workers has a considerable impact on regional consumption. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334842">In addition, other sectors, such as transport, supply and subcontracting, local businesses and services are feeling the effects of the crisis in the forestry industry. According to Service Canada, for each job lost in the forestry industry, nearly six-tenths of a job will be lost indirectly in local business. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334843">The forestry industry is a major employer in Quebec. Forestry operations and management, primary, secondary and third stage processing of wood and research activities generate economic benefits in a number of resource regions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334844">Faced with the inaction and deaf ears of the federal government, the Bloc Québécois is demanding a comprehensive assistance package to support the industry and help it get over the downturn. This plan should include specific measures to ensure sustainable development, including loans and loan guarantees, refundable tax credits for research and development, policies to encourage the use of lumber in the construction and renovation of federal buildings, measures to support the production of energy and ethanol, and assistance for research into the best uses of forestry waste.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334845">The forestry industry provides more than 6,860 jobs in Abitibi-Témiscamingue alone, as well as hundreds more in the Nord-du-Québec region. Many families in my riding are affected by this crisis, either directly or indirectly. The unfortunate recent plant closures for indeterminate periods will result in about 2,300 factory job losses in Abitibi-Témiscamingue and Nord-du-Québec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334846">As a result of the poor economic conditions in Lebel-sur-Quévillon, a town of 3,000, Domtar closed for good its plant employing 425 people. If this figure is transposed to a city like Montreal, it is the equivalent of 550,000 lost jobs. Just imagine the economic impact. As if that were not enough, the Comtois sawmill also located in Lebel-sur-Quévillon has temporarily ceased operations, putting another 286 people out of work, or the equivalent of 300,000 jobs in Montreal. Not even Alberta or the Conservatives could stand up to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334847">The difficulties in the pulp and paper industry are prompting a company like AbitibiBowater to take tens of thousands of tonnes of newsprint off the market every month because of low sales. The Tembec sawmill in Senneterre has also had to cease operations, as it announced today. The forestry industry is closed down once again for periods running from three weeks to a month. Senneterre is another forestry town that has had its share of job losses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334848">The forestry industry needs help right now. Not tomorrow; now. The Conservative government still has not grasped this, as can be seen in the fact that the <Affiliation DbId="128683" Type="4">Minister of National Revenue</Affiliation> just suggested holding a forum to find some solutions. I would like to remind him that 400 people met in Quebec City a year and a half ago for the Summit on the Future of the Quebec Forest Sector. As the minister responsible for Canada Economic Development, he set up advisory committees before the summit and still consults them, although without proposing any solutions to the crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334849"> The solutions are well known, however. As Guy Chevrette of the Québec Forest Industry Council said recently: “The troubles we are currently experiencing are a liquidity and refinancing problem. They know that”.

              <ParaText id="1334851">It is imperative that we get the point across to the <Affiliation DbId="128685" Type="96">Minister of National Revenue</Affiliation> and his government that the time for talking or holding a so-called forum is passed and that now is the time to act.</ParaText>

If the member were aware of what is going on in B.C., he would know it is actually a very complicated issue, as it is in Quebec, where logs are imported from the U.S. Moving the logs across the border is a complicated issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334857">One of the main aspects in British Columbia is the difference between crown land and private land. Crown land is provincial.

However, regulations cannot be imposed by the federal government without cooperation from the provincial government. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334873">These people realize that they are in a very difficult situation. That is why the Bloc Québécois has presented this motion today. The Quebec forestry industry is in a crisis, as many others have said. We are all agreed that we are now in a recession, but the Quebec forestry industry has been in a crisis since 2005.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334874">It has been suffering the effects much longer than many people in other areas who have just lost their jobs. We agree that it is difficult. It is always a shame when people lose their jobs. However, entire towns have been deprived of income for many years. Families no longer have jobs. In some cases, both parents have been laid off by the same company. People are suffering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334875">There are 88,000 workers in the Quebec forestry industry. They are, in effect, the economic engine of many regions in Quebec. This crisis is hitting them with full force. I just said this has been going on since 2005. During the last four years, people have been struggling with these situations. Processing plants, sawmills and other plants, have been closing their doors, one after another, sometimes for good and sometimes temporarily. There is nothing in this Conservative government budget to really help the workers who are losing their jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334876">They boast of having added five weeks of employment insurance, but in terms of effectiveness and as a support measure for people who lose their jobs, it is practically meaningless because almost 75% of the people who lose their job will find a new one before the Conservative government issues their 45th or 46th employment insurance weekly benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334877">So, it is not a very effective measure. Once again, the Conservative government has introduced this measure to try to make political capital. However, if it had abolished the two week waiting period, then it would have done something to really help workers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334878">This is not the first time the Bloc Québécois has put forward a plan. We did it last year, to support the entire forestry industry. I will come back to that later. Last year, the Bloc proposed several measures that are still very relevant. In proposing them again last November, we had hoped that the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance </Affiliation>would have considered them before introducing an ideological economic statement. We did propose them again, but, unfortunately, he did not take them into account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334879">We know the federal government has the necessary resources. We know that, and its budget is supporting the auto industry in Ontario with $2.7 billion in funding. For the forestry industry, however, it is offering $170 million for all of Canada. This is a catastrophe. Quebec's forestry industry is an important driving force. Yet there is nothing in this budget to really help that sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334880">The Bloc Québécois has already asked the government several times, and we are asking once again, to give these businesses and these workers some support. We are calling on the government to grant loan guarantees and assistance to modernize their equipment.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1334881">We know—at least we all hope—that the recovery will come one day and that people in many places want to be ready for it, but the federal government refuses that idea. It objects, saying that it would be in violation of the softwood lumber agreement and the free trade agreement, and that it would only create a host of problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334882">However, at the Standing Committee on Finance today, we learned directly from Eric Siegel, president and chief executive officer of Export Development Canada, that his organization—a financial branch of the federal government—has granted loans and loan guarantees to businesses in the forestry sector. I told him that I assumed that when he was doing business with those companies and when he was granting the loans and loan guarantees, he was doing so in compliance with international agreements like the free trade agreement and the softwood lumber agreement. Mr. Siegel told us that, yes, he could not do business any other way and that he could not ignore those agreements. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334883">So on one hand the government is telling us that it is illegal, that giving loan guarantees is not in compliance with the softwood lumber agreements. And, on the other hand, we see that the president and CEO of EDC, a federal government agency, is saying the opposite, that his organization is doing this while fully respecting the softwood lumber agreement. This seems to me to be such an obvious contradiction that it makes no sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334884">The current Conservative federal government must review its position and admit that it has been completely wrong, that it misled us and that it must allow loan guarantees for forestry businesses. For some, that would mean avoiding bankruptcy, and for others it would mean continuing progress. It would also mean that the forestry industry would become more innovative and competitive, particularly in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334885">If we were to listen to the Conservatives, the forestry regions would be left to die. I am sorry, but there are still people and workers who are very productive, people who are well trained and who are not willing to say that their region is dying. They want to keep contributing to their region's growth and to the growth of the economy in their communities. However, what we are hearing and what we can understand from the reactions of the Conservative government and its elected members, is that, for them, it as though the regions are dying and have no future and so these regions must give in to the mass exodus of youth and to high unemployment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334886">But we are saying—and this is what those people are saying too and this is what they want to hear—that forestry can provide significant leverage and we have not explored all of the options. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334887">Earlier, I listened to the question put to my colleague about the processing that should be done here. When we export unfinished products, we are exporting jobs too. We have to do something about this. We must invest energy and large sums of money in research and development, so that Quebec's raw materials—the wood from our private and public forests—can be processed here, as close as possible to the people who cut down the trees and take them to the closest town, and so that new products can be developed and marketed from there. That is what we need, but at the same time, we have to support companies with loan guarantees, we have to enable them to buy new equipment so that they can compete internationally. That is how we will really support them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334888">Thank you for your attention. I will be happy to answer any questions.</ParaText>

The <Affiliation DbId="128720" Type="4">Minister of State for the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec</Affiliation> says that the government cannot provide loan guarantees because they make no sense and they will prevent or delay the signing of agreements and so on.

For instance, in northern Manitoba, where I am from, part of the region continues to really depend on the forestry industry. The companies have not shut down, and people are still working. What concerns them is that the government is not supporting those industries that continue to operate. Attention has to be paid not only to the regions that have already lost that part of their economy, but also to supporting the regions where companies are surviving and need help. </ParaText>

Companies continue to operate, but are struggling. They clearly need help. At the same time, we must not forget the regions with companies that have closed temporarily. It is important that help be provided across all these regions. The fact that an industry or company has experienced what I would call temporary difficulties does not justify letting it down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334900">It is important that the government realize that the forestry industry still has a bright future in Canada and Quebec.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1334901">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to this motion today. It is a very important motion that is before the House because many members of the House of Commons come from ridings where forestry is important. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334902">I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="128759" Type="2">Skeena—Bulkley Valley</Affiliation> who comes from a riding where forestry is important. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334903">I want to put a little context to this because forestry is not only important in my riding but it is an essential industry in the province of B.C. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334904">The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives has done several analyses on the forestry sector. In a recent analysis on February 13, it talked about the fact that B.C. has lost 65 sawmills, 4 pulp mills and 20,000 jobs in the forestry industry. With a spinoff effect of about one to three, this means a loss of about 60,000 jobs just in British Columbia alone. We must not forget about the tens of millions of dollars of revenue that is no longer being sent to government coffers to help pay for health care and education.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334905">When we talk about forestry jobs, we are not just talking about the loss of good paying jobs for forestry workers and their families. We are also talking about the spinoff impact for all of those other industries that directly support forestry. For example, in my riding, Madill, a company that made logging equipment, went bankrupt. We are also talking about restaurants, retail shops and car dealers that all benefit from good paying forestry worker jobs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334906">When we take it from the provincial level down to the local level, we have had a number of closures that have had a cascading effect in my riding and throughout Vancouver Island.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334907">Catalyst Paper announced the closure of the Crofton kraft pulp mill around the middle of February. It is shutting its doors at its 350 employee mill in Campbell River on the north island and the restructuring layoff of 127 workers at its Powell River facility. That is basically 850 jobs just in one sweep. This says that we need a coordinated response. We cannot do piecemeal responses to this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334908">The B.C. Federation of Labour president, Jim Sinclair, wrote a letter to the Premier of British Columbia about the importance of the forestry sector in British Columbia. He said, “It contributes close to 40% of B.C.'s exports and 25% of our GDP in the province of British Columbia”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334909">He goes on to say, and this is an important reminder to all of us, “Let it not be said that forestry is a sunset industry”. Jim Sinclair pointed out that “We believe a strong, sustainable forestry industry can continue to be a vital component of our economy”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334910">We need to ensure we are putting in place measures at the federal and provincial levels and whatever support we can provide for the municipalities to ensure our forestry sector remains strong and vibrant and a vital part of our economy, whether it is the logging operations, the processing value-added operations or the support industries that surround it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334911">The motion does talk about the fact that we need to be solutions oriented. It talks about the elements that need to be in place for our forestry plan. I want to touch base on a couple of those and I want to pay particular attention to the value-added sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334912">The CCPA wrote a paper back in June 2007 called “Wood Waste and Log Exports on the BC Coast”. These are important numbers because they say that roughly one in three logs from coastal forest lands failed to be run through provincial mills. One-third of all timber cut in British Columbia failed to be processed in British Columbia. That is a significant number. In its analysis, it did the cost of not turning those logs into lumber and other wood products here in B.C. The loss was estimated to be 5,872 jobs in 2005 and 5,756 jobs in 2006. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334913">It goes on to talk about raw log exports. Anyone from British Columbia will be very familiar with the need to change the raw log exports policy in British Columbia. CCPA did an analysis on the raw logs and the impact it was having on both our communities and the public purse. It talks about the fact that raw log exports from public and private forest lands in coastal B.C. have been a long outstanding concern. Since 2000, when annual log exports stood at 2.68 million cubic metres, out of province raw log shipments have risen by more than 75% to 4.7 million cubic metres. This increase alone amounts to 57,714 highway trucks of raw logs, enough wood to keep two sizable sawmills supplied for a whole year.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1334914">That is criminal, I would argue. Over 90% of the land in British Columbia is crown land. That means it is owned by the people of British Columbia; yet the people in British Columbia are not benefiting from this resource. We are shipping those logs out of the country, south of the border and overseas for processing while one sawmill after another closes its doors, laying off workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334915">There used to be something called a social contract in British Columbia. That meant that if a company had the right to cut the trees, they had to mill them close to home. That social contract has been broken. I would argue that one of the solutions to some of the problems facing British Columbia would be to reinstate that social contract.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334916">We could name any number of mills we have seen close. One that this paper cited was the New Westminster sawmill. The cessation of production at that site cost 284 workers their jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334917">In talking about solutions, one of the things I talked about was raw logs. I want to talk about the immediate situation for just one moment. One of the things that we know has to happen to help out forestry workers in British Columbia and throughout this country is that we have to do something about the employment insurance program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334918"> I am very proud of the fact that New Democrats put forward a motion last week asking for this House to support EI, and we will be voting on that important motion tonight. I would urge every member in this House to talk about eliminating the waiting period, reducing the eligibility requirements to 360 hours, and dealing with some of the regional anomalies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334919">Some regions are linked up with another region where the unemployment rate is higher. For example, my own region is linked into Vancouver, where the unemployment rate is much lower. Our workers actually get fewer weeks of employment insurance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334920">We need to do something immediately for those workers and their communities. We know that when workers have that social safety net, they spend the money in their local community on food, shelter, the necessities of life, and it helps keep our local economies going.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334921">I talked about the raw logs and the need to ban raw logs. We also need to look at support for value added, and there are a number of ways we can do that. We can look at refundable tax credits. We can look at elements around research and development. Again, that important social contract that says raw logs will be processed closer to home would be really a way to encourage value-added manufacturing in the province of British Columbia. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334922">One of the things Mr. Sinclair pointed out in the letter I read was about the deindustrialization of British Columbia. As we continue to ship our resources somewhere else to be processed, it means we are losing some of our own manufacturing capacity. That manufacturing capacity is an important element in keeping the economy of British Columbia viable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334923">In the longer term, provincial New Democrats under the leadership of Carole James have proposed a detailed plan on what could help out our ailing forestry sector. I do not have time to go through all the elements of that plan, but I do want to touch on a couple of points.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334924">They have a five-point plan where they flesh it out. The first one is to create a green plan for B.C.'s forests, and there are a number of elements under that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334925">The second one is to develop an innovative 21st century forest product industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334926">The third one is to create a community and worker stability program, and it has to do better than the community trust fund that we saw in this House, because many workers were simply left out in the cold. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334927">Even though in British Columbia we have a forestry sector that has been in crisis for years, many of the workers, because they had been laid off prior to that date that was set in 2007, were simply not eligible. Yet they had spent 30-some odd years working in the forestry sector. If we are going to look at creating a community and worker stability program, it actually has to take a look at all of the workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334928">The fourth one is to establish a permanent commission on forestry; and the fifth one concerns softwood lumber and forest tenure reform. New Democrats have spoken on this in the House many times. We were adamantly opposed to that softwood lumber deal. We are now seeing the impacts in our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334929">One of the important parts of Carole James' plan is that we need a complete, comprehensive assessment of the resources that can be derived from B.C. forests. That includes eco-system services, timber resources, and non-timber resources. We need to have this comprehensive review.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334930"> In the last decade or so when forestry was in a lot of trouble, we used to talk about “stump to dump”. We need a plan that looks at our forestry sector right from the time the trees are planted, all the way through until we are looking at waste products. It is that kind of innovation and research and development initiative that will keep a healthy forestry sector and well-paying jobs in our communities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334932">She mentioned Catalyst in Crofton and Campbell River.

              <ParaText id="1334933">The member raised the log export issue. She would know the complications with private lands and public lands, and of course, with federal and provincial jurisdictions. However, the real problem we are faced with is the collapse of the market. With the terrible downturn in the U.S. and its surplus of houses, the Americans are not building homes. They are not using our products. They are not buying them right now. That is the problem. That is why the products are not moving.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334934">I want to ask the member whether she feels that the $170 million that the government is putting forward to help in forestry initiatives that are directed at diversification and forest innovation are not the very things that she is asking for to help get our forest industry going again.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334935">Mr. Speaker, of course, the member is well aware, being from British Columbia, that the job losses in B.C. did not start with the downturn in the U.S. economy. Those job losses have been going on for several years. People such as the CCPA have been talking about the fact that we need a proactive strategy for forestry in British Columbia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334936">The member rightly points out that, with raw logs, there are different issues between public and private lands. What I am urging is that the provincial and the federal governments work together to address their respective responsibilities around how raw logs continue to flow out of our province and are processed somewhere else.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334937">When it comes to the elements that are in the current budget around forestry, certainly we welcome those elements, but they do not go far enough. I talked specifically about short-term responses to workers' needs, and employment insurance was an element that was absolutely not dealt with in terms of the way forestry workers are being impacted. The five weeks at the end does not help the forestry workers who simply do not qualify because of the number of hours that are required and being tied to a different labour market.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334939">The problem here started with the cancellation of the 2005 strategy of the then Liberal government on forestry assistance. The Conservatives overturned that strategy and then carried on with the flawed softwood lumber deal, as the member well knows, where billions of dollars were left on the table. Although the government said it would be dealt with and there would be no more court problems, the fact is that we are back in court today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334940"> I have listened to the last Conservative speaker outline all the provisions of the budget that he feels would assist the forestry sector, and it turns out that his party is still not supporting this particular motion. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1334946">Mr. Speaker, while I thank the Bloc Québécois for raising the issue of forestry, there was a pretense of doing so while having supported so many of the measures that got us into this trouble in the first place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334947">Forestry unfortunately has become a symbol of the hollowing out of Canada's manufacturing sector, whether we look at steel or the auto industry. Even aspects of the value-added mining industry have gone away from our country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334948">For Canadians to understand how critical this is for our economic future and where we pick ourselves up from this recession and go forward, it is pivotal to understand that these are the very industries that built this country, that in fact built this place, and enabled governments for generations to provide the health care, education, and spending on things we care so much about. They found their home in many of these industries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334949">I cannot help but think of Houston, British Columbia, a relatively small town consisting of 3,000 people. They have very minimal health care, barely adequate education, yet every year, doing their part and pulling their weight, being part of the fabric of Canada, they pour millions and millions of dollars into the coffers of provincial and federal governments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334950">Within the forestry sector in particular, we know it is hard, demanding, and dangerous work. Folks expect over time to put in a hard day's work and receive fair pay. Unfortunately, the very industries that built this country are now being thrown away, chipped away, sold off in negotiations like we saw with softwood, sold off at various times as we in Canada no longer stand up for the values and beliefs that we once held, that there was a national interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334951">There are many who would point out and are going to take what I might call “the convenient truth” in their eyes that the only reason we are facing this calamity is because of a world recession, a meltdown in the U.S. housing market. However, those of us who come from forestry communities across Canada have seen the slow and steady erosion of that base across the board. This is not a new phenomenon. It did not start when the housing bubble popped in the U.S. It did not start when the Canadian dollar started to gain value compared to the U.S. This started a long time ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334952">Policies were put in place, perhaps with the best of intentions, but had effects on the overall workforce and the overall productivity and efficacy of our forestry sector. This debate is about both the past and the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText Interjection="e1" id="1334953">
                <B>Mr. Richard Harris:</B> Which policies?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334954">
                <B>Mr. Nathan Cullen:</B> My Conservative colleague is heckling. One of pertinence that was brought out by the province—this is a policy I am naming for my Conservative colleague, if he does not mind being quiet for a moment to hear it—was actually a Socred, right-wing policy in B.C. that said, wouldn't it be a neat idea if we tied the value of the resources nearby to the communities that rely on those resources? That was later scrapped by another version of the Socred Party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334955"> What we see in northern B.C. is full logging trucks passing each other every day, going six, seven, eight, or nine hours down the road to super mills, which was the model that was meant to save us if we just allowed consolidation of the industry. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334956">We saw that with the federal government, which was no longer asking the departments that were meant to stop anti-competitive behaviour in places like Burns Lake, Fort St. James and Mackenzie. That anti-competitive behaviour built up communities that no longer had the adaptability to adjust when one company ran into trouble. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334957">As my colleague on the Conservative benches will know, when a couple of announcements popped up in Mackenzie, it virtually killed the town. It put the entire town into a state of seizure. If we look back 10, 20, or 30 years ago, we had a much more adaptable and flexible forestry industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334958">This debate is about both the past and the future. There are going to be disagreements in all corners of the House about how we got to this place. Some of us will look at the fact that we gave a veto to a foreign government in the softwood lumber agreement and allowed it to decide which measures we were taking were anti-competitive and which ones were not. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334959">Then we allowed it to slap us with tariffs, which it did, which we predicted it would do and will do again to British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario and Quebec. It hit our industry with punitive damages on policy directed by the provinces, where even the federal government has no jurisdiction or role. Somehow Washington has something to say about it. What kind of agreement is that when we start to muddle the jurisdictions that are instilled and enshrined in our Constitution? These are fundamental differences of opinion that I have with colleagues across the way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334960">Whether it was due to a fixation on U.S. housing markets, with mega mills focused there and only there, we urged the government year after year to please allow for a greater diversification of where our markets go, to put more money into marketing Canadian wood to other markets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334961">We saw the housing market bubble grow and grow year after year, and we saw the over-dependence on the Canadian supplier side to that market. There were those of us both in the House and in the forestry sector who said this was a dangerous formula.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="55">(1655)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1334962">If we have an industry that is dependent upon an economy that creates a bubble and the bubble inevitably pops. However, the good times were good times and we had to keep going with the policies that got us there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334963">We cannot use the convenience of a global recession to say that this is what is going on in forestry or manufacturing. We have seen, as has been noted, the successive de-industrialization of our country, year after year. These are flat-out statistics. My colleagues can argue as to the reasons why or why not, but the fact of the matter remains.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334964">It was pointed out that a study showed raw log exports went absolutely crazy in British Columbia. The federal government had nothing to say about the international trade policy on this one, for some strange reason. We saw that 5,800 jobs in 2007 simply were not there. Those are 5,800 value-added jobs that each of us would die to have in our constituencies, even 1,000. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334965">I am sure my colleagues from <Affiliation DbId="128650" Type="2">Nanaimo—Cowichan</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="128427" Type="2">Nanaimo—Alberni</Affiliation> would be celebrating if the front page of his paper stated that a 1,000 value-added jobs were created in his riding. It would be a great thing because those jobs are hard to come by and they are hard to create. Meanwhile we have policies that direct us not to create those jobs, rather to export those raw logs. We are made to feel that this is a sound and wise policy for the country's future. It is not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334966">We now have to look also to the future. Communities have stepped forward time and time again. I have watched my communities in Terrace, Prince Rupert and Hazelton absolutely go through some of the most devastating and punishing economic news imaginable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334967">I would like members to try to appreciate the effect this would have at home. We are talking unemployment rates of 70%, 80% and 85% when one or two mills go down. I want people to contemplate that and understand what it is to see eight or nine out of every ten workers out of work. It is devastating not just on brute economics, but on the social fabric of the community and the hope that young people do not feel as they go through school.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334968">Recently I was at a graduation ceremony in Hazelton. I did a quick straw poll with the 60 or 70 graduates students. I asked who was planning to go away to school and then come back to the community to set up a family, a home and a life. Out of those graduates, one hand went up. That is for a reason. There is no hope for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334969">Communities are coming forward time and time again with ideas and proposals, yet we see the government do something so callous, and I hope the Conservatives will stand up and answer this question. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334970">We looked through this year's budget to find the funds dedicated to the pine beetle crisis in B.C. I hope my colleague from Prince George understands this. A commitment was made by the federal government to B.C. and its residents to assist in with the pine beetle. When this announcement was first made by the former minister of natural resources, I congratulated him in the press. I told him that it was a good thing and that we needed to get that money out the door. As we heard from the chief forester of British Columbia today, we cannot find money in the budget. It has been rolled in and the accountability is gone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334971">Folks are saying that British Columbia is in the middle of one of the most ecologically devastating things ever seen. The government made a serious, honest and binding commitment to the people of British Columbia to come forward with that money. We have looked to see where and to whom that money has gone. So little money has flowed out and what little was promised, no longer appears present.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334972">We also know the forestry industry has the potential to be reborn. Someone said that we should not call this a sunset industry. Know that mill managers, town councils and chambers of commerce are coming together with ideas and proposals to diversify what happens at their mills. There is the possibility of energy generation. There is value added in different sectors. There is the ability to see this industry in a new light.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334973">We are begging the federal government to speed it up. In the first round of announcements on money, it was 16 months before proposals were even ready to go out the door. Mayors, municipalities and plant managers were furious that it would take 16 months to get a proposal together for a so-called crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334974">We know the industry can improve and recover. It will change and it will look different, but we have to understand that the policy of a tax cut for a company going under does not allow it to make it to the next quarter. It does not allow it to have hope for the next year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334975">We need to have more than just one bullet, but when all we have is a hammer, every problem starts to look like a nail. The government has been ill-equipped. There must be some responsibility. The federal government has an enormous amount of power. With that power, comes responsibility. There is a responsibility in this case to own up to failed policies and half attempts and to recognize what is needed. Without this, the devastation will continue. We simply cannot do that if we are to be elected leaders of the country.</ParaText>

We are dealing with a forestry industry that is in tremendous transition. The interior has been hammered hard by pine beetle and that will change things for decades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334977">The whole industry has changed since the gravy days of the 1980s to which the member referred. He is right that there have been tremendous changes. The downturn in the U.S. economy in the last half a year has been the final hammer in a whole series of changes in the forestry industry. The latest slam is really devastating our industry. However, we are competing today against inferior products from other parts of the world. We still have the best coastal timber in the world on the coast of B.C. The challenge is in the interior.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334978">We are competing against inferior wood from other parts of the world. The wood is bound together with glues and resins, which are structurally as sound as our best coastal timber. The challenge we face is that we have to find higher-value products for our wood products. The industry itself is in transition. We cannot go back to the past, so we have to transition into the future.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334984">However, things were done then that are of value. There is a great story, and I would ask the member to take a look at Lax Kw'alaams, Port Simpson. It has been running a small, community-owned operative. It is putting 250 people to work on a consistent basis under the principle that we do not waste a stick of wood, under the principle of those who were guided by the elders in that first nations community that we must derive the greatest value added. </ParaText>

The large conglomerate, highly leveraged forestry companies presented a weakness when they were over-dependent on one sector, the U.S. housing market. When that leaning happened, we saw that when it fell, it fell hard. This will continue. The government must not say that rosy times are around the corner because they are not.

Interestingly enough, not only is the <Affiliation DbId="128690" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation> not going to support this important motion, which is supported by the majority of the House, but he is not defending the position of Canadians in this regard and is, in fact, supporting the position of the senators.</ParaText>

Because they want to protect their steel industry under the auspices of NAFTA. Did we have any problem with that as Canadian negotiators? Apparently not. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1334991">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today. I hope I can be heard over the roar of approval from the American southeastern softwood lumber producers as they listen to the NDP talk once again about scrapping the softwood lumber agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334992"> There are visions of prosperity going rampant down in Georgia and those southern states. Without a softwood lumber agreement, they could simply impose whatever punitive penalties they wanted on Canadian products coming across the border. Given the recession in the U.S. housing industry, those folks down there, who cheer for the NDP on a daily basis, could probably supply almost all the softwood lumber for constructing houses down there. As that cheer for the NDP gets louder about killing the softwood lumber agreement, I will try to talk about some positive things that our government is doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334993">There is no doubt that the forestry industry has some serious challenges. The member for <Affiliation DbId="128759" Type="2">Skeena—Bulkley Valley</Affiliation> did not mention that the current softwood prices are somewhere in the neighbourhood of $155, $158. Some of the mills were selling it off for $130 just to get it out of their yards. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334994">The member also knows that the break-even point is somewhere in the high three hundreds for a mill to be profitable. Yet that is fault of the Canadian government. He chooses to blame the government, not the fact that there is a recession in the U.S. The housing starts are down the tube and the price is at a point where the mills in Canada are losing money on every stick. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334995">Notwithstanding the so-called disparities in the softwood lumber agreement, about which the member talked, if the prices are at $158, no mill in Canada will make any money anyway, even if there were no tariffs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334996">The government has a role to play and Canada's recent economic action plan will help industrial sectors like the forest industry. We are investing $8.3 billion to help retrain and upgrade the skills of our workers in the forestry industry and other industries. That is our Canada skills and transition strategy to address the most pressing needs of workers who are facing layoffs so they can transition into a different type of employment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334997"> That is good news. There are $8.3 billion going into that program. The NDP does not like good news, let us remember that. Also, let us remember that NDP members have not read the budget, yet they said they would vote against it. The NDP members will vote against the $8.3 billion to retrain and help upgrade the skills of our workers in the forest industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334998">Canada's economic action plan will also temporarily provide additional support to workers and the unemployed facing transitions through some tough economic times. I am proud to talk about some of the measures we are taking. This is all good news.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1334999">Of course the NDP will not like it, but we will provide nationally the benefits for the current five week pilot project that has only been provided in the highest of unemployment areas. We have increased the duration of the EI benefits by another five weeks, raising it from 45 to 50 weeks at an estimated cost of $1.5 billion. The NDP voted against the extension of the EI program. We are not voting against it. We are supporting it. We brought it forward. That is in our budget, but the NDP does not care about that because it is good news and NDP members do not like good news.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335000">We are providing another billion dollars over two years for provinces and territories through the existing labour market development agreements for skills training. They have a closer contact with the real needs of the workers in their communities. That is good news, but the NDP is voting against that as well.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1335001">I would like to wrap up by talking about the work-sharing program. We are extending it by 14 weeks. We are allowing mills in the forestry sector that have had their work-sharing program expire to have another whole year, another 52 weeks. NDP members are voting against billions of dollars in that program as well. I would like them to tell that to the workers who are facing layoff in the forestry industry--</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1335028">The motion I have chosen to sponsor is a good example of my interest in creating bridges between the generations. I am also very pleased to have the cooperation of my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128171" Type="2">Châteauguay—Saint-Constant</Affiliation>, the Bloc Québécois critic for seniors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335029">Motion M-300 proposes some more specific amendments to the guaranteed income supplement. It is a reintroduction of Bills <Document DbId="1472125" Type="4">C-301</Document> and <Document DbId="3155919" Type="4">C-490</Document> introduced during past sessions by the Bloc Québécois. Its intention is to help our needy seniors and demonstrate our desire to improve their situation. This motion is intended as an answer to their wishes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335030">I cannot help but be delighted by the support of my motion by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128166" Type="2">Laval</Affiliation>, the Bloc Québécois critic for the status of women. We are well aware that many women are affected by the current unfairness in the guaranteed income supplement program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335031">This motion therefore proposes four different items: automatic registration for the guaranteed income supplement; a $110 per month increase for recipients of the guaranteed income supplement; full retroactivity of the guaranteed income supplement for seniors who have been short-changed; and a compensatory continuation of benefits to recipients of the guaranteed income supplement when a partner has died. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335032">The tour undertaken by my colleagues in the Bloc Québécois to consult seniors and seniors' organizations in all parts of Quebec cast light on the poverty of seniors. They asked us to pay attention to their needs, because many of them live in real poverty. The rise in the cost of living is more likely to affect seniors as they have to pay more for drugs, essential services and housing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335033">Do I really need to convince my colleagues that this money will be going to the neediest of our seniors?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335034">Our elders deserve more than the Conservatives want to give them at this time. Tax credits are all very fine, but a person has to pay income tax to be able to benefit from them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335035">For those most in need, the support measures proposed in my motion are essential, because these people cannot meet their basic needs. This is a form of isolation and social exclusion that can lead to other problems such as bad health, depression and dysfunction. There is no doubt that poverty can quickly strip people of their confidence, dignity and hope. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335036">It is not uncommon to see recipients unable to fully retire, because they need to earn some additional income just to survive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335037">I am using the term survive, because this is indeed what it is all about. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335038">By being unfair to them, the government is choking our seniors and keeping them in extreme poverty. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335039">Honouring our elders is a fundamental value in our society. We must respect these people, who worked so hard for the well-being of future generations. This is a matter of dignity, social justice, respect and, above all, rights for our elderly. Personally, I believe that this dignity begins first and foremost with financial security. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335040">For years the Bloc Québécois has been criticizing the irregularities in the federal guaranteed income supplement program, which provides supplementary income to low income seniors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335041">Over the past few years, an extensive operation carried out by the Bloc Québécois has helped track down some 42,000 of these people in Quebec. However, there are still about 135,000 seniors who are being shortchanged, including 40,000 in Quebec alone. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335042">The reason why so many seniors are not receiving the guaranteed income supplement is simply the Liberals' inaction, which is now being imitated by the Conservatives. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1335043">The government says that seniors only have to register once to get this supplement. This shows the government's ignorance of the situation and of the needs of our elderly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335044">The 135,000 people who are not getting this money are precisely those who are not aware of the existence of that program, who do not understand the application form or who cannot fill it out properly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335045">The government has an obligation to track down all those seniors who were forgotten. It must immediately set up an automatic registration system. It has the means to do so, since the exchange of information with the Canada Revenue Agency is now allowed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335046">The $110 monthly increase in the guaranteed income supplement is essential and would help our seniors improve their living conditions. Right now, the guaranteed income supplement paid to low-income pensioners does not even allow them to reach the low income cutoff. Increasing the guaranteed income supplement by $110 would help these people to at least have a revenue equivalent to the low income cutoff.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335047">In 2006, the guaranteed income supplement was increased by $18, then by $18 again in 2007 and by $16 in 2008, for a total of $52 over three years. We are definitely not talking about exceptional generosity. Do hon. members really believe that such measures will not trigger a reaction from our seniors?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335048">There is another problem: the Bloc Québécois found 42,000 people in Quebec who are entitled to the guaranteed income supplement, but they will receive only 11 months' retroactivity from the federal government. When a Canadian taxpayer ends up owing money to Revenue Canada after an audit of past tax years, the government does not settle for 11 months' retroactivity; it wants every penny it is due.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335049">I myself handled files for seniors who were being told to pay back overpayments from the department. The department has occasionally used pretty ruthless measures to recover such overpayments. But the government does not settle for 11 months' retroactivity; it collects every penny of the overpayment. That is a striking example of how the government takes advantage of the most vulnerable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335050">I should add that full retroactivity of the guaranteed income supplement would cost some $12 billion. We know that the government has recorded surpluses in the neighbourhood of $10 billion over the past few years. It might have been nice for some of that money to go to our seniors, who are becoming both more numerous and poorer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335051">It is just disgusting to see so much money spent on the military—$17.1 billion for the purchase of helicopters, planes and other equipment—on top of the billions Ottawa has given to “poor” oil companies. The Conservatives should be ashamed of their plan to reduce taxes on oil companies to 15% over the next five years, while reducing the tax rate to 22% for SMEs that have been hit hard by the economic crisis. Thanks to the government, oil companies will get $2 billion worth of tax breaks in 2009. But they do not see this as scandalous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335052">Why does the government not want to invest a little more in our seniors? Seniors' associations have also asked that guaranteed income supplement co-beneficiaries be allowed to continue collecting benefits for six months after a spouse's death. Currently, surviving spouses receive just one month of benefits after their spouse's death, which is a heavy penalty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335053">I want to make it clear that this compassionate payout will last for just six months. It is not permanent. The goal is to enable seniors going through a grieving process to create a more stable situation for themselves.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1335054">An individual who loses his or her spouse has to think about whether or not they will move or how they will maintain or keep the family home. These questions have to be asked. This compassionate measure shows a bit of humanity in dealing with our seniors. I am also convinced that my colleagues from all parties recognize our responsibility towards those who made us what we are and who expect our appreciation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335055">When in opposition, the Conservatives supported Bill <Document DbId="1472125" Type="4">C-301</Document>, which was introduced by the Bloc Québécois before the 2005 election was called. All Conservative members in this House voted for the bill. In order to demonstrate their sincerity, and thus honour the position taken previously, I urge them to support my motion now that they are in government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335056">The government can count on Quebec, which it has recognized as a nation. Members of the Bloc Québécois have known for a long time that our role is to defend the most disadvantaged. Rest assured that in a sovereign Quebec our seniors would not be penalized. The National Assembly of Quebec has adopted a unanimous motion in support of seniors who do not receive the guaranteed income supplement to which they are entitled. More than ever I will promote an independent Quebec that will respect our seniors. The guaranteed income supplement is intended for the most vulnerable. Our seniors wish to live with dignity. It is a question of social justice, rights and what is due to our seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335057">Our seniors built the Quebec of today and my generation will build the Quebec of tomorrow. These are intergenerational bridges.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="128852" Type="18">Mr. Ed Komarnicki (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development and to the Minister of Labour, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1335075">Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to hear the member speak for and against a subject that would help seniors and older workers in a number of ways that I and the hon. member have listed. It is certainly something that would have been worthy of support, but she is focused on her particular motion and I would like to speak to that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335076">I would speak in support of our public pension programs and the good work the Conservative government has been doing for some time to help seniors. Since its first day in office, our government has been absolutely committed to improving the lives of seniors. We have done that by making seniors' issues a priority and by sticking to improved programs such as the GIS the member referred to, so we can do an even better job of serving Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335077">A great deal has already been done to translate this commitment into reality. For example, since taking office we have increased the GIS by $36 per month for unattached seniors and $58 per month for couples in January 2006 and January 2007. These monthly increases to the GIS amount to a 7% increase over and above regular indexation to compensate for the increase in the average wage. The total cost of this measure alone is $2.7 billion over five years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335078">We have also increased the GIS earnings exemption from $500 to $3,500, so that many working pensioners can now keep up to an additional $1,500 in GIS benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335079">We also passed Bill <Document DbId="2521443" Type="3">C-36</Document>, legislation that makes it much easier for seniors to apply for and receive their GIS payments. This change allows seniors to make a one-time application for the GIS and receive it year over year as long as they are eligible, provided they file annual tax returns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335080">To help encourage seniors to apply for GIS benefits which they may be entitled to, we send out application forms to low-income seniors identified through the tax system. These efforts have helped to put benefits in the hands of more than 328,000 additional seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335081">For seniors who do not file income tax returns, we have undertaken aggressive targeted outreach efforts to reach seniors who may be eligible for GIS. These efforts range from setting up information booths at events to working closely with the volunteer sector and first point of contact service providers. Targeted groups include newcomers, persons with disabilities, aboriginals and the homeless. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335082">Our support for seniors has not stopped there. We have also provided more than $1 billion in tax relief each year to Canadian seniors through pension income splitting and enhancements to the age and pension income credits. This amounts to a significant amount of dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335083">More recently, through our economic action plan, we have introduced measures that will also help seniors in many additional ways. For example, we are increasing the age credit by $1,000 for 2009 and beyond to allow eligible seniors to receive up to an additional $150 in annual tax savings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335084"> We are investing an additional $60 million over three years in the targeted initiative for older workers program. We are expanding the number of potentially eligible communities to include older workers in small cities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335085">We are providing $400 million over two years through the affordable housing initiative for the construction of housing units for low-income seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335086">Canada can be proud that the poverty rate among Canadian seniors has declined dramatically over the last 25 years. In fact, the average income for seniors in that time has doubled.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335087">Canadians can also be proud that we already have one of the lowest levels of poverty among seniors of any country in the industrialized world, at around 5%. It is quite a remarkable figure. This makes us the envy of many other nations, including Sweden, the United States and the United Kingdom.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335088">That being said, there is always room for improvement. Our government will continue to work to ensure that the needs of all seniors, including low-income seniors, are adequately met.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335089">Let me turn to the motion before us today. Given the size and complexity of the GIS program, upon which many of our most vulnerable citizens depend, it is vital that each and every change being considered be examined thoroughly. Careful consideration must be given to impact and cost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335090">With that in mind, I would like to take a few moments to examine the proposals contained in today's motion and how they might affect the GIS program and the people it benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335091">To begin with, there is a proposal to increase monthly benefits by $110, a move which could cost as much as $2 billion a year. The motion also calls for unlimited GIS retroactivity which, by some estimates, could cost as much as $3 billion. These two measures alone would cost several billions of dollars. We are talking about huge sums of money, especially given the economic times we are living in right now. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="25">(1825)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1335092">It is important to note that GIS benefits are already paid retroactively for up to one year. The current one year retroactivity provision is at least on par with, and in some cases superior to, retroactivity provisions for similar programs in other Canadian and international jurisdictions. For example, retroactivity provisions for the Alberta seniors benefit, British Columbia's senior's supplement, and Ontario's guaranteed annual income system allow for a one year retroactivity limit. This is also the case for the Canada pension plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335093">The current one year retroactivity provision contained in the OAS act is even more generous than similar programs in other countries. For example, Australia's age pension, New Zealand's superannuation and Sweden's guaranteed old age pension provision provide for no retroactivity. Social assistance programs such as Alberta works, Nova Scotia's income assistance program and Ontario works also have no retroactivity provisions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335094">In this regard, I would like to point out that the previous Liberal government was in agreement with this particular point. Here is what the Liberal member for <Affiliation DbId="128273" Type="2">Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine</Affiliation>, on November 18, 2005, had to say on this issue:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335095">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">With respect to retroactivity, I think it is more important that this program be totally consistent with existing provincial income supplementation programs. On the issue of retroactivity for one year, there is no discrepancy between this program and the provincial programs, which are income supplementation, security or support programs.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335096">It is also very important to note that full retroactivity could also mean increased costs to the provinces and territories whose income supplement programs are based on eligibility for the GIS.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335097">All that said, we must keep in mind that there are already two exceptions when retroactive payments can be made beyond one year: first, when the applicant would have been incapable of expressing the intent to apply for benefits; and second, when an administrative error has occurred or erroneous advice was given.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335098">This motion also proposes paying six months of a deceased person's pension to the survivor. While this proposal seems reasonable at first glance, it is important to note that the GIS is already adjusted for changes in family status following the death of a partner since many low income seniors become eligible for GIS or an increase in that supplement due to the fact that they are now single income individuals. Furthermore, both the Canada and Quebec pension plans contain survivor benefit provisions that help seniors in such situations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335099">Last but not least, this motion proposes eliminating the requirement to apply for GIS benefits, which is also difficult since the information available from the Canada Revenue Agency is often insufficient to determine eligibility. In this regard, the former Liberal member for Ahuntsic and former parliamentary secretary to the minister of social development said that doing away with the application process would:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335100">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">--unreasonably burden the governmental retirement system administratively, technically and financially...Without the application process and income verification, the system would be open to abuse. In addition, we would not have enough information to determine entitlement for seniors who, for instance, do no file tax returns. This would also substantially increase the risk of errors within the system.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335101">Those words are from a Liberal predecessor of mine on this very topic. These comments were made in this House on October 24, 2005. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335102">The onus for making an application must continue to rest with the applicant. Thankfully, as I have mentioned, due to the actions of this government, our seniors now only have to apply once for the GIS benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335103">For the reasons I have outlined, we cannot support this motion. While the proposals are well intentioned and we cannot disagree with the intent of the motion, the reality is that implementing these measures would require enormous financial investments and would have widespread ramifications and implications for other government programs, both at the federal and provincial levels. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335104">As such, I would urge all members of this House to work with the government as we continue to ensure that our policies, programs and services meet the needs of Canada's seniors in a responsible manner. We will continue to do that and we will continue to look at ways to enhance their benefits. It must be at a progressive rate and at a time that the government decides.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335105">Therefore, I would ask members not to support this motion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1335106">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak to Motion No. 300, an extremely important motion that has been put forward. I know everyone in the House cares a lot about seniors. We are very concerned with how they are aging and whether or not they are receiving sufficient support. Granted, there are some that do because they have private pensions and lots of support, but there are others like those my hon. colleague referred to who do not have that kind of support system and need to rely more and more on government support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335107">For the viewers who are watching, I would like to read the motion. It says:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335108">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That, in the opinion of this House, the government should as soon as possible introduce a bill providing: a 110 dollar monthly increase in the guaranteed income supplement paid to pensioners; the continuation of the payment, for a period of six months, of the old age security pension and supplement to a person whose spouse or common-law partner has died; automatic registration for people 65 entitled to the guaranteed income supplement; full retroactivity of the guaranteed income supplement for seniors who have been short-changed.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335109">There are a many things in this motion and clearly the member is very concerned about a variety of areas. She certainly tried to cover them all in one motion, which I think will be quite complex and difficult to deal with in its entirety. It would be an interesting thing to have a study and see where it all fits. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335110">For the people watching at home who are trying to understand how the House of Commons processes work, M-300 is only a motion. It is a general expression of desires and intents. It is not a bill and would never become a bill. It would never become a law unless the government chose to introduce it as such and that is the core point of the motion. It is asking the government to introduce a bill that would increase all of the areas I have referred to. If this motion were to pass and as time passes, it would not actually force the government to do anything. I say this just so we are honest and not misleading those who are watching to think that if the government were to do this, we would suddenly get all those increases. It does not quite work that simply. This is just the beginning of a process, asking the government to introduce a bill that would do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335111">Seniors across Canada need and deserve our help to ensure their dignity and quality of life, especially in these tough economic times. My colleagues and I are committed, and I believe we are all committed in the House, to working very hard on behalf of Canada's seniors. We will strive to protect their pensions and invest in their well-being to our greatest possible extent. The Liberal Party has a strong record of enhancing benefits for seniors. We know that seniors need and deserve our help to ensure their health, security, dignity and quality of life. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335112">When I go back to my riding every weekend, I end up meeting with lots of seniors and talking to them about a variety of issues. I rarely fail to hear about how difficult it is to manage. I asked a question in the House today on behalf of Mario, one of my constituents, who called and said that his property taxes, hydro and gas bills are going up. He asked me how he was supposed to pay all of these bills. His pension is not going up. If it goes up 1.2% or whatever the cost of living is, that clearly is not enough to offset the many expenses that he is trying to deal with. Of course, seniors are going to come to their parliamentarians or elected officials and ask for help because they cannot manage on whatever they have in their savings plus their pensions and the GIS. It is not enough. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335113">Hence, the motion I am speaking to today again tries to address many of those needs that I expect my colleague has heard in her own riding while talking to her own constituents. In doing a bit of an analysis on this motion, it looks like it would cost well in excess of $1.5 billion over the current budget. As much as we would like to do a lot of things, I think we have to be practical and reasonable in many aspects of looking at these things.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1335114">The Bloc members will never be in government so they can introduce, say and ask anything they want. They do form a very useful purpose at times by flagging issues. They are raising issues of concern and it is our job to respond in the appropriate way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335115">At this particular time, when we are dealing with a recession, it would be extremely difficult, I would suggest, to find $1.5 billion, if not an extra $2 billion to meet the needs no matter how much someone would want to do that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335116">Clearly, the motion could be referred to the human resources committee that would take a detailed look at just how we could more effectively benefit our seniors. Whether it was with this motion or in some other way, I think it is probably something that all of us would like to see done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335117"> I have talked to some of the members of the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons With Disabilities and they have indicated their desire to look more intently on just what seniors are receiving and what we might be able to do to assist them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335118">We certainly would have preferred it if the Conservatives had not spent the cupboard bare with their previous budgets and their fall economic and fiscal updates, eliminating the rainy day fund that we always had there for difficult times. It would have been helpful if that had been there, but it is not there any longer and we have to deal with what we have to deal with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335119">The previous Liberal government made great progress for Canada's seniors. Our constant goal was to enhance the quality of life for all seniors. We must always remember that this great country we live in was built by seniors that we have today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335120">I am currently the critic for veterans as well as seniors and pensions. Talking to many of these veterans has been quite an experience, listening to the stories they tell me, and being reminded about just who built this country that we get to enjoy and that we will leave for our grandchildren to enjoy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335121">In the last Liberal budget 2005, we had many great initiatives for Canadian seniors. Our budget made significant investments in seniors' programs from health care to income security, from retirement savings to assistance for caregivers. That is another very important area that needs some serious attention from the government as well. We have an aging population and more and more caregivers are also struggling themselves. We need to be addressing that area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335122">The guaranteed income supplement provides low income seniors with a benefit that ensures a basic level of income throughout their retirement years. In 2004 the Liberal government made a commitment to increase the guaranteed income supplement by $1.5 billion over the next five years. However, budget 2005 went above and beyond that commitment. We announced that we would increase the guaranteed income supplement benefits for low income seniors not by $1.5 billion but by $2.7 billion over two years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335123">It was a period of good economic times. We were managing the country well. The economy was strong and we had surpluses. We chose to turn around and put that surplus toward seniors, so that they would have the benefits and we would assist their lives and make their quality of life a little more comfortable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335124">Seniors are and want to remain very active members of our society. We introduced the new horizons program, which had been a program around 10 years ago that was reintroduced by the Liberals in order to provide opportunities to make sure that seniors were having the opportunity to get out to exercise and socialize. A big important part of wellness is the ability to be out and interact with other people, attend bingo games and card games. I visit my riding frequently and visit the seniors who seem to be having the time of their lives, going on trips and enjoying themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335125">That budget also provided $13 million over five years to establish a new national seniors secretariat, so that we could focus more on just exactly what was going on with seniors. They continue to be very concerned about pensions, about the health care system, pharmacare, housing, and many of the difficulties that people face that are on a fixed income. Our government clearly was committed to all of these things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335126">In closing, the Liberal Party remains steadfast in our support for our seniors and ensuring the best quality of life possible for them. I would hope that our human resources committee is able to study some of these very issues. </ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335131">The motion also asks that the government make automatic the registration for people 65 years of age who are entitled to the guaranteed income supplement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335132">Last, it asks that the government make a fully retroactive payment of guaranteed income supplement for seniors who have been previously shortchanged.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335133">Of course, such requests as those contained in the motion are very much in keeping with the NDP's ongoing work to improve the lives of seniors. For that reason, I am pleased to support such a motion designed to enhance the income security of Canada's poorest seniors. In fact, the motion is more or less in line with the policies the NDP has been arguing for, for years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335134"> The reality facing our country is that our seniors are finding it increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to make ends meet. They do not just worry about their retirement incomes. They are the fastest growing group of Canadians living in poverty. Even though our seniors built this country, people who should be our country's heroes in so many ways, today far too many of these seniors suffer silently, living lives of poverty and neglect, neglected by their own federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335135">In fact, that is how it was put to me recently by a delegation of prominent seniors who visited my office. They said that it was as if seniors were invisible to this country. They have worked hard all of their lives and have played by the rules but now, with every bill they open, they are paying more and getting less.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335136">International Woman's Day was marked just last Sunday. I find it more than ironic that it is older women who are hit the hardest during these uncertain times. Low income rates among senior women remain more than double those of senior men: 3% of men and 7% of women. As women tend to live longer than men, it is unattached senior women who suffer most of all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335137">I will paint a picture cobbled together by research from Statistics Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335138">First, if we take the maximum amount available to a senior from old age security and combine that with the maximum guaranteed income supplement, we are still well below the after-tax low-income cutoff. These programs provided almost one-third of the income of senior women in 2003. Older women tend to have incomes lower than men because they participated less in the paid labour force and, if they were employed, their wages, on average, were less.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335139">The Conservatives talk about choice for women to stay home and raise their children but then they are penalized when they do so. In 2004, about one in five women had never worked outside the home. Further and again, as women live longer, they are at greater risk of running out of savings in their lifetime. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335140">According to a 2006 study, senior women suffer much more financially from widowhood than senior men. Over a 10 year period, senior widows saw their income decrease in the five years after the death of their husband. Over the same period, widowers' incomes actually increased in the five years after the loss of their wife.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335141"> In 2005, it was estimated that the incomes of unattached, low income older women were, on average, about $2,220 below the after-tax low-income cutoff. In 2004, the mean before-tax income of women over 65 was 67% of men. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335142">Women tend to receive lower CPP benefits because of their historically low earnings and because the majority of Canadians do not have a workplace pension plan. The types of jobs women do and the lack of pension coverage make it difficult for women who work throughout their lives to accumulate retirement incomes and to provide a secure financial future for themselves. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="45">(1845)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1335143">The 2001 Seniors in Canada Report Card published by the National Advisory Council on Aging identified the economic status of unattached seniors, particularly women, as the area where priority action was needed. Five years later, despite a minor increase in their incomes, the 2006 report card shows that unattached women are still very much at risk of living in poverty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335144">Moreover, low income seniors must deal with a convoluted maze of uncoordinated federal, provincial and territorial programs. On top of this, seniors also face the clawbacks associated with GIS. This is something I hear from my constituents in my office in <Affiliation DbId="128487" Type="2">Hamilton East—Stoney Creek</Affiliation>. A slight increase in income can affect GIS and other benefits and increase costs and taxes for low income seniors. If a person receiving the GIS cashes a $1,000 RRSP, the individual could see her GIS benefits reduced by up to $500. If the person is among the 50% of GIS recipients who pay income tax, she could pay a further $250 in income tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335145">Furthermore, other provincially and territorially administered benefits face the possibility of being reduced and/or being eliminated altogether. In the worst case scenario, small increases in income outside of these programs could very well result in a net loss of income for the senior.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335146">In effect, low income seniors are trapped. Because of this tangled web of disincentives, they are actively discouraged from earning additional income to make their lives more enjoyable. Moreover, and with respect to this motion, I am often asked by seniors why they are not automatically registered for GIS. Qualifying for old age security means people already meet the income requirements for GIS and yet they must apply for the latter to receive it. Every July, people who have not reapplied for their GIS benefit are suspended from receiving those benefits until renewal applications are completed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335147">In 2005, and I am borrowing data again from the National Advisory Council on Aging, there were approximately 115,000 late applicants for GIS. The council believes that most of this benefit bottleneck can be accounted for because seniors are not renewing the GIS on time. Approximately 138,000 seniors who qualify for GIS do not receive it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335148">This will simply not do. It makes sense that seniors who are eligible for the benefit should automatically be registered for it. The income security system for seniors is difficult enough to negotiate as it is and seniors do not need yet another form to fill out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335149">The motion before us today solves this problem by automatically registering seniors for GIS and by providing full retroactivity with respect to the payments they have missed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335150"> In keeping with the spirit of the motion being debated, I would like to conclude with the following message. I and the NDP believe passionately that no senior should live in poverty. Accordingly, we would like to see the combined GIS and OAS benefits increased so that they are equal to or greater than the low income cutoff. We also believe that the clawbacks associated with GIS should be eliminated immediately. In addition, we would like to see better coordination of provincial, federal and territorial programs. To better protect unattached senior women, we also would like to see an automatic and compulsory sharing of pension rights under CPP, employer pension funds and retirement savings plans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335151">We, in this Parliament, must ensure that all of our seniors have the financial support they need to live dignified, independent lives free from the scourge of poverty. We must take every opportunity to enhance their income security. This motion is a very good step in that direction and I thank the member opposite for tabling the motion here today.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1335152">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today about the motion that my colleague was generous enough to move. I am here in this House this afternoon and I have been listening to the debate from both sides. People are talking about money, values, costs. I have a bit of difficulty with that. I would like, for one moment, maybe for the 10 minutes that I have, to talk about the seniors we represent, who are probably the most vulnerable people in this country. We have an aging population and 38% of seniors are over 75.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335153">People who are over 75 sometimes have difficulty knowing how to organize their affairs, and more importantly, they are often too proud or too ashamed to ask for help from anyone at all. In the case of people over 75, the husband was probably employed somewhere that did not have a pension plan. Perhaps their children have even passed away before them, since their children's lives were very different from their own, and they have probably been left to take care of themselves. They are very proud and have learned to get by their entire lives. Indeed, in the case of people over 75, they survived the first great depression, which lasted from 1929 to 1940. So, for someone who has lived through that and managed to feed their family, feed their children, send them to school, clothe them, and so on, those people might think they do not need much to survive. So they are content with very little and they often manage to make do without asking for the things they do not have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335154">I was listening earlier as the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128115" Type="2">York West</Affiliation> and the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128607" Type="2">Souris—Moose Mountain</Affiliation> were talking about the votes that took place previously in this House. It is true that three years ago—I hope the hon. members will recall—when the Liberals were still in power, a unanimous vote was passed in this House on a similar motion granting seniors the guaranteed income supplement, that is, what was owing to them, with full retroactivity, which was to be followed by automatic registration. At that time, we did not even fully understand just how disadvantaged our seniors have become and we had not yet asked for the additional $110 a month. I am pleased we are doing so now. This came as a result of our visits with seniors, when we began to understand their needs and what we could do to help them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335155">They are talking big bucks but how much, exactly? In the morning papers there was a reference to $525 million for a project having to do with a defence communication system and they were not even certain of the results. The amount of $291 million had already been spent and according to the reports the results were not convincing so far. That means $816 millions have been spent for nothing, yet they are getting upset about a few billions for people who have given everything for their country, many of whom went off to war between 1939 and 1945, and some of whom now have children or grandchildren off fighting in Afghanistan, people who have helped build the economy of this country and make it strong, even though they earned very little. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335156">I have trouble understanding how they can confuse the issue and say that the Bloc Québécois can ask for things but will never do anything. I would point out to my colleagues that every time the Bloc Québécois has asked for something, every time it has invested efforts in finances, it always got answers. I can assure the House that it is not because the Bloc Québécois will never be in government that it does not know how to make decisions relating to finances and to the people it represents.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="55">(1855)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1335157">We have always been extremely painstaking in ensuring that the money was there to do what we were asking for. For our colleagues over the way, it is a big deal to give $1.5 billion to deserving seniors, but no big deal at all to allow companies to put money into tax havens and never see a cent of tax from it. There is a big difference between allowing the oil companies to not pay billions in taxes and giving, or not giving, $1.5 billion to deserving seniors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335158">What kind of a society do we live in if we think like that? We are in a recession and so it would not be possible to provide our parents with food, to give them what they need? The government has decided it needed to provide tax credits. When people do not have to pay income tax, they get no tax credits. Is that clear? Seniors receiving the guaranteed income supplement will never get tax credits, unless they go back to work, as the government seems to want them to. At age 75, they might have a few more years of work left in them, mightn't they? At $7 an hour, I am sure our seniors could make a lot of money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335159">It is inconceivable that this government should want to spend so much money on defence, deprive itself of so much money from the oil companies and allow companies to use tax havens when we need this money to help the most vulnerable members of our society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335160">During the most recent election campaign, I visited seniors' residences, as I always do. I will always remember one evening. When I left after dinner, a very stoic woman was waiting for me at the door to the building. She was clean and well dressed and was standing waiting to hand me an envelope. Naturally, I did not want to read the letter in front of this person, so I went to my car, where I opened the envelope and read the letter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335161">This person was asking what I, as a member of Parliament, could do for her. She had had nothing to eat in her refrigerator for two weeks. She was eating only bread and peanut butter. She was asking what I could do for her. She does not get enough money from the guaranteed income supplement. Her pension cheque, which usually goes up every July, had not gone up. It usually increases every three months, but it had not increased. Her rent, like all rent, had gone up. The extra $16 she was getting did not even cover her rent increase.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335162">What do we do in this case? Do we take money out of our own pockets and give it to her? I am sure that there are at least 25, 50 or 100 people in my riding who are in the same situation. Of course, I directed this woman to agencies that could help her, but it still took several days before she got any help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335163">Is it right to leave people 80 or older broke like that, without anything to eat? Is it right to leave them to commit suicide? At present, 40% of suicides are committed by people over 50. In 2006 alone, 453 out of 1,136 suicides were committed by seniors. We need to think about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335164">The motion my colleague has put forward today would enable seniors to live better, with respect and dignity. It would not make them wealthy. We live much better than that ourselves. I hope my colleagues will think about that when they vote on the motion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1335167">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to contribute to the debate on Motion No. 300, which purposes that the government introduce legislation to make amendments to the Old Age Security Act with respect to the guaranteed income supplement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335168">We all share the aim of doing all we can to help our country's seniors enjoy a better quality of life. It is only because of our seniors' long years of sacrifice and hard labour that we live in such a prosperous and successful country today. There is no question the entire nation owes them a debt of gratitude.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335169"> That is why since 2006, our government has acted decisively on its commitment to protect the security of Canadian seniors and to help increase their quality of life. One need look no further for evidence of this commitment than our efforts to reduce poverty among seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335170">Thanks to our government's continued and increased investments, Canada is recognized as a global leader in alleviating poverty among seniors, with one of the lowest levels of poverty among the elderly of any country in the industrialized world. As recently as 1980, more than 21% of older Canadians lived below the poverty line. By 2006, that figure was less than 6%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335171"> That being said, there is always room for improvement. Our government will continue to work to ensure that the needs of all seniors, including low income seniors, are adequately met.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335172"> I remind the House that since taking office, our government has increased the GIS by 7% over and above regular indexation to compensate for the increase in the average wage. The total cost of this investment for low-income seniors is $2.7 billion over five years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335173">As many seniors continue to work, we have also increased the GIS earnings exemption from $500 to $3,500 per year. This means that a single pensioner earning $3,500 or more is now able to keep up to an additional $1,500 in annual GIS benefits.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1335179">I told him that he got a lot of people's hopes up when he came to Quebec in January to meet members of the cultural community. They said that he was a good listener. On February 2, the very day of my question, <I>Le Devoir</I> reported that the minister pulled the wool over everyone's eyes, because he had not restored the $5 million he cut, without reason, for foreign tours by artists. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335180">I asked the minister to admit that he was trying to make something new out of something old because most of the money he was announcing—and that he continues to announce—will go to extending existing programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335181">I want to talk about the Trade Routes program because it has to do with the second part of my question. I asked him to restore the program that made it possible for artists—in the performing arts and also more literary arts, such as writers—to present their cultural works abroad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335182">Trade Routes is a comprehensive trade development program specifically designed for Canada's arts and cultural sector. The program helps profit and not-for-profit organizations in the arts and cultural sector prepare to export and sell their products and services in international markets. In particular, the program offers access to market research, trade experts in Canada and abroad, and financial support. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335183">Trade Routes helps profit and not-for-profit organizations in the arts and cultural sector, in the areas of crafts, design, film and television, heritage, new media, performing arts, publishing, sound recording and visual arts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335184">The program usually has a budget of nearly $8 million. Of that, close to $3 million—$2.7 million or $2.8 million, to be precise—goes directly to artists, theatre and dance companies, and the other $5 million goes to cultural attachés. That is why, during yesterday's meeting of the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage, I had a question for Alain Paré, president of the International Exchange for the Performing Arts (CINARS), who is keenly aware of the program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335185">He said that Heritage Canada's trade commissioners, who suck up $5 million of PromArt's $8 million allocation, were seen as duplicating the work of cultural attachés already working in embassies, people we could easily do without. However, we still have to figure out how to get that $3 million back. Artists really need that money, as well as the PromArt money, to perform and exhibit abroad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335186">I would truly like to know if the minister intends to find a solution so that Quebec's arts and culture sector will not be stifled.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1335187">Mr. Speaker, we have worked very hard to help the member through the very significant investments we are making. Apparently the member and her colleagues have no interest in reading the budget or in looking into the very significant investments we are making in the arts. The member specifically referenced travel abroad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335188">Her constituents and the constituents of the Bloc in Quebec should know that the Bloc has voted against budget 2009. Budget 2009, Canada's economic action plan, contains $276 million in new money, but of course that is not all of the money for the arts. The $276 million is new money. The member is unaware that there is $276 million in new money. There is $540 million in total, of which $276 million is new. It will go to help ridings from coast to coast and it will support the arts from coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335189">The member referenced international travel. The member should know, and in fact artists know, that we have increased the funding to the Canada Council for the Arts up to $181 million. That is a 17% increase. That was a fund of just $100 million only a few short years ago. It is now $181 million, thanks to the leadership of our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, our <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister </Affiliation> and our great new young <Affiliation DbId="128706" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Heritage and Official Languages</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335190">Everywhere he goes, artists from coast to coast, after meeting the <Affiliation DbId="128706" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Heritage and Official Languages</Affiliation>, are very impressed with his leadership and his direction. People are very excited about where he is taking this file and about the progressive nature of the way we are taking this file.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335191">Canadian culture is a world-leading export for Canada, but it is also something we are proud to promote right here in Canada. That is why we have invested $100 million for summer festivals. Those summer festivals will occur from coast to coast in this great country, from north to south and from east to west, and we will be behind those festivals. We are also behind so many things that the artists are doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335192">I want to go back to the Canada Council for the Arts for one moment. The investment we have made there has increased to $181 million, $13 million of which they are spending on international travel, but the balance remaining, $168 million, is going to artists right here. They are investing it right here, in artists and in arts and culture right here. That is artists helping artists, and our government is standing behind the Canada Council. We are backing them up. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335193">The Bloc is voting against the Canada Council, and I would like to repeat that statement for the people in Quebec, because the Bloc does not run anywhere else. The Bloc has voted against increases in funding for the Canada Council for the Arts. The Bloc Québécois has voted against increases in arts and culture, and it campaigns as a party that supports arts and culture. Well, the Bloc cannot support arts and culture in Quebec and come to Ottawa and vote against funding increases for the Canada Council and so many other things, such as summer festivals. The member should apologize to the arts and culture community in Quebec for consistently voting against its interests.</ParaText>

The Conservatives, on the other hand, are at only 10% in Quebec. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335195">Everything he said is true. All the numbers he gave are more or less accurate, but there are gaping holes nonetheless. Artists are missing a portion of their funding, because the Conservative government took it away from them. Artists are missing the financial assistance that allowed them to tour and present their work abroad. In that regard, $7 million is missing: $4 million for PromArt and $3 million for Trade Routes. That is how much money is missing at this time, funding that allowed our artists to tour abroad. There are no existing programs that provide sufficient subsidies to allow them to tour abroad.</ParaText>

The Bloc Québécois members voted against that, and they stand here trying to confuse the issue, trying to cloud the issue, trying to misrepresent what the government is doing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335199">The government can stand proud on what it is doing with heritage. It can stand proud on arts and culture, because no government in the history of Canada has ever been more supportive.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1335200">Mr. Speaker, in budget 2006, the Conservative government announced $400 million to address the long- and short-term impacts of the pine beetle infestation; to strengthen the long-term competitiveness of the forestry sector in Canada; to support worker adjustment for the changing economy and to build new economies; to expand market opportunities for Canadian forest products; and to identify and address essential skills and adjustments for older and laid-off forestry workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335201">Yet, in the same budget year, 2006-07, none of the $400 million was spent. In 2007-08, $112 million was spent. In 2008-09, $74 million was spent. The total spent is about $185 million out of a promised package of $400 million. Since then, things have worsened in the forestry industry not only in B.C. but across Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335202">In the period 2006 to 2008, the forestry industry suffered because of a drop in the U.S. housing construction market. It has suffered because of the poor softwood lumber agreement with the U.S. The Conservative government left $1 billion on the table out of a $4 billion deal negotiated by a Liberal government. The price of lumber dropped 40%. Two hundred and seven mills were closed across Canada and 38,000 jobs were lost in that time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335203"> Pulp and paper companies began to lose money and prices for pulp and paper fell by 20%, during which time the money still was not flowing. Canadian companies lost $529 million U.S. in the final quarter of 2008. Costs and charges came to $292 million in 2008 compared to $30 million the year before. The government sat on its hands and spent only $180 million over two years. A year after the money was promised, nothing had flowed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335204">Three hundred rural and remote communities in Canada depend on forestry. In those towns, workers have suffered. I can speak specifically to B.C. towns that depended on forestry, such as Mackenzie, where people began to lose their jobs. Fifteen hundred forestry workers depended on that mill for their jobs. When the mill closed, 4,500 people who were depending on getting that money had to wait for it. In the meantime, the government still did nothing. First nations communities in the west that rely on forestry waited for the pledged money. They worried about how to harvest dead wood killed by the pine beetle. They worried about fires in summer. They waited for that economic help, but it did not come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335205">In the meantime, insult was added to injury. The same B.C. communities of aboriginal people waited for two years to meet with the former minister of natural resources, who himself is a British Columbian. With tens of thousands of lies, $1 billion in infrastructure under threat from the pine beetle and the enhanced threat of wildfires, the chief of the B.C. first nations community said, “Our community needs this funding now”, yet the long-awaited stimulus package did not come until a year later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335206">What bothers me is the callous disregard shown to the real people whose lives are being damaged and the broken promise, the smoke and mirrors of putting money into a budget only to watch it disappear into some mysterious black hole. That is what galls me the most. The government seems to toy with the lives of people and does not care.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1335207">Mr. Speaker, those are pretty strong accusations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335208">As I said earlier today, we are saddened by the job losses that have taken place across this country. We are saddened by communities that are under the gun because of those job losses. But mostly, I am saddened when we see people trying to make political gain out  of other people's misery. I would suggest that is what is happening again here tonight with the member opposite because I have heard nothing from her over the last year on this file. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335209">I have been on the natural resources committee for a year and a half and I never heard a complaint from her until the last month when she began to think she can start to get some political mileage out of this issue. We heard nothing from her last year when the committee did its work and came up with a unanimous report which contained a number of the issues that the government has adopted in the economic plan of 2009. We heard nothing from her this spring when we were asking for budget input. She said nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335210">I should point out that the community development trust, last year, delivered $120 million to British Columbia for its forestry sector. That is a significant amount of money. Where was she when we were travelling the country this spring? We heard nothing from her on this issue. We are not dealing with this file because of politics; we are dealing with this file because we care. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335211">We have put forward a plan and I am glad to see that she and her party are going to support it, but rather than criticizing us, perhaps she should be promoting what it is we are doing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335212">I want to talk a bit about the integrated approach that we have toward the forestry sector. It involves workers, technology, markets, companies and communities. I do not think I have enough time this afternoon go to through all of those things, but I will try to touch on a few of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335213">In terms of companies, we have made some significant differences. We are providing access to credit. If people had been listening earlier to the debate, they would have heard some of the details. Last year in EDC's portfolio $14 billion out of $80 billion was targeted toward the forestry sector. We have improved  work share programs in an attempt to give companies a chance to stabilize themselves and their workforces. We have accelerated the CCA, the capital cost allowance, which was asked of us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335214">In terms of communities, we provided $1 billion to the community development trust last year. As I mentioned, $120 million of that went to British Columbia. This year there is another $1 billion in the community adjustment fund to help communities deal with the economic situation they find themselves in. We have delivered, as she pointed out, $200 million to deal with the pine beetle situation in communities that have been so devastated by it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335215">In terms of workers, we provided $8.3 billion for skills training and transition. That includes things like the work share program and the extension of EI benefits. We travelled across this country and asked people what they wanted. One of things they told us they wanted was EI benefits extended. This government listened to those consultations and put that in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335216">We have gone around the world trying to develop markets. We put $50 million this year into market development. We put money into future technology. I do not have time to talk about all of that, but one of the great things in place is forest products innovations and the difference that it is making in new technologies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335217">We have consulted with our stakeholders and listened to the concerns of Canadians. The budget initiatives that we are planning will lead to a strong and competitive tomorrow while looking out for the needs of citizens today.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1335218">Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask, where was this member while the government was travelling in the spring of 2009? B.C. MPs met with the forestry sector communities in British Columbia in the spring of 2008. I personally travelled during the summers of 2007 and 2008 to meet with the people in the communities where the mills were closing down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335219">I was there. I was there over the last two years, listening and speaking to the people in those communities. In the spring of 2000 I met with the BC First Nations Forestry Council. That is where I learned that it had been trying to meet for two years with the Minister of Natural Resources and could not get a meeting with the B.C. minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335220">I am not speaking on my own. This is something that has been going on. We have watched this demise since 2005, when the Liberal government put $100 million into this community. In 2006 the Conservative government promised it and did not do it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335221">I can tell the member where I was.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1335222">Mr. Speaker, I do not know if the House remembers the complete mess the forestry industry was in when the Conservative government took over. If members are familiar with it at all, they will know that we brought in the softwood lumber agreement, which actually brought stability to this industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335223">The member's party across the way was in government for years and could not resolve that issue. It allowed $4.5 billion to $5 billion of Canadian money to be tied up in the United States. It would have been tied up there forever if the Liberals had stayed in power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1335224"> The best thing to happen was the Conservative government coming into power. We were able to deal with the softwood lumber agreement. We were able to bring in packages both last year and this year to deal with the forestry crisis. We will continue to work with the industry and other governments. We will get the job done for Canadians and for forestry communities.</ParaText>
