              <Affiliation DbId="128857" Type="18">Mr. Dave MacKenzie (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Safety, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1393431">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in the House today in support of Bill <Document DbId="3727297" Type="3">C-18</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393432">As hon. members may know, I spent 30 years as a member of the police department of Woodstock, Ontario. I entered as a constable and retired from the force as chief of police. The well-being of Canada's police officers is a subject near and dear to my own heart.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393433">What we have before us is a matter of unfinished business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393434"> This bill proposes certain technical amendments to the RCMP Superannuation Act which would improve pension portability; in other words, transferring the value of benefits earned under a former plan to a new one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393435">The act was first amended in 1999, with the same intent. However, when work began on drafting the enabling regulations, it was learned the legislative changes did not go far enough. This bill would close those gaps. Once implemented through regulation, these amendments would modernize the RCMP Superannuation Act and bring it in line with the federal public service pension plan and other plans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393436">Specifically, Bill <Document DbId="3727297" Type="3">C-18</Document> would do three things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393437">First, it would support Parliament's 1999 intention to expand existing provisions for election of prior service. Currently, members of the RCMP pension plan can transfer credits for prior service with a police force that was absorbed by the RCMP, with the Canadian Forces, with the Public Service of Canada, with the Senate, or with the House of Commons. Under new provisions, eligible members could elect to purchase credits from other Canadian pension plans; a municipal or provincial police force, for instance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393438">Second, is the matter of pension transfer arrangements that the amended superannuation act would support. As we know, a pension transfer agreement is typically a formal arrangement between two employers. It would allow a plan member to increase pensionable service by directly transferring the actuarial value of benefits earned under a previous plan to a new one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393439">Last, the bill contains other related amendments that would clarify and improve some administrative and eligibility aspects of the act. For example, it would validate certain historical calculations related to part-time employment and the cost of elections for prior service with a police force that was taken over by the RCMP. It would also better protect pension eligibility for those transferring benefits from the public service, the Canadian Forces, or for retired senators and members of Parliament who continue their career with the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393440">Greater fairness and flexibility in RCMP superannuation are important considerations. They are important benefits that this bill would deliver.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393441">Like pretty much all employers in the country, the RCMP faces an aging workforce and stiff competition from other employers seeking to attract the best and brightest to their ranks. Somewhere around 700 members are retiring each year from the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393442">To replace retiring members and meet operational requirements in the future, the RCMP must attract and train a record number of recruits for the next few years. This is another area where improved pension portability may be important, especially when it comes to the recruitment of lateral troops. These are officers with at least two years' service, typically with a municipal or provincial force, who have decided to continue their careers with the RCMP. As such, their training is much shorter than that of regular cadets, at just five weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393443">The idea is to leverage the experience of lateral entrants to quickly develop fully trained police officers who are ready to take up their duties upon arrival in detachment. Once they are there, they require far less supervision by experienced officers, known as field coaches, than brand new constables. That frees up more resources for policing our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393444">Lateral entrants represent just a fraction of the cadets who graduate from the RCMP's training facility each year, roughly 3% or 4%, so we are not talking large numbers. However, at a time of attrition and an increasingly complex and challenging security environment, the RCMP needs all the personnel it can get. Pension portability can help attract experienced officers through the door.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393445">In fact, I hold in my hand excerpts from the 2005 report of the Auditor General of Canada. In it, the Auditor General notes that the cost of training a regular cadet is about $30,000, compared to $2,000 for a lateral entry. Of the lateral entry program, the report states: “--this program is not attractive to potential employees as they cannot transfer their pension contributions to the RCMP pension plan”. All of that would change under the proposed amendments before the House today.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1393446">The RCMP Depot is currently capable of training up to 90 lateral entrants a year divided into three troops of 30, but up to now a typical lateral troop contains only about 16 entrants. We believe pension portability has a lot to do with that as, again, it is available right now only to former military police who are covered by the federal Canadian Forces Superannuation Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393447">I would also like to note that pension portability as it pertains to transfer agreements is a two-way street. RCMP members may occasionally seek employment with other agencies and organizations, for example, when a family relocates to a new community. If a transfer agreement is in place between the two organizations, then members can take their prior service with them as credit toward pension benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393448">Mobility and flexibility within Canada's security community is a good thing. It benefits the safety of all Canadians and today's generation of employees want options, opportunities and recognition for their good work. This kind of flexibility is already reflected in the pension plans of other federal workers, so I think it only fair that the RCMP members enjoy the same treatment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393449">It is important to take every reasonable opportunity to support recruitment to our national police force and the well-being and morale of its members. The House saw fit once already in the past to make the legislative adjustments it believed would facilitate greater pension portability to RCMP superannuation, but we have since learned those changes fell short of what was required to put enabling regulations in place to make it all happen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393450">Let us do it now and not a moment too soon. I call on all hon. members to support the RCMP by supporting Bill <Document DbId="3727297" Type="3">C-18</Document>.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1393451">Mr. Speaker, certainly the Liberal Party will be supporting the passage of this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393452">I thank the hon. member for his speech. It was a useful speech to frame the debate. This is essentially a transfer agreement among various pension plans so that the RCMP is treated in the same fashion as are other people in the civil service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393453">There was a question, it seems to me, that arose a few years ago about when an RCMP officer went to a place like Haiti or Afghanistan, and worked there for a period of time and whether he or she would receive pension credits while serving outside of the country. I wonder if the hon. member could clarify that and whether it has in fact been addressed in the bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393454">I understand the inter-transferability between the Canadian Forces and the RCMP. What would be other examples where this proposal would benefit the RCMP from, say, other non-police forces? The hon. member is a former police officer. If he ceased to be a member of the House of Commons, would his pension credits generated here be receivable in an RCMP pension plan in the event that he went back to the RCMP?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393455">These are the kinds of questions that will come up in committee but, nevertheless, are good for people to reflect on at this point.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1393456">Mr. Speaker, some of the questions from the member opposite are far too technical for me to answer today. I simply do not have the answers, but I am more than happy to find out for him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393457">The biggest single advantage to this amendment is that it will now allow the RCMP and other police agencies to be on level playing fields to have lateral movement. In the organization I came from, people left to go to the RCMP and vice versa. There were always difficulties for those members in trying to match up the pension benefits because the legislation was not there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393458">This is an opportunity for that whole area to be strengthened and to provide clarity. From my perspective, and I think from the community's perspective, one of the bad things that happens is that good young men and women want to do a great job in policing and for whatever reason decide they would like to continue their careers perhaps in other communities and the options are not available. When people are members of a municipal force they are located in that community, so they frequently look to move or, as I said in my earlier comments, it may be that their family is moving.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393459">This will provide the opportunity to keep those good people within policing. It is what they have been trained for and what many of them have dedicated their lives to. It is a good opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393460">I would like to thank my friend across the aisle for thinking that I might want to continue my career in policing. I think it is in the past as opposed to in the future.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1393461">Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the parliamentary secretary for his remarks. I think he did a good job in encapsulating the importance of this bill to provide for mobility of transfer, mobility of pension credits, and also portability within the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393462">There are some technical aspects of this, and I do not want to burden the parliamentary secretary, but we have heard some concerns raised that senior RCMP officers did not get credit for the six month training period for which officers are now paid but were not years ago. There may be an anomaly with these individuals not getting credit for their training whereas someone transferring in from the OPP or somewhere else might.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393463">Is the minister prepared to say the government would look favourably upon perhaps some technical changes in committee that may be needed to reduce anomalies and to make sure that there truly is a level playing field? Can he comment on that?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393464">Our party is fully supporting this bill. It is unfortunate that previous legislation passed in 1999 was not really brought in with proper regulations and made workable. I want to commend the government on doing this now. We will be supporting it, but we would like to look at some of the possibilities that certain changes might need to be made. Would the parliamentary secretary be able to comment on that?</ParaText>

I am certain he will have those questions and by the time this gets to committee, we will have those answers for him.

              <ParaText id="1393467">Mr. Speaker, I would like ask my hon. colleague, a former RCMP officer, a simple question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393468"> Before Christmas the RCMP received a very nasty present. The government tore up its wage agreement, an agreement that would have simply given the RCMP wage parity with other police forces across this country. Right now we have a situation where we have a massive global deficit. RCMP officers are paid less than municipal and provincial police forces in Canada. They work extremely hard. They have the largest expanded coverage, not only within our country but they are deployed abroad under very dangerous circumstances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393469">I would like to ask my hon. colleague, as an RCMP officer, at his gut level, with his former brothers and sisters and comrades in the RCMP, does he not think it is an affront to every single RCMP officer in this country that his government tore that agreement up, and that it is in effect going to damage the ability of people to get into the RCMP and to retain the RCMP officers who do a remarkable job from coast to coast in our country and around the world? Will he commit to asking his government to change that deplorable decision and enable the RCMP officers to get the wage increase that they deserve?</ParaText>

If he had been here a few minutes earlier, he would have heard that I was not a member of the RCMP. In fact, I was a member of a municipal police force in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393471">This bill is about assisting RCMP officers, those who join in lateral entry or those who leave and take lateral entry to another force for whatever reason. If the hon. member was to make inquires and to listen to the committee, he would find that the RCMP have been able to recruit large numbers of new recruits. This government has begun the process that was ended by the former government in paying recruits while they are at depot, which is something brand new in these last few months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393472">I appreciate his comments, but I think that he is in the wrong venue, given the tenor of this bill.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1393473">Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary secretary raised some issues that are important, and that is the ability of police officers to go from one force to another for a myriad of reasons. They could be going from a smaller police force to a larger police force that affords them an opportunity to expand their horizons, whether it be training or some special investigative unit and so on. It also permits the transferability from larger police forces to smaller police forces to bring that kind of expertise. It could be from strictly a personal or family ability to follow one's wife or husband in another job. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393474">The parliamentary secretary might want to educate the last questioner on what occurred when a member of his party was the premier of Ontario. Not only did he not give police officers raises, he cut back on their salaries by what was referred to as “something days”.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1393478">Mr. Speaker, I had the benefit of reading this bill last night. I can assure hon. members that if there is any need for insomnia cures, this would be a recommended bill to read. As the hon. parliamentary secretary said, it is a very technical bill. It will be debated in committee and will be supported by our party. The previous questions had to do with fairly technical issues about transferability and calculation of the pensions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393479">It is an important bill and it one which rectifies a number of inequities in our treatment of this very important institution and the men and women who constitute the RCMP and their role and contribution to our society. It builds upon the work that was done in the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act in 2003, which modernized these pensions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393480">As I said, the Liberal Party will support the bill and it will be one that I hope receives a thorough review in the committee so these inequities can be addressed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393481">Pensions have been a subject of concern for Canadians for a while now. Going back to the previous government, the Chrétien and Martin years, pensions were addressed as an overall concept, particularly with respect to the Canada pension plan. Over much protest, particularly by the Conservative Party but by others as well, the Canada pension plan was made into a viable, fiscally sound pension plan. In fact, it is fiscally sound for 75 years, which is the last year I heard. Primarily it was done by the upping of contributions by way of payroll deductions, which was good. Now we are in a very serious economic situation and we can take some comfort in the fact that the Canada pension plan is a viable one and Canadians can rely on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393482">I am quite pleased the government has appointed the parliamentary secretary to review federally regulated pension plans. There certainly are some controversies around pension plans at this stage, particularly with respect to the ratios, the amounts of money that need to be set aside to fund the pension obligations. Those ratios are under strain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393483">One issue that will come up, particularly with respect to pension plans that will be unable to meet the criteria, is the issue of whether we would move the age of eligibility upward, which is a breach of good faith with those who have counted on 65 being the age of eligibility. That would have to be a question. I hope the parliamentary secretary and the government will address that. They will also have to address the huge meltdown in assets that has taken place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393484">Caisse de depot, for instance, has lost something in the order of 25% of its value over the last year, about $40 billion, some of it just by virtue of the market cycle, but some by virtue of very poor investments in asset-backed commercial paper. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393485">In this morning's news, the teachers' pension plan was reorganizing its portfolio away from direct investments in Canadian corporations and into less direct investments in a broader array of companies, particularly in derivative products. That is a decision, the consequences of which is the teachers' pension plan will have less influence in the boardrooms of the nation, which some might argue is not a good thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393486">The entire pension field is operating in a real state of flux as the economics and the viability of pension plans come under question. We have for instance, the GM Chrysler pension plans and all of us have significant pressure for this bailout. The irony is that Canadian taxpayers, 70% of whom do not have pensions, are being asked to “bail out” the pension plans of Chrysler workers, GM workers and possibly even Air Canada workers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1393499">Mr. Speaker, there is an element of trust beyond the normal employer-employee relationship when we are dealing with Canada's main police force and the government. It is a special relationship where the RCMP is cast into a whole variety of roles, many of which are almost morally ambiguous roles, and it finds itself on the front lines of some of the most difficult situations that can be imagined.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393500">I accept as truth the hon. member's assertion that the morale of the force is in some decline and that it is in a difficult situation.

              <ParaText id="1393503">When we are talking about morale, does the member not think that the hiring of over 1,600 additional police officers for the RCMP is good for morale? Would he not say that attracting members to the force and having their morale start in a positive way, and paying recruits who were not paid before for their six months at depot, is good for their morale? Would he not agree with me that expanding the training facilities at depot is good for the morale of the RCMP?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393504">If I were to tell the member that at committee, Deputy Commissioner Sweeney from the RCMP said that the recruitment process in the RCMP was meeting its goal, in other words, it was almost at the maximum ability of depot to train officers, would that not be good for morale?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393505">While the wage increase is not where it should be, does the member not agree that some Canadians are taking advantage of some of the improvements to employment insurance by taking part, with some employers, in work-shares, so employment insurance is assisting people to stay at work? People are accepting no wage increases. At General Motors, the employees are accepting a wage decrease in order to keep their jobs. Would he not say that a 1.5% increase in employment is good for morale?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393506">If morale were that bad, we would not see people wanting to become members of the RCMP. Again, I refer to the member for <Affiliation DbId="128246" Type="2">Toronto Centre</Affiliation>.

              <ParaText id="1393508">Mr. Speaker, I have never been a police officer but it seems to me that it is one of those jobs where people put their lives on the line each and every day. When they walk into an apartment building they have no idea what will happen or how it will come down. When they drive down the streets of Toronto, Vancouver or any other large city, they have no idea what will happen next. They, in effect, live life on the edge. We see way too many police officers either being injured or killed in the course of their line of duty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393509">It gets kind of elemental. It seems to me that if my employer is expecting me to put my life on the line each and every day, in each and every way, the least I could expect of my employer is to honour my wage agreements. That is as base and as elemental as it gets. Just simply honouring the collective agreement that they already entered into will do more for morale than pretty well everything that the hon. member mentioned previously.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1393512">Mr. Speaker, the Bloc Québécois is concerned about how members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police who have reached retirement age are treated. Many of them have had to make major sacrifices in the name of freedom and justice. Many of them have put their own lives and safety on the line. The Bloc is also aware that the RCMP is having some recruitment problems, and we believe that recognizing years of service with provincial or municipal police services could be part of the solution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393513">To ensure that all members of the RCMP receive just and fair treatment, the Bloc Québécois will support this bill at second reading so that it can go to committee.

Studying the bill in committee will give us a chance to call witnesses from various groups so that they can all have their say about Bill <Document DbId="3727297" Type="3">C-18</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393514">During this time of economic crisis, and given the fragile state of public finances, the Bloc Québécois is also concerned about sound management of public funds. That is why we are committed to a thorough examination of the viability of the RCMP pension fund and all possible financial repercussions of this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393515">On March 9, the <Affiliation DbId="128704" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> introduced Bill <Document DbId="3727297" Type="3">C-18</Document> at first reading. Bill C-18 amends the pension plan created under the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act. Principal changes to the act provide the necessary powers to broaden past service provisions and to implement pension transfer agreements. Past service means buying back years of service for entitlement to a full pension. Bill C-18 sets the cost of buying back service according to actuarial rules. According to information from the Library of Parliament, the member is responsible for the cost of buying back past years of service. Buy-back can be financed through the member's former pension plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393516">This bill contains a number of very technical provisions. I share the view that promoting lateral entries from one police force to another is a good thing. In general, I share the concerns of the members who have already spoken that people who have been in a job for a certain length of time and who are no longer happy do not perform at their best. When they stay in a job just because they want to keep their pension benefits, they do not perform at their best. If they are allowed to change jobs and transfer their pensions, they will start their new jobs with new enthusiasm, contribute fully and be much more effective. The various technical provisions will be studied in committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393517">The RCMP divisional representatives in Quebec have some concerns. For example, until a legislative change was made, the time spent in training by cadets, as recruits are known, was included in their pensionable service. According to the RCMP divisional representatives in Quebec, though, the definitions in Bill <Document DbId="3727297" Type="3">C-18</Document> still do not recognize the years RCMP cadets spent in training. According to the RCMP, this is an anomaly, because under Bill C-18, recruit training in provincial and municipal police forces would be recognized when officers join the RCMP, at least, for all the officers coming from police forces in Ontario and Manitoba.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393518">The Bloc Québécois will look at all of this in committee and will benefit from the testimony of the stakeholders. Many members of the RCMP will soon be receiving their pensions. The figure of 1,600 was mentioned. These police officers will have to be replaced. It is important that potential members continue to know that they are exposed to certain risks, but that those risks are offset by attractive salaries and pensions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1393520">Mr. Speaker, one of the challenges RCMP officers have across the country came as a consequence of the slaughter of RCMP officers a few years ago in the Prairies. RCMP officers must now travel by twos to calls that could be dangerous. This is more than understandable. The problem is the huge manpower deficit on the force.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393521">The Government of Canada has said that it has put in some monies, but I would suggest that has been quite late in coming because it promised to do this years ago, and the needs of the RCMP are actually much greater. Also the monies are not there to pay for the RCMP officers on the ground to do their work. The RCMP budget does not cover the hours required to do the coverage. For example, in Sooke there is only 70% of a full complement. That 70% has to work more than 100% of what is required. Therefore, the officers accrue overtime, which is normal, fair and due to them, but it destroys the budget of the RCMP and therefore, the coverage declines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393522">Does the member not think that the government should forthwith put forward the resources to provide the RCMP officers the operating budget they need to do their work while they have a significant deficit in manpower?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1393523">Mr. Speaker, I agree wholeheartedly with my hon. colleague about the RCMP not having adequate resources at this time. Not only does it lack resources, but it is constantly being given new duties. But that is not the issue here. I also completely agree with the previous speakers who denounced the way the RCMP was treated at the time of the last wage increase. RCMP members were told they would receive a certain wage increase, and that amount was later reduced. It seems to me that when a promise is made, it must be kept. True, in private companies, where some people were especially well paid, employees agreed to reductions, but again, those wage reductions were negotiated. We have not yet reached the point where wage reductions are necessary in the public service. When a promise is made, people have every right to expect that that promise will be kept. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393524">Now the RCMP faces other problems. In my opinion, some duties should be given to independent agencies. For instance, forensic laboratories come to mind. We would see increased credibility if those labs did not report to the police forces, given that they are called upon to testify in courts of law where they must appear completely independent and unbiased towards either the prosecution or defence. Furthermore, they have so many duties that turnaround times are getting longer and longer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393525">I learned this week that the RCMP's budget is being reduced this year. I had the figures yesterday—I do not remember the exact number—but it is several tens of thousands of dollars anyway. I do not understand such decisions. However, that is not the problem at issue in the bill before us. For this bill, we hope to reach a consensus to bring forward the necessary changes.</ParaText>

There is an officer whose name I have forgotten, but I remember the case well because I have read it several times and talked about it often. I could not find it in my computer's memory this morning, but it is there somewhere.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393531">In the past, the Bloc Québécois has introduced private members' bills to enable people to exercise their right to free association. The officer whose name I have forgotten lost his case, but he lost it on the grounds that the union would have been part of the general public service union. The Supreme Court's decision rested on the fact that if there is to be a police union, it must be separate from public service unions because its members may, in the course of their duties, find themselves in certain positions. However, the Supreme Court ruling did not say that they do not have the right to form a union.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393532">Therefore, I agree completely. It has occurred to me that, should I have the opportunity to introduce a bill, this subject would be my second choice, my first being the protection of journalistic sources. We will support a bill if it is well written and complies with the framework the Supreme Court has set out. Frankly, I think that your party is one of the reasons for this delay because this case was before the Supreme Court before 2006, even before 2004.

              <ParaText id="1393533">Mr. Speaker, one of the other challenges is that the RCMP and other police officers across the country are finding that organized crime gangs have the upper hand in many cases. Our legislation has not kept up with the advances in the technological abilities of those involved in organized crime. The real parasites in our society are profiteering off the status quo, driven primarily by drug money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393534">In British Columbia there have been over 40 shootings. There have been 19 deaths and 20 people have been injured. They are people who have been caught in the crossfire of drug battles, or people who have been part of the crime gang drug battles. Essentially, these battles are turf wars driven financially through drug money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393535">The government ought to be listening to the RCMP and other police forces in Quebec and across the rest of Canada. It should adopt the solutions the RCMP is asking for. The police should be able to share information, to extract information, to tap into the IT tools, such as BlackBerries, and use that information against those involved in organized crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393536">One of the most difficult challenges is to ensure that the speed with which the judicial process occurs will quicken. Right now the judicial process is too slow. It needs to be more efficient. We need to support initiatives to improve those areas within our judicial system.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1393537">Mr. Speaker, this is an extremely broad topic. Personally, I completely disagree with this government's policies and the way it deals with crime. This government knows only one solution for everything: tougher sentences, and they definitely do not work. The United States has proven this, since their crime rate is much higher than that of Canada. Their homicide rate is three and half times higher than Canada's, and five times higher than Quebec's, I might add. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393538">I would remind the hon. member that in the past, I introduced a new method for dealing with organized gangs, and that was the integrated teams. When I was the Quebec minister of public safety, together with the chiefs of the Montreal police and the Quebec provincial police, I founded the famous Carcajou squad, which finally managed to break the back of the Hells Angels. I never asked for tougher sentences. The crimes committed by these people were serious enough that the Criminal Code allowed for extremely tough sentences, which they were given.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393539">As for warrants to tap into devices other than telephones, it seems to me that we have already seen a bill on that. I am for it. I think we must find ways to tap into these new technologies. I could go on at length about this. The current government, with its tendency to follow the worst example of our neighbour to the south, is overlooking intelligent approaches that have been taken in other provinces. Once again, this demonstrates that we are indeed two very distinct nations. If we were one people— </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1393550">According to the AFEAS, lack of recognition for invisible work is one of the factors in the persistent inequalities between women and men. It is also a factor in the poverty of women who choose to take care of their children or their incapacitated, ill or disabled relatives. These mothers and caregivers continue to live in poverty when they retire.</ParaText>

That is why, this year, the AFEAS and other women's groups in Quebec and Canada are reiterating that it is important that Canada measure and take into account the unpaid work in every family, as it promised to do at the World Conference on Women, held in Beijing. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1393552">Mr. Speaker, a very important event has taken place within the Canadian electricity market this week. For the first time in history, Newfoundland and Labrador is selling power from the Churchill Falls hydro project directly into the United States, through Hydro-Québec transmission lines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393553">It is a small amount of power, reserved from the 1960s deal that saw virtually all Churchill Falls electricity go to Hydro-Québec, which eventually reaped enormous windfalls, getting the lion's share of profits to the consternation of Newfoundland and Labrador.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393554">But it is historic because it could be a first step and a building block for a Canadian power grid. It is based on a concept very much part of the American power grid, but new to Canada, called “wheeling rights”. The United States regulatory system requires participants in its electricity grid to allow others access to the grid through its facilities as a condition of participation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393555">Congratulations to Hydro-Québec and Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro and its parent, Nalcor, on this historic deal. We hope that this model can help show the way for the development of a true Canadian electricity grid, allowing cleaner, greener energy to be developed and marketed within Canada. We hope the federal government will step up to the plate and start playing a role in making this happen.</ParaText>

They have timely access to quality care, and even expanded coverage for drugs and long-term care, all at a lower cost.</ParaText>

With over 120,000 members, it is the largest young people's association in Quebec today. The federation was founded when the tuition freeze was lifted in 1989. As an advocate for the rights and interests of university students in Quebec, the organization is a major stakeholder in the field of education in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393598">One of its primary concerns is the fact that post-secondary education in Quebec is underfunded. Both the federation and the Bloc Québécois believe that the solution must involve returning federal transfers to their 1994 levels. It is time for this government to give Quebec the tools it needs to take charge of its jurisdiction over education.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393599">I would like to thank the Quebec federation of university students for its contribution to the quality and availability of university education in Quebec.

              <ParaText id="1393602">First is the danger of state-sanctioned incitement to genocide. Simply put, the genocide in Rwanda did not occur because of the machinery of death, but because of the state-sanctioned culture of hate.</ParaText>

The horror of the Rwandan genocide is not only that of the genocide, but that this genocide was preventable. Nobody can say that we did not know. We knew, but we did not act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393604">Third is the danger of a culture of impunity. Let there be no mistake about it: Impunity always means coming down on the side of the victimizer, never on the side of the victim.</ParaText>

          <ParaText id="1393822">The House resumed   consideration of the motion that Bill <Document DbId="3727297" Type="3">C-18, An Act to amend the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act, to validate certain calculations and to amend other Acts</Document>, be read the second time and referred to a committee.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="128291" Type="2">Mr. Jack Harris (St. John's East, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1393823">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity speak today at second reading of Bill <Document DbId="3727297" Type="3">C-18, An Act to amend the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act, to validate certain calculations and to amend other Acts</Document>, which is a long title.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393824">I will first tell the House what this bill is not about. It is not about the RCMP, in general, as an organization. I think as all Canadians know, and for the benefit of those watching, it is important to understand that this debate is not about the issues that our party and other Canadians have with some of the actions of the RCMP, in particular, RCMP management failing to take appropriate measures to protect Canadians in terms of the policies regarding tasers and the ongoing debate about that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393825">We are concerned of course about the failure to have policies that meet the test of Canadian values. We are very concerned about the failure of the government to provide proper civilian oversight of the RCMP, which was called for by Justice O'Connor and was implicit in Mr. Justice Iacobucci's recommendations. The Auditor General has pointed out some of the problems. We are also concerned about the government's failure to apologize for RCMP actions that contributed to the international torture of Canadians in Syria and Egypt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393826">Those are all things we have concerns about but this bill is not about those things. This bill is about the pay and benefits and the proper treatment of individuals who serve in our Royal Canadian Mounted Police. We have a great respect for the work they do in protecting our communities. They serve, as members know, in many provinces as the provincial police force. They do in British Columbia and in my own province of Newfoundland and Labrador, with the exception of St. John's, Cornerbrook and Labrador City which are under the jurisdiction of the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary. They are a very important part of rural Canada. They are the means of support for our communities, not only in terms of providing great policing and risking their lives in providing safety to our communities, but they also play an important role in community activities as volunteers, as leaders of sports activities, being role models for individuals and those who wish to serve their country. We do have a lot of respect for what the RCMP do in our communities across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393827">On the issue of pay and benefits, we are concerned that the government, after agreeing with the RCMP, through its special service representatives, on a pay increase that was to take effect this year, putting it in its manuals and in its HR provisions, unilaterally withdrew that and reduced the pay increase, effectively reducing their pay. We are very supportive of the RCMP members in their campaign to reverse that decision. We are not happy with some of the things that the government has done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393828">We do, however, support this legislation which is designed to provide a level playing field for Mounties when it comes to their pensions, particularly with respect to the portability of service. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393829">In the federal public service, there are 75 transfer agreements with other agencies to allow the transfer of pensionable service from one employment to another. It is true for members of this House and it is true for most public servants under the public service pensions benefits act. It is also true in other parts of the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393830">This legislation is long overdue. Legislation was passed in 1999 that was supposed to allow for portability of pensions. However, when the government finally, five or six years later, got around to drafting the regulations to make it possible, it was determined the legislation itself was inadequate to do what needed to be done. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393831">Therefore, here we are again, 10 years later, passing legislation to enable this to happen. I am certainly disappointed in that because I know the RCMP members have been looking for this kind of pension portability since the mid-1990s.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="15">(1215)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1393832">This is long overdue but we do need to study it. We support the principle of it because it is very important. Many individuals serving in municipal police forces across the country providing yeomen service to their communities may want to transfer into the RCMP and they should be able to take their pension service and pension credits with them. This bill would allow them to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393833">It is important that we have that kind of portability. It should be available to Canadians generally, but in this particular case we are dealing with employees of the Government of Canada through the RCMP and we want to assure people that we support these changes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393834">The other important part of this bill is that it would allow agreements to be made with other agencies to transfer those pension credits and the money that goes with them, because, frankly, every time there is pensionable service, there has to be an amount of money set aside. It is usually defined by actuaries as to how much money it would take to actually pay out the pension that one has earned and that money would be transferred in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393835">This bill would also give members of the RCMP the opportunity to buy back previous service. Even though eligible service may not have been pensionable in the other work, it would now be pensionable through this bill. There are provisions for the member who is paying the actuarial value of that, essentially buying into the service that is deemed to be pensionable service for the purpose of this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393836">This bill has significant monetary implications for individual members but it is designed to create a system that provides fairness to RCMP members, whether they are coming into the RCMP from another service or with other pensionable service, such as Canadian Forces service, military police service and other kinds of service that are deemed appropriate to be included in pensionable service for police officers, or whether they are going out of the RCMP for another opportunity in a different police service. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393837">We could have members of the RCMP who want to apply for jobs in other communities with another police service. This could be a significant advancement for that individual into a more senior position. We would not want them to be stuck in a job because of pension inflexibility when there are other opportunities for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393838">We support the bill in principle. We have been advised that a couple of questions have been asked by RCMP officers, some of whom are part of the official group called the staff relations representatives, an internal RCMP group elected by the members in various provinces and who are on the RCMP payroll. It is not a union, which is another issue on which we are unhappy with the government. The government has been fighting unionization in the courts, despite the fact that the Supreme Court of Canada has said that RCMP officers are entitled to the benefits of the freedom of association guaranteed to everyone in this country under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. However, they are still having to fight and another court case is going on now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393839">The RCMP staff relations representatives are pleased that this bill is coming forward after more than a dozen years of trying to get this forward. However, other organizations and associations are seeking unionization and they brought forth some concerns as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393840">As others have said, we do need to recognize that this is a very technical bill. Pensions are very technical and require actuarial considerations where costing is concerned. Any time a change is made, a cost is associated with it but the question is whether the cost will be borne by the individual who is getting the benefit or by the government for other policy reasons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393841">I will not be proposing changes here on the floor of this House at second reading. The bill will be referred to the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security where there will be opportunities to look at the kinds of changes that might need to be made. There may need to be some adjustments to fix anomalies.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1393842">One anomaly that has been suggested to me is the potential problem of discriminatory treatment between people who have perhaps had their training with another force. I do not know all of the facts but the suggestion is that the training component in other police forces, the work they do as recruits, as cadets, is paid for in pensionable service. I think the OPP was mentioned as an example. Someone transferring from the OPP into the RCMP pension fund will be able to take that pensionable service with them and get credit for it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393843">RCMP officers who are recruited today and go to their training as cadets, are now paid. The six months that they spend training, they are salaried employees and, presumably, covered by the pensionable service. However, existing RCMP officers who were trained years ago, whether it was 2 years ago, 10 years ago or 15 years ago, that period of training is not included in their pensionable service. That seems to me to be an anomaly and there may need to be some arrangements made to allow that to be pensionable service so there is a level playing field. Some provision may need to be made for either that to be placed in pensionable service or that the members may be able to buy back that service as part of their overall pension.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393844">Those are technical things about which we would look forward to hearing from the RCMP members themselves, whether retired or active, whether they are involved with a staff relations representative or whether they are involved with those organizations that are seeking unionization.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393845">Having said all that, I do want to say that we support the bill. It is an important advancement for the benefits of RCMP members. It is something we can support on a stand-alone basis while we criticize the government for its inaction on a lot of other points, whether they be the wage rates that were rolled back, the failure to support unionization or the failure on another level to make changes to the RCMP organization that we think are desirable.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1393846">Mr. Speaker, I was happy to hear that my friend from the NDP will be voting in favour of this legislation, subject, of course, to some of the issues that may come up in public safety committee, of which we are both members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393847">I listened intently to his preamble, which really had nothing to do with the bill, so I think it offers an opportunity for some questions that actually have to do with the bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393848">One of the issues he talked about and the reason NDP members are supporting the bill is that it is good for the RCMP. I am glad to hear they will be supporting the bill but, of course, the vote in the House will be the determining factor as to whether they do. We have been disappointed by some of those votes, which relate directly to support of the RCMP. I refer to budgetary items such as the hiring of 1,600 members of the RCMP. When we work really hard, we need extra bodies to help, and he and his party voted against that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393849">He and members of his party also voted against money to expand Depot so they could train those new officers. He also voted against some of the other measures we took that will greatly enhance the RCMP's ability to do their job. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393850">I wonder if he would like to comment on those additional things. Why did he vote against those measures?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1393851">Mr. Speaker, does the member really think Canadians are that stupid that they do not understand that nobody votes separately on a budget item in this House, such as whether we should increase the number of police officers? We support the increasing of support for the RCMP, and we have supported that publicly. We know it helps to make communities safer. We need to act to prevent crime, not just treat criminals with the kind of harsh measures that the government seems to have as the only solution. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393852">Members opposite do this every day. They think that Canadians are really stupid and they do not understand that when we vote for a budget, it is the entire budget, all the bad things. The budget, for example, contains the rollback of RCMP wages. All the negative things are also in the budget. A budget is a statement of confidence in the government and we do not have it, which is why we voted against the budget. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393853">It is not a question of voting against individual measures. Obviously there are many positive things in any budget. If what the member said were true, no budget would ever be defeated and no one would ever really bother to have budget votes. The government would just say that this is its budget and everyone will support it because otherwise they will be voting against something positive.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1393854">Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="128291" Type="2">St. John's East</Affiliation> for his fine speech and for his indication that the NDP will be supporting the bill at second reading. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393855">I want to ask him something specifically about the importance of this legislation. In the province of British Columbia and in Newfoundland as well RCMP officers in many of our communities are the only police force. In my riding of <Affiliation DbId="128650" Type="2">Nanaimo—Cowichan</Affiliation> the RCMP is the only police force there. I also understand that in many of our communities, and again this is the case in my community, we often have difficulty in filling the vacancies for RCMP officers. The bill currently before us may help in some of that recruitment and retention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393856">I wonder if the member could comment first of all on some of the challenges he sees with recruitment and retention of RCMP officers, but also how the implications in Bill <Document DbId="3636372" Type="3">C-10</Document>, which roll back that agreement, will contribute to some challenges for the RCMP in recruiting the members that many of our communities rely on. Rural and remote communities are often not the first community of choice. If we cannot make sure that RCMP officers are treated fairly with their wages and pensions, we are going to have increasing difficulties. I wonder if the member could comment on that.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1393857">Mr. Speaker, with regard to RCMP officers, first and foremost they are people with careers with families, who want to understand that they have financial security and that they are treated fairly. The bill is an aspect of that. They are going to have more security in their jobs and are more likely to stay in those jobs, and undertake the responsibilities of working in small communities, doing their duty in places where others may not wish to go because they will know they are being treated well by their pension system. That is an enhancement of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393858">The taking away of pay increases is a bit of a breach of faith and does go the other way and increases the insecurity that RCMP members feel. We are very disappointed with that and why we strongly opposed it. It does affect recruitment and also affects perhaps even more retention, the people who might want to stay for an extra two years knowing they are going to get an increase, and that their pension will be increased and their security after work is going to be increased. They might say, “I might as well get out now because I am not being treated fairly while I am in”, so that is important as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393859">First and foremost they are workers, they have families and careers, and they deserve fairness.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1393860">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="3727297" Type="3">C-18</Document> which is an act to amend the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act, to validate certain calculations and to amend other acts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393861">From some briefings that were provided in terms of the content of the bill, I want to highlight a couple of the aspects of the bill. I also want to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="128291" Type="2">St. John's East</Affiliation> for highlighting some of the challenges that will be brought forward in committee. The NDP is firmly in support of the bill and the member for St. John's East has identified a few problems that could be resolved at committee, and hopefully the government and other members of the House will take a look at some of the shortfalls in the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393862">The bill aims to make RCMP pensions more portable by allowing for the expansion of existing election for prior service provisions and permitting the introduction of pension transfer agreements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393863">The pension portability schemes are generally enacted to improve recruitment options especially for lateral applicants. Without pension portability provisions, such as those allowed by Bill <Document DbId="3727297" Type="3">C-18</Document>, pension credits with former employers, for example, with a municipal police force, would not be transferrable to the RCMP pension plan, making a lateral transfer to the RCMP less attractive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393864">The introduction of pension transfer arrangements will allow the RCMP to enter into formal arrangements with other Canadian pension plans to permit the transfer of pension credits into and out of the RCMP pension plan. Once implemented the pension transfer agreement sections will bring the RCMP pension plan into line with the federal public service pension plan which has approximately 770 pension transfer agreements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393865">We can see from that very brief outline that this is a very technical bill, but we can see that these kinds of pension agreements are already in place within the public service. It seems reasonable that the RCMP, who play such a critical role in many of our communities, should be able to have access to the same kinds of arrangements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393866">The member for <Affiliation DbId="128291" Type="2">St. John's East</Affiliation> touched upon this, but I want to remind the House that these proposed changes have actually been in the works since 1995. Once again, what we have is long delays in dealing with some legislative amendments that could have been dealt with more than 10 to 15 years ago. It happened in 1995, in 1999, and it happened again in 2005.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393867">Both the Conservatives and the Liberals simply could not get their act together in terms of addressing this anomaly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393868">I am pleased that it has now come before the House, but I want to touch on a couple of other points that I know the member for <Affiliation DbId="128291" Type="2">St. John's East</Affiliation> raised. I want to touch on them just so that people understand that the bill is still not perfect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393869">There have been some questions raised about the anomalies in the fact that although current recruits are being paid during training, previous recruits were not being paid. There are some concerns that they will not get the pension credit for that six months of unpaid training. That has changed, but there are current RCMP officers who are serving, who do not have that pension credit or the possibility of that pension credit. Therefore, I am sure that will be raised in committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393870">There are other concerns that have been raised around the fact that civilian employees for the RCMP are treated differently. Again, I am sure that will be raised in committee with an opportunity for potential amendments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393871">I just want to talk about the importance of this for a moment. In the briefing that was provided it talked about recruitment and retention. In my community of <Affiliation DbId="128650" Type="2">Nanaimo—Cowichan</Affiliation>, the RCMP are a vital part of the community. The RCMP is our police force. In the province of British Columbia, many of our communities are in that position. I know in Newfoundland that is also the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393872">Therefore, this bill is an important one in terms of both recruitment of officers and ongoing retention. I know that in my own community of North Cowichan, as a previous municipal councillor I was part of the protective services committee. One of our roles was examining the agreement that we had between the RCMP, the province and then of course the municipalities. We were consistently short of officers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393873">I live in a very beautiful part of the country. It was not an issue around RCMP officers wanting to work in my community. It was the fact that recruitment was often an issue. Retention was an issue. There were some challenges with leave provisions. For example, when an officer went on maternity leave at that time, there were no provisions to replace that officer.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1393874">Bill <Document DbId="3727297" Type="3">C-18</Document> is a very important factor when we talk about recruitment and retention. In many remote communities, it is very difficult to find officers to serve there. We need to make sure we are providing a compensation package, which includes pensions, that is very attractive so that we can recruit and retain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393875">There is another issue that has come up and has been mentioned a number of times in the House. When Bill <Document DbId="3636372" Type="3">C-10</Document>, the budget implementation bill, was put forward, it negated the agreement that had been put in place with RCMP officers around wage improvements. I know members throughout the House have been receiving letters, phone calls and emails about the unfairness of this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393876">I have an email from an officer who wanted to make sure that members understood the potential impact of the negating of that agreement in Bill <Document DbId="3636372" Type="3">C-10</Document>. The email states:</ParaText>

They often sit on committees contributing in a very positive way to the overall health and well-being of our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393886">I would argue that we should ensure once again to not only look at pension changes that will significantly contribute to recruitment and retention but that we also look at negotiated signed agreements. I know the member for <Affiliation DbId="128291" Type="2">St. John's East</Affiliation> raised the fact that the Supreme Court has upheld the ability of the RCMP to form a union and the current government continues to fight that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1393888">One of the reasons that this discussion around pensions is so critical is because in today's current economic climate there are some serious challenges with pensions.

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The laws concerning bankruptcy protection and pension insurance are closely related to the rules governing pension funding. If pensions are fully funded when employers enter bankruptcy protection, then bankruptcy laws do not matter much to the fate of the pension plan. On the other hand, if pension plans are underfunded when the employer becomes bankrupt, then the question of the nature of the claim that the pension fund has on the bankrupt company is critical, as is the question of whether the pension deficiency is insured.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="1393891">This is just one aspect of some very serious problems going on with pensions right now. The member from Hamilton will be going out to the public to talk about the kinds of reforms that are needed to pension plans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393892"> Bill <Document DbId="3727297" Type="3">C-18</Document> talks about portability. Many members will be surprised that I am quoting from a C.D. Howe Institute commentary on pensions, but the portability of pensions is an absolutely critical aspect. Again, for RCMP officers we are recognize that portability of their pensions is extremely important. Members of municipal police forces should have the ability to move from the municipal police force to the RCMP and not lose their pension credits. It is a very important aspect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393893">The C.D. Howe Institute is talking about pension portability from job to job across Canada. It is not talking specifically about RCMP officers; it is talking about all Canadians. I would argue that as we set the standard for RCMP officers to have that portability, we should make sure that other Canadians have that pension portability as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393894">In this particular case, the C.D. Howe Institute makes another recommendation. To put it into context, it says, “Canadians must understand that they all do not need to become experts in life-cycle finance and investments to achieve this goal”. It is talking about maintaining standards of living in retirement. The member for <Affiliation DbId="128382" Type="2">Sault Ste. Marie</Affiliation> has been a tireless advocate on poverty generally but certainly on poverty as it relates to seniors. One of the aspects that significantly impacts on seniors is changes that were made to the Canada pension plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393895">In the context of the Canada pension plan, I am getting a number of emails from people who are concerned about what is happening with the investments in the Canada pension plan. People want us to raise that here in the House. They are concerned about how the Canada pension plan is currently managed. However, that is outside the scope of Bill <Document DbId="3727297" Type="3">C-18</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393896">The C.D.

              <ParaText id="1393897">Part of the issue is that, first of all, many Canadians simply do not have a pension plan. We are talking about portability in the context of Bill <Document DbId="3727297" Type="3">C-18</Document>, that pension plans in Canada largely are not portable and we cannot take them from job to job, and because we are talking about this with Bill <Document DbId="3727297" Type="3">C-18</Document>, I would argue that at some point we need to introduce legislation that talks about portability across this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393898">I touched on the bankruptcy provisions. Many pension plans in this country are underfunded. If a company goes into bankruptcy protection, workers are at risk. In my riding we see forestry company after forestry company laying off people. There are some concerns as these companies go into bankruptcy protection with their underfunded pensions that workers who have worked 30 and 40 years, rather than going into retirement, have to go back to work. It is critical that we, as a House, perhaps using Bill <Document DbId="3727297" Type="3">C-18</Document> as a kickoff point, look at conducting a broader pension review. I know the government has been talking about examining what is happening with pensions, but we need to move on this very quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393899"> Women have been very concerned about what is happening with pensions because many women do not have either a private or a public pension. We are very concerned that we will see an increase in seniors living in poverty.</ParaText>

I would encourage the House to use Bill <Document DbId="3727297" Type="3">C-18</Document> as a catalyst to move quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393902">Again with Bill <Document DbId="3727297" Type="3">C-18</Document>, we have seen a bill that was looking at amendments back in 1995. We simply cannot wait that long for the kind of pension reform that is necessary. There is a wave of baby boomers, the first edge of which is turning 65 as we speak, that is going to change the face of retirement in this country. All too often we ear very sad stories about people who, after working for over 40 years, come up to retirement and find that they have to work at a McJob to survive in retirement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393903">There are a whole number of other issues that are facing seniors as they retire, such as the lack of availability of long-term care, home care support, access to prescription drugs, access to hospitals, and access to all kinds of other support programs for seniors. That is outside the scope of Bill <Document DbId="3727297" Type="3">C-18</Document>, but I would hope that we would put together a proactive package that looks at that whole range of issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393904">We often hear in this House of the social determinants of health. I would argue that we also need to look at the social determinants of aging, and at such things as housing and income security. Because there is this wave of baby boomers coming up to retirement, this would be an opportunity for us to be proactive and we could put together a package that would have some meaningful impact on people as they retire.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393905">In conclusion, Bill <Document DbId="3727297" Type="3">C-18</Document> is a very important move toward protecting our ability to make sure that our communities are kept safe. It is important that we put together a package that will encourage young men and women to see the RCMP as a viable career opportunity, and make sure that the pensions help in our ability to retain police officers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393906">I am very pleased to say that New Democrats will be supporting this bill. I look forward to hearing from the member for <Affiliation DbId="128291" Type="2">St. John's East</Affiliation> about testimony that will come forward at committee. Perhaps some amendments will be made to deal with some of the deficiencies that are currently in the bill before the House.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1393910">Mr. Speaker, the member is absolutely correct. Anybody who has ever worked in human resources management knows that an essential part of recruiting people to a particular career or profession is to ensure that attractive packages are in place. One of the aspects of Bill <Document DbId="3727297" Type="3">C-18</Document> is the portability of pensions when officers have served with other police forces. In many parts of this country there are tripartite agreements in place where the police force is band operated. I would hope the bill would include that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393911">Tripartite agreements are a whole separate issue. In many communities, we have had a great deal of difficulty because either the provincial government or the federal government is dragging its feet when it comes to signing those tripartite agreements so that first nations officers serve their own communities. However, that is another issue. The portability of pensions is extremely important around an attractive incentive program to recruit and retain officers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393912">Rural officers are the other aspect of this. Many of this country's communities are either fly-in communities or they are not easily accessible by rail or road. It is absolutely essential to recruit rural officers who have a good understanding of what it is like to live in a rural community. Again, the portability of pensions is an important aspect. Officers from large urban centres may want to go to remote and rural communities. However, they will not be able to transfer their pensions from a municipal police force to the RCMP force if we do not pass this bill.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1393914">Last month in my riding, I had the opportunity to attend the Tri-Force Regimental Charity Ball. It is an event that is put on by our local police forces: the RCMP, the OPP and the greater Sudbury regional police. This is just another example of the great work done by our law enforcement officers across our great land. They raise money for local charities. Specifically, this one was for Crime Stoppers. It was during that event that several RCMP officers approached me to talk about a few things that were happening here on the Hill. They talked about their concern for the rollback of their wages. Another discussion was about the portability of their pensions. Many of the officers approaching retirement age want to ensure that they have a secure retirement that they can enjoy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393915">It is important for us as parliamentarians to outline what we think are the important pieces of this bill that will benefit RCMP officers. I would like the hon. member to do that for us.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1393916">Mr. Speaker, as the member was speaking, I was reminded that about a month ago there was an RCMP appreciation night in the city of Nanaimo. The funds raised went toward supporting the local mid-island crisis and relief centres. Thousands of dollars were raised that night. It was a way of honouring the RCMP officers, but it was also a way of working with the RCMP to raise funds for a very important initiative. The RCMP officers generously gave of their time to attend that event and support the crisis centres. They also work very closely with the crisis centres. We know that those crisis centres have saved lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393917">As members have pointed out, this is a very technical bill, but the portability of pensions is absolutely critical. We have been talking about the fact that the non-portability has been a barrier. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393918">Also, RCMP officers have not been paid as well as other police officers in this country. That is the sad part of Bill <Document DbId="3636372" Type="3">C-10</Document>, the budget implementation act. It rolls back a negotiated wage increase that would have made some steps toward the RCMP being paid the same rate as other police forces. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393919">Right now, the non-portability of pensions is a deterrent to attracting officers. If officers want to move from a municipal force to the RCMP, it is a deterrent for them to do it because they will not get credit for their time served with the other police forces. This bill will remedy that. That is an important step toward recruitment and retention. Again, I believe that all members in the House will be supporting the bill. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1393923">The RCMP has extensive experience in rural and remote communities throughout the country. In many parts of the country the RCMP is the only police force.

In the rural and remote communities the officers are on the streets every day. They are very visible and the community is small enough so everybody recognizes them.

              <ParaText id="1393927">If members have read the briefing notes that were prepared for the legislation, they will know we are cleaning up work that should have been done more effectively and properly under the Liberals back in the 1990s, when they passed an act on pensions for RCMP officers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393928">Over the last few years we have changed the rules for doing business in the interest of expediting the will of the governing party to the detriment of a good political process of oversight, which includes getting it right the first time, dotting all the <I>i</I>s and crossing all the <I>t</I>s. Instead of doing that, we are back here today cleaning up work that should have been done right the first time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393929">In the few minutes I have, I want to talk about that because it is important. The bill, as presented, is a bit of a no brainer in terms of people supporting it. We thank the government for bringing it forward and we all need to get behind it. However, we need to ensure we do the right thing, which is to committee. Then we can invite all those who will be affected by it, or who may want to speak to it because of other concerns, or may want to bring other ideas to the table before the committee. We want to ensure they get a chance to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393930">Because of the way the House has been operating, particularly surprisingly under a minority government, legislation gets pushed through rather rapidly. Many people are concerned that we do not understand the full and complete impact of legislation on the lives of those who are directly affected by it and those who may be indirectly affected by it at the end of the day. Therefore, we need to look at that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393931">The other thing I want to speak about for a few minutes is something close to my heart. As I have done my work on trying to eradicate poverty in our country, I have been looking at this for quite some time. I have been at it now for almost 18 and a half years, both at the provincial legislature in Toronto and the federal level.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393932"> This comes from my work in the community where I ran a soup kitchen and worked with families that were under stress, trying to ensure their children would get a good start in life. They wanted to ensure they were supported and were aware of and knowledgeable about the services provided by governments and other organizations so they could live in dignity, as children, as families and as seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393933">It is important for all us to consider what we do for those who are perhaps in more privileged positions, and say that with some caution. They might not always be as privileged as some might think. However, for those who have pension plans, we need to ensure we make it as fulsome, supportive and as lucrative as possible for them. They have worked and have paid into it and they deserve it because of that effort.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393934">The great majority of Canadians do not have pensions, never mind the portability of pensions. The government needs to think about that as well, as we move the bill through the House. A lot of seniors across the country are struggling to make ends meet. Even on the very good program under Canada pension, because of inflation, the cost of living and other factors, seniors are struggling to pay their bills, their rent, their mortgages and their ever-increasing fuel costs. They have worked hard to build our country. They have participated in the industry of our country. Now they are in their twilight years and they find themselves struggling.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1393935">We are talking about enhancing pensions for a particular group in our society, which is the right thing to do, to ensure those pensions are portable. What they have earned by way of pension in other sectors, they get to take it with them to new sectors. It is important that we consider others who would love to be in a position of having a pension, other than Canada pension, to live on in their future years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393936">I want to talk a bit about that. We are living in difficult economic times. Many people struggled and pinched pennies to put away a little something above and beyond the Canada pension so they would have something to allow them to stay in their homes, or to look after family members, or to educate their kids or for their grandchildren who end up at their doors, who they have to look after. This bit of extra money set aside in their working years has now almost completely disappeared. We did not put in place those rules and regulations, which we now say we should look at for the RCMP, to protect and guaranteed that their money would be there for them when they retired.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393937">I would like to go back to the whole issue of the process and why we are here today. It is 10 years after the Liberal government of the day passed a bill that affected the pensions of RCMP. The Liberal government did not finish job. Somehow things fell off the table or were pushed under the carpet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393938">We do not pay enough attention to the importance of the processes that we put in place. Earlier in our history people may perhaps say we were not as sophisticated or connected communication-wise to ensure what we did was here the right thing. We need to ensure that when we do something, we do it completely and we understand the full ramifications of how it affects people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393939">Having served in the provincial legislature, as the member knows only too well because he worked there, the rules of that place were changed three times under three different political parties. The first time was when the provincial Liberals became the majority government in the late 1980s and they tried to rush their agenda through the legislature, without due process or considering the input of so many who had something to say or had some concerns about some of the legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393940">I remember some of the Liberal members were totally opposed and angry about what was going on. They explained what the impact would be, but nobody would listen because the government of the day was in a big hurry. It wanted to make changes and put in place the things it thought were in the best interests of the broader public, which at the end of the day sometimes turned out not to be. With the new rule changes, members were not given the chance to consider what could have been done to make it better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393941">I remember my party, when it became government in 1990, did the same thing. We were not sure we would be there very long, and that turned out to be the case. We wanted to get stuff done. We had pent up expectations when we finally came to power in 1990. We did not want these old-fashioned, long-term, difficult processes or hurdles, such as going to committee, going out on the road, listening to people, listening to more people and considering their input. We were in a hurry. We wanted to get it done.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1393942">To be frank and honest, we did some things as government, at that time, that had we thought longer about, had we opened up to more public input, listened to more people and been more considerate about, we might not have done. It might not have been so damaging to us politically at the end of the day. We got thumped big time in 1995 because of some of the things we did, not all of the things. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393943">We did some pretty good things, I have to say, between 1990 and 1995, some of them in the area of social policy where we changed rules and regulations in the workplace, for example, and we tried to improve the lot of seniors and our first nations in the jurisdiction of Ontario. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393944">However, we did some things that we might have thought longer about, that we might have been more willing to expose to the processes of the legislature at that particular point in time, which would have been helpful to us and ultimately to the broader public of Ontario. We did not do so and we paid a political price later. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393945">I say that to the government members in this place at this time, and I say it to the Liberals because they are propping up the government in its rush, in its haste to move forward on some things. I believe we would all be better served if we took a little bit longer and if we were more open to constructive criticism from others, not only inside the House but others out there who may want to speak to the issues, who have more to offer, who may have more understanding or may have studied or researched longer some of the things we address here as, for the most part, generalists. We need to respect the role of committees. We need to allow committees to do the work that committees are thought able to do, or at one time in our history, did, when they travelled across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393946">As a matter of fact, I speak to people who served in both the House of Commons and legislatures across this country in days gone by, who would not only travel across Canada to hear from people on things like the piece of legislation before us today and other very important public policy matters, but would travel across the world to get input, to see what other people were doing, to hear from other people as to whether what they tried worked, how it is working now, how long they had been at it, and what else should be considered as we look at the same challenge that perhaps they have dealt with, maybe in a different way. Perhaps we could add to it and we would contribute our intelligence to that discussion as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393947">We seem to be, in this place these days, in one heck of a hurry to get through things, to get stuff out the door and to change the way we interact with each other, do public business and put in place public policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393948">I believe, in the end, that will not only hurt the government party that is in power, as it bears the responsibility and the brunt of mistakes that often get made in that kind of environment, but it affects all of us who have been sent here to give leadership, to be responsible, to take responsibility and to act on behalf of our constituents, those communities that are so fragile, particularly in the difficult economy that we face right now. It is important that we do the right thing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393949">We are inviting other members of the House of Commons to get up and speak to the bill and so many other pieces of legislation that work their way through the House these days, on which we seem to be the only ones speaking. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393950">Every now and again we hear from a member of the Bloc Québécois, who are certainly engaged in an interesting and important way in the development of social policy, in my experience, for Quebec and for this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393951">However, mostly in this place these days, every afternoon, day after day, it is New Democrats standing up, raising issues, putting on the table concerns we have, introducing the research we have done on behalf of a certain piece of public policy or an approach that the government wants to take, challenging it and pointing out the deficiencies, suggesting changes that would make it better, suggesting that the work we do here that is so important find its way to committees so that we can bring in other people and have their input. Then we can listen to them, and at the end of the day, once we have heard from those people, we can actually make amendments to the bill that would reflect the fact that we heard and listened. We do not think we have all the answers. Somebody else might bring something else to the table. So we need to do that.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1393952">We are saying it again in this instance, as we have week after week, month after month, over the last four and a half years that I have been here, as subsequent governments, first Liberal then Conservative, have tried to ram stuff through in a hurry, in a way that presents opportunity for mistakes to be made. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393953">Back in the late 1990s when there was a bill presented to the House to be helpful to RCMP officers and their recruitment, in giving them the comfort they need to go out there and do their job well because they know they are going to be looked after in their retirement years, we dropped the ball. We made a mistake. This place made a mistake. Somehow this fell through the cracks. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393954">I would hope and expect that it did get before committee, although there is even the odd time in this place when a piece of work that is going to affect so many finds it way through first, second and third reading without even getting to committee. We need to think long and hard about that. Often that kind of haste is a mistake, and if that is what has happened in this instance with this bill, here we are now, trying to correct it, and hopefully we will correct it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393955">Hopefully we will deal with the bill in a way that will reflect the spirit of the bill, what is intended, and that it will be sent to committee and we will invite witnesses, and if need be, we will travel a bit to hear from people who perhaps cannot come and speak to us about what impact they think this will have, so that we can do the very best for our very important officers of the law, the RCMP. They have been given the back of the hand, frankly, by the government through what it has done with the budget that we just rushed through this place in a matter of a couple of weeks, only a short time ago, to reduce a commitment that was made through proper labour negotiations with the RCMP, for them to now find that in fact that is not going to be honoured.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393956">Here we are again, speaking to our RCMP officers through the work we do here, saying to them by way of getting the bill through the House and dealt with properly that we appreciate and understand the difficulty of their work, the fact that so many of their colleagues in the last few years have been killed on the job, have given the ultimate sacrifice in the protection of the public and our communities. We apologize for that action that has reduced their income as they go out and do that work, and for the message that sends in terms of confidence, and we will do the right thing by them in this instance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393957">We will get the bill to committee where we can fix any holes that might be in it, bring forward some amendments perhaps and hear from some people as to what else we should do. In doing that, we would consider the need to make sure that all Canadians, no matter what job they are doing and no matter how they are contributing to the overall good of our communities and our country, would also have a pension. They would not only have the Canada pension, which is a vehicle that is very important in this country, but they would also have access to those other small pots of pension money that become so important at the end of the day for so many of the things that we all want to contribute to in our community, to our families and in looking after ourselves.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1393962">Absolutely, the contribution that the members of the RCMP make in so many unique ways because of the areas they work in, the areas they specialize in, makes a big difference in our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393963">In my own community we have a detachment that, because of the proximity of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, to Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, plays a lot of different roles in terms of the traffic that goes back and forth between our two countries and the unlawful activity that might take place. That in fact is dangerous work, because one does not know who is coming across the border, what they are bringing with them and how they might be armed, in order to protect oneself in doing that work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393964">Therefore, absolutely we need to be doing everything we can in this House, given the very dismal track record of the government, particularly recently in taking away that increase in pay they were expecting to get, to at least protect their pensions and make it possible for those who moved to the RCMP from other policing jurisdictions to actually bring their pensions with them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1393974">Mr. Speaker, the Bloc Québécois supports the principle of Bill <Document DbId="3640419" Type="4">C-300, An Act respecting Corporate Accountability for the Activities of Mining, Oil or Gas in Developing Countries</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393975">The issue of social and environmental responsibility for Canadian companies abroad, particularly Canadian mining companies, has long been a concern for the Bloc Québécois.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393976">Canada is a world leader in the mining industry. It has a huge presence in Africa, where most companies are Canadian or American and are incorporated or listed in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393977">For some years now, a number of Canadian mining companies have been directly or indirectly associated with forced population displacements, significant environmental damage, support to repressive regimes, serious human rights violations and sometimes even assassinations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393978">That is why the Bloc Québécois has always defended the need to impose standards of social responsibility on companies when operating abroad. But the federal government has always defended the principle of laissez-faire, preferring a voluntary approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393979">Also, we have always defended the recommendations in the advisory group report entitled “National Roundtables on Corporate Social Responsibility and the Canadian Extractive Industry in Developing Countries”, whose recommendations were unanimously supported by civil society and the extractive industry. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393980">While Bill <Document DbId="3640419" Type="4">C-300</Document> is a step in the right direction, we believe it has flaws in terms of what the national roundtables advisory group recommended. For example, Bill <Document DbId="3640419" Type="4">C-300</Document> does not provide any clear, independent and transparent process to ensure accountability or to monitor Canadian companies' compliance with accountability standards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393981">Here is a review of Bill <Document DbId="3640419" Type="4">C-300</Document> by Delphine Abadie, Alain Deneault and William Sacher, the authors of <I>Noir Canada: Pillage, corruption et criminalité en Afrique</I>, published by Écosociété in 2008.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393982">First, the bill does not take the Canadian International Development Agency's policies and activities into account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393983">Second, it does not take Export Development Canada's lack of transparency into account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393984">Third, it does not take into account instances of political interference attributed, in some cases, to Canadian diplomacy in southern countries on behalf of Canadian mining interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393985">Fourth, it does not take into account the harmful role of the Toronto Stock Exchange in the appreciation of mining claims often obtained suspiciously in southern countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393986">Fifth, it does not say whether and under what terms, Canadian companies can or could be prosecuted civilly or criminally in Canada for injurious actions attributed to them abroad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393987">Sixth, it does not provide for an independent body to receive complaints from foreign nationals, leaving it rather to the minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393988">Seventh, it does not provide a process to evaluate the damages to populations outside Canada and consider implementing redress programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393989">Eighth, it totally ignores the numerous cases of abuse by Canadian companies already recorded in many credible documents. I am thinking of expert reports from the United Nations, parliamentary reports, conferences held in parliamentary precincts, reports from independent organizations like Amnesty International and Global Witness, comprehensive investigative reporting, compelling documentaries, assessments by recognized experts, and so.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1393990">Here are some representative cases cited in <I>Noir Canada</I> with respect to Canadian mining companies' detrimental activities in Africa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393991">The first example is from Bulyanhulu, Tanzania. In the summer of 1996, bulldozers and the national police force were used to expropriate several hundred small-scale miners and clear the way for Canada's Sutton Mining to exploit the area. Fifty-two people were buried alive in that operation. Sutton Mining was then bought by another Canadian company, Barrick Gold. Canada's diplomatic service was actively involved in the affair; allegations of interference are well founded. The Government of Norway, the Lawyer's Environmental Action Team, Friends of the Earth, Rights &amp; Democracy—an organization founded by the federal government itself—Mining Watch and master's student Dennis Tessier have all stated publicly that these allegations are credible and alarming. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393992">The second example is Banro, a company that helped kindle the bloody conflict in the African Great Lakes region in eastern Congo between 1997 and 2002. Millions died in that conflict, and untold distress was inflicted on the people in the form of rape, recruitment of child soldiers and destruction of villages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393993">The third example has to do with Diama-Manantali and Sadiola. The Canadian International Development Agency steadfastly supported dam construction projects that profited Canadian engineering firms. These dams, which have a catastrophic impact on the people—think of floods, loss of arable land, ecosystem destruction, disease, social tension and so on—allowed IamGold to turn a 38% profit on operating an open pit mine in Sadiola, another project with a disastrous impact on the people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393994">The fourth example is the Talisman corporation, which had to leave Sudan after, according to several sources, it apparently ordered the Sudanese army to violently remove any civilian presence in the vicinity of its development site. This passage from <I>Noir Canada</I> shows that Talisman was pressured to leave Sudan because it was registered on the New York stock exchange, not just the Toronto exchange.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1393995">Another book that has been written on this topic is <I>Not on Our Watch: The Mission to End Genocide in Darfur and Beyond</I>, by Don Cheadle and John Prendergast, published by Hyperion in 2007. On page 62 is a paragraph that reads:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1394001">I do not have to tell members that this is important work that we have done here, and we continue to do that kind of work, protecting the environment and protecting human rights and labour rights here in Canada, but it is absolutely critical that we establish standards that are consistent when our companies are doing operations abroad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394002">I want to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="128204" Type="2">Scarborough—Guildwood</Affiliation> for his initiative. I also have to reference a couple of my colleagues who brought this issue to the House. The member of Parliament for Ottawa Centre prior to me was Ed Broadbent. He worked tirelessly on this file, on democratic reform, and he pushed to have the round table report written.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394003">Members will know that the round table report was a good way of getting to the issue by bringing people from both civil society, including some of the groups that were mentioned by my friend from the Bloc, as well as from business. Mr. Broadbent, during his entire career in terms of academia and public service, as a member of this House and as leader of our party, always wanted to see the model that has worked so well in other mature democracies, where we bring together all of the disparate groups of business, labour and civil society, to forge good policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394004">I must give credit. That was done. We had the report. It was tabled and the government was asked for a response over two years ago. It was not until just last week that we received a response from the government. I am actually very upset, disappointed and surprised that the government did not take the advice given to it from business and civil society to do the right thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394005">Instead of bringing in standards, along the lines of what I just laid out, on human rights, labour rights and environmental rights that should apply to Canadian companies doing business abroad, and bringing in an enforcement and monitoring mechanism with an ombudsperson, what did the government do? It brought in voluntary guidelines. Just put those two words together and I will leave it to members if they think that is sufficient. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394006">Instead of an ombudsperson, it brought in a counsellor. Counsellors have a role. We go to them for advice sometimes, but they have no business in this file. What the government did was play around with nomenclature. It said that instead of an ombudsperson there will be a counsellor. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394007">What the government did was an insult, to be blunt. After years of waiting for a response from government on this important file, it gave back thin gruel. It might as well have not responded at all because the consensus report by business and civil society was very clear as to the road forward. All it had to do was adopt the recommendations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394008">I remember well at committee, having a motion put forward at the foreign affairs committee asking for a response from the government. It said, “It's okay. We're working on it”. Two years later and this is what we get.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394009">This is an important initiative. We have to forge ahead. We cannot let this ball be dropped. We cannot let it be watered down. We cannot let the government's response be seen as a responsible response to all those people who worked so hard on this file.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1394010">What is this about? I want to talk a bit about the extractive industries abroad. I worked for half a year in Latin America in countries like Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala, I saw directly what happens to everyday people when a company comes in, obtains rights to drill or mine and moves people who have been there forever off of their land because they are allowed to do whatever they want. They pull the resources out of the land, make a profit and leave town. They often leave behind tailings, a devastated environment, people who received meagre wages and an economy that is not better but worse. As they leave the country, they bring with them a handsome profit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394011">I know that most people who invest want to ensure their investments are ethical. Most people believe they are. I do not know anyone in my neighbourhood or constituency who would sleep well if they knew that the profits they were making off their investments were made at the expense of human suffering or environmental degradation. Sadly, most of the time they have no idea what is going on. This bill and the idea of corporate responsibility would shine a light on what is going on abroad and ensure we have standards and oversight in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394012"> I know many members of the Conservative caucus believe strongly in human right and in ethical investment. Many are members of faith communities and the old adage that one should not make a profit off the back of their brother is consistent with their faith. It is something that is understood and internalized by them. I am not sure that they know this as members of the Conservative caucus but they have not taken this opportunity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394013">Many faith groups have gotten behind this initiative, as well as civil society groups that believe strongly in the representation of workers and indigenous peoples in third world countries. Since I pushed my private member's bill initiatives at committee, the number of petitions from faith groups of all faiths that I have received in support of the bill has been tremendous. They have been very determined to see that what we do abroad is something that is consistent with our values. For them, it is consistent with their faith. For them, there is a direct connection between their faith and what happens to our companies that are investing abroad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394014">I am a little surprised that the Conservatives would allow voluntary guidelines to replace an ombudsperson with a counsellor. It does not seem to be consistent with many of them and their work within faith communities and the grassroots communities that we all work with. I challenge those within the Conservative caucus to take a look at the private member's bill here, take a look at their response that took two years and really measure it. I challenge them to talk it out with some of the people who are behind these initiatives in their faith communities. I think they would have a different opinion than the opinion they have provided. I challenge the members of the Conservative caucus to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394015">In summary, this is the way forward to get responsibility in our investments abroad. This would ensure that Canada's name is solid and that the article we saw in <I>The Globe and Mail</I> yesterday about Canada's reputation will not be repeated. This would ensure that when we have mining companies in South Africa, Latin America or anywhere else in the world where Canada is involved in enterprise, we will not be seen as exploiting people, nature or any of the other conditions that we seem to be exploiting. We need this and we should support it. I stand here gladly supporting this initiative and my party will as well.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1394016">Mr. Speaker, the members for <Affiliation DbId="128204" Type="2">Scarborough—Guildwood</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="128521" Type="2">Dartmouth—Cole Harbour</Affiliation> have already spoken very eloquently to this question, as have others I will just add a few brief comments from my own perspective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394017">Once we lived in a disconnected world, protected by distance, geography, oceans, mountains and deserts. Once governments and corporations could do anything they wanted, wherever they wanted to do it without any real consequences. That is no longer the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394018">Now we live in a very connected world. Economic problems do not respect borders or distance nor do greenhouse gases, disease or security. What we do in one place as governments and corporations affects all of us at home in our place. That is the reality of the global world in which we live.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394019">As to the impact of corporations on international relations, let us look at the history of the last 50 years, at the last century and more in Central America, South America, Africa and the Middle East and at what some companies have left behind. As the member for <Affiliation DbId="128579" Type="2">Ottawa South</Affiliation> has said, they have left tailings and environment degradation, but some companies have also left a resentment toward the home countries of those companies that many years and decades later still define the relationship between those two countries, still define the understandings that those citizens have of those foreign countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394020">Those are immense consequences for all of us, not just the companies, to deal with. It is those realities that are behind the need for Bill <Document DbId="3640419" Type="4">C-300</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394021">About two years ago, I was in Sudan and Darfur and, like everyone else, I was haunted by Darfur. I tried to imagine what possible resolution there might be to its ongoing tragedy. What was so clear and so frustrating was the capacity of a country, Sudan, and its president, no matter the vehemence of world opinion, to do what it wanted to do if it wanted to do it with no real transforming consequences, to bog down, to distract with false hope, to wear out the patience, whatever, to do what it wanted to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394022">Every governmental representative I spoke with from Canada and from other countries and every NGO said the same thing, that they were having no real impact on changing President Bashir's direction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394023">Only one country and one company could have an impact if they choose to do something and that country was China and the company was the state company of China Petroleum. Almost 80% of Sudan's GDP came from oil and the great majority of its oil goes to China Petroleum.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394024">With China and China Petroleum's ongoing support, despite other sanctions and despite being charged by the International Criminal Court, Bashir knows he can continue on. What will be the results for Africa, for the world and for China's future in Africa? There are consequences of our global and corporate actions halfway around the world, and big consequences for the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394025">One other thing I heard again and again in Sudan and Darfur was, “Where's Canada?” Beyond the aid offered, where was the voice, the diplomatic voice with those of many other nations that was needed to help bring this situation toward a human resolution?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394026">What I kept hearing was that Canada had no idea how influential it was, that we had no history as a colonizer, no history of intervening or imposing on other nations, militarily or economically, and that we had no real history of exploiting and taking advantage of local governments and local populations. They trust us and know they can work with us. They know our reputation and it is a well-earned reputation. Our reputation is precious and it matters. It matters now and it will matter in the future.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1394027">In this global world, nobody is really the big guy. Even the United States, with all of its power, economically and militarily, nobody is truly that big and that powerful in a global world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394028">Our challenge for the future, even more than economic, environmental or security, is the challenge of getting along, and that means working with others and talking, listening, negotiating and compromising. That means trusting and being trusted. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394029">That is our history and our instinct. That is our reputation and we cannot put it at risk. What Canadian companies do outside our borders matters.

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="128485" Type="2">Mr. Dean Allison (Niagara West—Glanbrook, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1394030">Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to rise in the House today to speak about our Conservative government's commitment to promoting corporate social responsibility, or CSR practices, for extractive sector companies operating abroad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394031">I am very encouraged by the progress our government has made over the years with regard to CSR. This government not only encourages this approach to doing business but sees an active role for itself in supporting companies to develop and implement CSR practices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394032">In this regard, we share the goal of this bill in ensuring that Canadian companies follow the best possible practices at home and abroad. However, I am concerned that legislating corporate activity forces companies to follow a bureaucratic set of rules rather than to be innovative and create best practices that respond to a particular circumstance. The CSR best practices for one company in one region may not be suitable for another company operating elsewhere.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394033">Not only would Bill <Document DbId="3640419" Type="4">C-300</Document> limit the scope of CSR activities for Canadian companies by being too prescriptive, it would severely impair the ability of this government to provide the necessary guidance and assistance to avoid or mitigate potential problems. I should also point out that Bill C-300 is unnecessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394034">The Canadian government's departments and crown corporations, implicated in the legal framework proposed by Bill <Document DbId="3640419" Type="4">C-300</Document>, already have in place a number of policies and guidelines to ensure that their clients are good corporate citizens. The Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade is undertaking a comprehensive initiative to improve the capacity of its trade and diplomatic offices in Canada and abroad, so that they will have the information and tools that they need to provide timely and effective CSR counsel, advice and advocacy to our companies operating abroad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394035">A key element of this government's CSR approach has been adherence to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development guidelines for multinational enterprises, which recommend voluntary benchmarks for responsible business conduct. The Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade is home to Canada's national Contact point, a senior level official responsible for promoting awareness of the OECD guidelines and for reviewing reports of specific instances of non-compliance with these guidelines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394036">In addition, Export Development Canada, or EDC, established in 2005 a compliance officer to enhance its transparency and accountability. Much like an ombudsman, the compliance officer operates independently from EDC management, reviewing complaints from stakeholders and promoting dialogue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394037">Withdrawing the support from these organizations provided to Canadian companies, as Bill <Document DbId="3640419" Type="4">C-300</Document> proposes, would restrict access to vital services and financial capital. It would be counterproductive to promoting CSR best practices within the extractive sector and would put Canadian companies at a serious competitive disadvantage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394038">Furthermore, the proposed legislative changes would not have their intended effect. Cutting companies off from government assistance after they encounter a problem overseas is precisely the wrong thing to do. It would only serve to exacerbate the issue, further damaging Canada's reputation and that of our companies operating abroad. The preferred approach of this government is to give them the tools and information they need to avoid these problems in the first place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394039">As we know, in 2006 the government hosted a series of national round tables on CSR and the Canadian extractive sector in developing countries. Following these round tables, the advisory group presented their recommendations on how Canadian companies could meet or exceed leading international CSR standards and practices. Since the conclusion of the round table process, the government has met with representatives of the extractive industries and civil society in a variety of fora to continue the dialogue on a number of issues related to trade and development, including CSR.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394040">On March 26, 2009, the Conservative government tabled its new CSR policy in Parliament, entitled “Building the Canadian Advantage: A Corporate Social Responsibility Strategy for the Canadian International Extractive Sector”. This new strategy was developed through consultations undertaken with a number of stakeholders, including the national round tables, as well as recommendations raised by the former Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394041">“Building the Canadian Advantage” will improve the competitive advantages of companies in the Canadian international extractive sector by enhancing their ability to manage social environmental risks. This strategy is founded on four key pillars, which I would like to outline today.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1394042">The first pillar calls for continuing assistance from CIDA for developing-country governments to enhance their capacity to manage natural resources in a sustainable and responsible manner. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394043">The Conservative government recognizes that resource governance, transparency and accountability in developing countries are critical to ensuring that the extractive sector contributes to poverty reduction. These factors are also essential for creating a business environment that is conducive to responsible corporate conduct in countries where Canadian companies operate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394044">The first pillar builds on existing initiatives where CIDA has played a key role. For example, in Peru, CIDA has worked extensively with the government, mining companies and affected communities to develop regulatory requirements for social and environmental management. CIDA has also assisted Bolivia to establish a tax collection unit for hydrocarbon, generating over $1 billion in annual revenues that have been reinvested in public services for impoverished Bolivians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394045">The second pillar of the strategy calls for the promotion of internationally recognized voluntary CSR performance and reporting guidelines. Building on Canada's adherence to the OECD guidelines, the government will promote the following international CSR performance guidelines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394046">First is the international finance corporation performance standards on social and environmental sustainability for extractive projects with potential adverse social or environmental impacts. This is the de facto performance benchmark for projects in developing countries that require substantial financial investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394047">Second is the voluntary principles on security and human rights for projects involving private or public security forces. At the 2009 plenary in Oslo, Canada was welcomed to this process as the first engaged government under the new participation framework. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394048">Third is the global reporting initiative, or GRI, for CSR reporting by the extractive sector to enhance transparency and encourage market-based rewards for good CSR performance. The government will work with stakeholders to develop GRI supplements for oil and gas and junior mining companies. These widely-recognized international standards will form the basis for Canada's commitment to increasing the quality and quantity of voluntary CSR reporting by Canadian companies operating overseas. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394049">The third pillar of the strategy involves support for the development of a new CSR centre of excellence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394050">The government is currently discussing with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum in Montreal to provide a home for the CSR centre of excellence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394051">Finally, the fourth pillar of the strategy calls for the creation of a new office of the extractive sector CSR counsellor. This office would be responsible for providing assistance in the resolution of social and environmental issues related to Canadian companies operating abroad in this sector. The counsellor will review and document the CSR practices of Canadian extractive companies operating abroad and advise stakeholders on the implementation of CSR performance guidelines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394052">Requests for review by the counsellor may originate from an individual, group or community, or their representative, that reasonably believes that it may be adversely affected by the activities of a Canadian extractive company outside Canada. The counsellor will undertake reviews with the full consent of the involved parties. The counsellor will issue a public statement after each review and submit an annual report to be tabled in Parliament by the <Affiliation DbId="128690" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394053">The strategy calls upon all Canadian companies working internationally to respect all applicable laws and international standards, to operate transparently and in consultation with the host government and local communities, and to develop and implement CSR best practices. The strategy also proposes a voluntary dispute resolution process that ensures fast and effective results, while remaining independent and at arms reach from government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394054">To conclude, I would like to reiterate that the Government of Canada, including the departments, agencies and crown corporations implicated in this bill actively support CSR principles and have independently taken steps to promote social responsibility. Corporate social responsibility is absolutely essential in a globally competitive, well-regarded extractive sector. However, Bill <Document DbId="3640419" Type="4">C-300</Document> is not an efficient, effective nor desirable mechanism for achieving this end.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1394056">In the 38th Parliament, a similar but much stronger member's private bill was presented by the former leader of the NDP, Ed Broadbent. New Democrats have long stood for corporate accountability as a principle of international trade. I strongly believe that Canadian companies who operate overseas must be held to the same standards as they are in Canada.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1394057">Canada must see to the protection of workers, their families and the environment everywhere Canadian companies operate. I realize that that is what this legislative measure is trying to do. Unfortunately, I do not think it succeeds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394058">Bill <Document DbId="3640419" Type="4">C-300, an act respecting Corporate Accountability for the Activities of Mining, Oil or Gas in Developing Countries</Document>, is not perfect. Its scope and application are too limited, and its enforcement mechanisms lack teeth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394061">There are three main areas of concern that I have with this piece of legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394062">First, the bill should be expanded to include all incorporated companies in Canada, not just companies receiving support from the Government of Canada. This is a significant loophole that would greatly weaken the application of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394063">Second, the legislation should include additional provisions within the Criminal Code to strengthen its enforcement mechanism and to ensure that all companies operating in Canada have the same legal duty to protect workers' rights in their foreign operations as in their domestic operations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394064">Third, this piece of legislation should establish an ombudsman to carry out the provision of this legislation rather than relying on the minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394068">As usual, the Liberal caucus and its members claim to uphold certain principles, in this case that of corporate accountability, but again they fail to deliver effective legislation to enshrine those principles into law. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394066">While I always welcome progress on a matter of global corporate accountability, Bill <Document DbId="3640419" Type="4">C-300</Document> would only encourage a fraction of companies operating in Canada and would have no meaningful enforcement mechanism. In other words, this bill is only aimed at encouraging companies to respect the principle of corporate accountability and not enforcing such behaviour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394067">Bill <Document DbId="3627517" Type="4">C-298</Document> is a far more effective piece of legislation. The hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128204" Type="2">Scarborough—Guildwood</Affiliation> should consider putting forth or accepting two amendments to his bill similar to clauses contained in Bill C-298, especially the establishment of an ombudsman.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="00">(1400)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1394071">Overall, I feel that these issues can be resolved at the committee level, which is why I will support this bill through second reading. The most troubling thing about this bill is that it is a private member's bill. The Conservative government should be making this issue a priority and investing the appropriate resources to finally address this concern.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1394075">As a retired steelworker and Vale Inco employee I know first-hand how important it is that we stand together as workers to protect each other. I have worked for close to 35 years for a mining company which has operations outside of Canada and I want to show my solidarity with my brothers and sisters throughout the developing world by supporting the bill through second reading.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394076">As the late Rosemary Brown said, “unless all of us are free, none of us will be free”.

Canadian companies can and should be leaders in corporate social responsibility, which is what my colleague from Scarborough—Guildwood is trying to do. We are trying to lead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394079"> Why is there a need for this? In Sudan, oil is fuelling the conflict in Darfur and will fuel the catastrophe that is likely to come in the southern part of the country. We have seen the worst humanitarian catastrophe in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since World War II. More than five million people have been killed and more than 1,000 people are dying day in and day out. This conflict has been fuelled with coltan, a substance that we have in our BlackBerries, cell phones and other electronic products, and by diamonds and gold. These products are being mined and taken out by private companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394080">In Burma it is rubies and oil. In Nigeria, oil is fuelling a catastrophic problem in the delta in that country. When I was in Belize I tried to stop a Canadian company from Newfoundland that was poised to build a dam. It did build the dam which destroyed the largest central contiguous jungle and rainforest in Central America. A Canadian company did that, which is why the bill is needed and more so because we know it is the private sector that can help developing countries to become self-sufficient.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394081">It is no thanks, of course, to our government which stripped CIDA from supporting eight African countries that need our help, including countries like Zambia, Malawi and Cameroon that are trying to get back on their feet, but what does the Canadian government do? It removes the funding and puts it into countries in South America and the Caribbean because that is were it wants to do business. It is a naked effort on the part of the government to forsake our humanitarian objectives for commercial objectives, not understanding that commercial objectives and humanitarian objectives go hand in hand. That is where the bill sits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394082">The bill would provide businesses with a framework to operate in these difficult countries, a framework that involves an obligation to account, report and adhere to the environmental standards that all Canadians want our companies to embrace. In doing so, they would lead and set an example, not only for other companies but for the recipient countries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394083">The biggest challenge developing countries have is not from the lack of aid they receive externally but from the predatory governments that are riven with corruption. They cannot provide the environment to enable them to have an economy that functions properly and a government that is unable to provide for the basic social needs of its people, including health care and education. They lack the capacity and that is where aid would come in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394084">However, there is also a role for the private sector. Through the bill, the private sector would benefit from better profit if it would treat the local populace well, the environment well and work to build capacity so that a developing country will be able to take care of itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394085">One of the cruellest things we do is persist in the standard myths that we have today that more money is the answer. We need to build capacity in developing countries. We need to invest wisely. We need to enable and obligate domestic governments to operate in a way that is not predatory and not riven with corruption. The private sector has an important and effective role in this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394086">Talisman is one Canadian company that has done a very good job in providing a framework for corporate social responsibility for its own company. I am very impressed with its initiative and I have talked about it often because when Canadian companies do a good thing, as the Talisman did in this case, they should be applauded.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="05">(1405)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1394087">The Canadian government has a role. By working with the private sector, as my colleague is doing, we can provide the framework for the obligation to report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394088">When the European Union put forward the obligation for European countries to report what they spent in developing countries, the EU found that corrupt officials were far less likely to ask for money back. It caused a diminishment of the amount of money that was moving back and forth under the table, an act that is so corrosive to the ability of any country to remove the cancer and blight that is corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394089">It is an obligation of the Canadian government to move this forward. It is also an obligation for the government to set standards and to behave in a way that is responsible, congruent with good environmental principles, good social policy, good technical support and transparency in order to set an example for the private sector and for other countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394090">We would like to see Canada branded as an international model for corporate social responsibility. We want to recognize companies as leaders in corporate social responsibility. We would also like to ensure that we disseminate best practices. This is very important, because whenever I have been in other parts of the world, I have seen the great hope and possibility. I have a particular interest and passion in sub-Saharan Africa. More than 50% of the world's natural resources sit in sub-Saharan Africa. Our extractive industries are there. Many of them are in war-ravaged places, like the Democratic Republic of the Congo. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394091">We need to facilitate and encourage those companies to operate in a way that does not contribute to the disasters that exist in those parts of the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394092">I have a proposal right now, through supporting the Heal Africa Hospital in Goma. Goma is the epicentre of the rape crisis. My proposal is to ask Canadian companies working in the extractive industries there to fund a $1 million infrastructure project to provide for the expansion of the only hospital there. Many of the people there have suffered horribly. In many of the villages, 70% of the women have been raped. Those women have suffered horrible injuries. This lone hospital, run by Dr. Joe Lusi and his wife Lyn, is the last and only opportunity for these people to be treated, so we are asking Canadians companies to help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394093">Companies, interestingly enough, would also benefit in their own way because their profits would increase. The health of the working population would improve and the companies' relationship with local areas would improve. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394094">What is absent in the world today is a leader who recognizes the private sector as the best engine of growth within developing countries and provides the tax base and infrastructure that these countries need to be self-sufficient.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394095">Aid is not the answer. It is a myth to suggest that it is. To use Nigeria as the example, it has generated some $230 billion from oil over the last decade. This far exceeds by orders of magnitude the amount of money Nigeria could possibly receive from aid. Yet people who go there see a country riven by poverty where the people are no better off than they were as far back as 10 years ago. Why is that so? Where has that money gone? That money was provided by private companies, big oil-producing companies. This bill would enable us to build the framework. In the case of Nigeria, that private money could be used transparently to build capacity and the judicial, political, economic, social and public sector framework that is the only hope of a country like Nigeria to become self-sufficient.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394096">In closing, I want to thank my colleague for introducing the bill. All of us in the Liberal Party fully support it. Instead of trying to be obstructionist about it, the government should roll up its sleeves, get behind the bill and support it for the good of our country, for the good of our private sector and for the good of some of the most impoverished countries in the world.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1394097">Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all hon. members for their contributions to this debate. Naturally I prefer some members' opinions over others, but nevertheless that is the nature of debate. I thank each and every member who has contributed over the last couple of hours of debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394098">We are in the final hour of debate on second reading and Bill <Document DbId="3640419" Type="4">C-300</Document> will go to a vote on the principle of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394099">The need for CSR supervision has already been decided. It no longer forms part of the debate. All sides agree, even the government, that there is a need for some form of CSR supervision. The debate has moved from should we do something to really how we should do it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394100">It may have taken the government a number of years, but on March 26, in its press release, the Government of Canada effectively admitted that there was a serious CSR issue in our country and in the extractive corporate sector. If there was no such issue, then there would have been no such announcement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394101">Now we will talk about whether Bill <Document DbId="3640419" Type="4">C-300</Document> is the best response, or Bill C-298 or the government's press release.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394102">As I said at the beginning of the debate, ideally the government would have taken over this issue and framed the response around the creation of an ombudsman, an independent officers of Parliament. Regrettably that did not happen. Now we have three choices: the government's press release, or CSR lite, as I have taken to calling it; private members' Bill <Document DbId="3627517" Type="4">C-298</Document>, creating an ombudsman; or Bill <Document DbId="3640419" Type="4">C-300</Document>, reposing the responsibility in the two ministers with sanctions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394103">Unfortunately Bill <Document DbId="3627517" Type="4">C-298</Document> requires a royal recommendation and for reasons alluded to earlier in the debate, would be dead on arrival as it proposes something that a private member's bill cannot do, namely spend taxpayer money. Only government with the approval of Parliament can do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394104">As delighted as I would be to support the NDP party, both for its previous member, the member from Halifax, Alexa McDonough and the member from Ottawa Centre, Ed Broadbent and currently the member for <Affiliation DbId="128755" Type="2">Ottawa Centre</Affiliation> in Bill <Document DbId="3627517" Type="4">C-298</Document>, unfortunately this would be an exercise in futility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394105">That really leaves Bill <Document DbId="3640419" Type="4">C-300</Document> or CSR lite.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394106">Bill <Document DbId="3640419" Type="4">C-300</Document> proposes a scheme of accountability which would include an ability to investigate, make findings, deal with frivolous and vexatious claims, report to Parliament and gazette the results. The government proposes an order in council appointment to assist in dispute resolution. Bill C-300 proposes a modest array of sanctions with BDC, EDC, CPP and various promotions. The government proposal is free of consequences for any offending company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394107">Bill <Document DbId="3640419" Type="4">C-300</Document> proposes a review and report to Parliament. The government response, CSR lite, proposes a report by various ministers, and the tabling of that report by the Minister of International Trade to Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394108">Therefore, should we not just declare a victory, issue a press release, pat ourselves on the back and go home? While I like and respect the <Affiliation DbId="128690" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation>, even he does not think that he is going to be the Minister of International Trade forever. A new minister may well not be so enthusiastic about CSR and may withdraw the order in council appointment. What a prime minister can make, a prime minister can also unmake.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394109">The only meaningful protection is legislation. Bill <Document DbId="3640419" Type="4">C-300</Document> is legislation. A press release, followed by an order in council appointment, is not. Legislation has to be repealed by an act of Parliament. An order in council proceeds at the whim of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394110">The effectiveness of the councillor is dependent upon the consent of the involved parties. Bill <Document DbId="3640419" Type="4">C-300</Document> does not depend upon the willingness of the accused party to co-operate. In fact, it presumes the opposite. Bill C-300 may not have as optimistic a view of human nature as does the government, but possibly it is just a little more realistic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1394111">While joining hands and singing <I>Kumbaya</I> may be a wonderful experience in Muskoka on a glorious summer night or even Haliburton, it does not cut it in the harsh light of daily life, let alone operating a business in some dreadful conditions.</ParaText>
