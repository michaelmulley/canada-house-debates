</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Danny Virtue, one of my 
constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Virtue lives in Mission, B.C., and has recently built a 
40,000 square foot motion picture studio, making it one of the 
largest in the world.  He was one of the creators of the award 
winning Neon Rider series which was filmed primarily in Mission. 
He also manages the old west bordertown set in Maple Ridge, also 
in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Virtue has worked on over 300 TV shows and motion pictures 
including the movie <I>Seven Years in Tibet</I>.  The CBC-Alliance 
Pictures show <I>Nothing Too Good for a Cowboy</I> is currently 
being filmed at his studio ranch in Mission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Virtue has won an international award for superior 
educational and community programming for children.  He employs 
over 100 individuals and his business ventures add a great deal 
of economic stimulation to the local economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask all members of the House to join with me in congratulating 
Mr. Danny Virtue and to wish him success in all his future 
endeavours.  He is living by his wits and more in Mission.

budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see additional moneys for education and for health.  Above 
all, we see that he is to end voice mail as a system of answering 
government phones in New Brunswick.  Away with the press 1, press

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a dandy initiative and we hope that other government

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is with deep regret that I inform the House of 
the death of a true icon in the sport of harness racing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>John G. Hayes was a legendary luminary in racing circles.  He 
did it all.  He was an owner, trainer, driver and breeder of 
champion horses such as Sharp N' Smart, Penn Hanover, Conquered, 
and the charismatic chestnut stallion Strike Out that won the 
world's most prestigious pace, the Little Brown Jug.  John Hayes 
was outspoken and opinionated.  He could be obstinate but above 
he was a winner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My fellow parliamentarians will appreciate his commitment to 
horse racing by this typical Hayes comment.  When asked “Why did 
you come to Ohio”, he replied “Sure as hell not to run as 
governor but to win the jug”, and win he did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sincere condolences to Mrs. Hayes, his daughter Elizabeth and 
his son John Jr., a very talented veterinarian and horseman in 
his own right.  I know that Sam will carry on his dad's 
tremendous legacy in the true Hayes tradition of excellence.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 'tis the 
season of giving.  As the holiday season approaches I call upon 
all Canadians to strongly support their grassroots charities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowhere is the plight of the poor more apparent than here in the 
capital region where over 30,000 people, half of them children, 
rely upon food assistance services each month.  We can all begin 
by giving generously to our local foodbanks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentary interns, with the support of the Canadian Bankers 
Association, are once again organizing a food drive and require 
our support.  Non-perishable food and cash donations can be 
dropped off at the cafeterias and canteens on the Hill. 
Collection boxes will remain open until Friday, December 11.  The 
interns will also be visiting our offices this week to collect 
cans and cash donations.  All proceeds will be matched by the 
Canadian Bankers Association.  Last year they raised $2,100. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should support this praiseworthy initiative and give 
generously.  On behalf of all MPs, a very special thanks to our 
interns.

<P><A NAME="LINK13"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings—Frontenac—Lennox and 
Addington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, two local citizens from my 
neighbouring riding of Kingston and the Islands, Mr. Ian Milne 
and Ms. Margaret Angus, have undertaken an initiative entitled 
“Kingston—First Capital” to gain official recognition of their 
city as the first capital of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kingston, which adjoins the St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario 
and is gateway to the Rideau Canal, served as capital of the 
United Canadas from 1841 until 1843.  Often referred to as the 
Limestone City, Kingston hosted the first, second and third 
sessions of the first parliament of the United Provinces of 
Canada until the capital was moved to the city of Montreal in 
late 1843. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the various buildings used for that legislative assembly, 
only two, the Kingston Hospital and the Bonsecours Market in 
Montreal, are extant.  It is truly fitting that Kingston be 
officially recognized as the first capital of our great nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I visit this historic city regularly and admire the traditions 
and the respect for history this community supports.  I applaud 
the efforts of Mr. Milne and Ms. Angus and those assisting them 
for their dedication and commitment to this worthwhile project.

that has been accomplished on the reform of the Agence de la

earlier today a delegation of Canadians met with the chairman of 
the Texas Paroles and Pardons Board to plea for a stay of 
execution in the case of Mr. Stanley Faulder, a 61-year old 
Canadian who is scheduled to die by lethal injection tomorrow in

testimony from an individual who was subsequently expelled from 
his professional association.

in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The priority is to restore public confidence in Canada's public

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
several weeks ago I asked the Minister of National Defence 
whether his department was to be cutting back on the number of 
troops to deal with the cash crunch the military is facing.  The 
reply at that time was no, they had no plans to do such a thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, however, I asked the chief of defence staff in 
committee the same question.  He confirmed what other troops of 
all ranks have been saying for some time, that there are planned 
cutbacks.

no further cuts when in fact his department was planning that

are no plans of further reductions in troop levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt, though, there are a lot of pressures. We have 
had a 23% reduction in budget in the last four years, a 30% 
reduction in troops and there are a lot of pressures that have to 
be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to continue to look at all different kinds of options 
and that is what the CDS was saying yesterday, that it would be 
responsible to look at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would be an awful lot worse off if we had to deal with the 
kind of budget the Reform Party proposed, because it wanted to 
cut $1 billion.  That would certainly reduce troop levels.

the military, the House and the country have to wait a few more

be effective anymore.

bringing in new programs that will keep his employees busy, or 
does he intend to return the money he took from the provinces

passed legislation, why has the minister not passed legislation

working together to try and come up with some kind of agreement 
on the export of bulk water.

appreciate that the minister of defence has his answer to any 
question with the word helicopter in it already memorized. I urge 
him to be earnest with Canadians. He says that he has restored 
the search and rescue helicopter fleet to full operational 
availability.  What this means, according to him, is that it 
takes 70 hours of labour for every one hour of flight time.  They 
are available less than 50% of the time.  Proficiency and 
training flights are kept to an absolute minimum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Labradors are not considered safe for full training and

we have a very high level of maintenance.  We have expert people

allow them to go in the air unless they are safe to fly. 
Obviously, as they get older they require a little bit more 
maintenance, but we are ensuring with this more maintenance that 
they are still safe to operate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
again I urge the minister to be a little more earnest with

</I></B></P><P align=left>One year ago a news helicopter had to rescue survivors of a

survivors of a plane crash in Quebec had to be rescued by another

</I></B></P><P align=left>I continue to say that we will not put aircraft in the air 
unless they are safe to fly.  We have ordered new helicopters for 
search and rescue, the Cormorant.  We are also finalizing the

objective there.  Meanwhile, we will only fly helicopters or any

</I></B></P><P align=left>On page 229 of chapter 12 of Maingot's <I>Parliamentary Privilege 
in Canada</I>, there appears the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any act or omission which obstructs or impedes either House of 
Parliament in the performance of its functions, or which 
obstructs or impedes any Member or officer of such House in the 
discharge of his parliamentary duty, or which has a tendency, 
directly or indirectly to produce such results may be treated as 
a contempt even though there is no precedent for the offence. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Leaking a committee report or the contents of in camera 
discussions among committee members before the opposition 
parties' dissenting opinions have been finalized and the entire 
report tabled in the House of Commons is an affront to the House 
and a serious breach of democracy.  What has become of members' 
sense of honour and their undertaking to respect 
confidentiality? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the seventh leak to the newspapers in two weeks. 
Are these arranged, or in any event, deliberate, since they 
always serve the same interests, those of the Liberal majority? 
In addition to being an affront to the House, they are a breach 
of democracy, since the opposition's dissenting views are 
omitted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, on December 3, you said that you did not have the 
power to curtail breaches of parliamentary ethics immediately 
when no member of parliament could be identified.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You have also acknowledged that this same statement was a case 
of contempt of Parliament.  I am therefore asking you 
respectfully, Mr. Speaker, whether the rule concerning the 
confidentiality of House of Commons committee reports until 
tabling still holds, and whether this rule must be respected in 
the name of parliamentarism and democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If so, I am asking you to consider the actions of the members of 
the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food as contempt 
of Parliament.  Also, if this is so, I am prepared to introduce 
a motion to allow the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs to investigate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the light of your present knowledge, if you consider there 
has been contempt of Parliament— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member. I have 
listened to what she said with great attention. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the hon. member said this is the seventh time the 
issue of a leak from a committee has been brought up.  The hon. 
member has not named anyone responsible for this leak.  I asked 
that the House committee on procedure look urgently at this 
matter.  It does not matter how many times we bring it up in the 
House in terms of the authority of what I can do as Speaker. I 
hope the committee will look at this matter and bring forth some 
suggestions as to what can be done in this circumstance.  I await 
word from the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another question of privilege.  Although I have not yet 
heard it, I believe it deals with another leak of some kind.  I 
would rather let this sit until we hear from the procedure 
committee in terms of giving some direction.  Bearing direction 
from there we will see what avenues remain open to us as 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will deal with the other question of privilege because I have 
no right to presuppose what the hon. member will say. If it 
touches on what I said I would ask him to be very brief in it.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>STANDING COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE AND AGRIFOOD REPORT 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK141"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will try to be as brief as possible but I want to address this 
from the point of view of the Reform Party.  I will tell you 
where we are going with this issue because it will be relevant to 
what happens in the committee on procedure and House affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a little more than embarrassing to the House for those 
people who are watching at home to hear “he called me this”, 
“that's a terrible name” and “I am offended”.  This is place 
getting more like an elementary school than a House of Commons. 
I think it is quite embarrassing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I would like the hon. member to please deal 
with his question of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will talk briefly about 
the agriculture situation because we did verify today that it is 
in fact a leak from the committee.  The media have the full 
report in their hands.  I will not bore the House by quoting the 
rules. By now we have seen enough precedents in the House in the 
complaints we have had to last a lifetime.  I will get right to 
the details of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote exactly what was said in a Canadian Press story of 
today: “In a report obtained by the Canadian Press, the 
agriculture committee calls on the finance minister to provide 
farmers with a safety chute to save them from the market free 
falls like the one currently threatening to drive thousands of 
families off the land”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That actually exists in the report.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later on CP accurately quotes the report even further.  Some 
members were named in this story but I do not want to get to 
that.  I do not think the issue is who.  It is the fact that it 
is even being done.  I want to put this in context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To date and without combing through every clipping since 
September, I came up with quite a list of leaked reports.  I 
mentioned some of them the other day, the defence committee's 
third report, the fisheries fourth report, the sport committee 
report, the prebudget finance committee report, the child custody 
report, the foreign affairs report and now the agriculture 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure there are members in the House who have knowledge of 
other reports.  I could provide more I am sure.  Leaking a 
committee report is technically contempt of parliament.  However, 
there are similar examples of making announcements outside the 
House that are not considered contempt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 31, lists a 
number of things that are not considered contempt.  Section (10) 
of this citation states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question has often been raised whether parliamentary 
privilege imposes on ministers an obligation to deliver 
ministerial statements and to make announcements and 
communications to the public through the House of Commons or to 
make those announcements or statements in the House rather than 
outside the chamber.  The question has been asked whether Hon. 
Members are entitled, as part of their parliamentary privilege, 
to receive such information ahead of the general public.  I can 
find no precedent to justify this suggestion.
