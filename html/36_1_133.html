</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday my hon. colleague, the member of parliament for 
Palliser, made some very serious charges in the House.  The hon. 
member said that in the course of a private conversation he 
overheard on a flight from Ottawa to Fredericton that I discussed 
events relating to the RCMP Public Complaints Commission inquiry 
into events at APEC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I categorically deny that I engaged in an inappropriate 
conversation that would in any way prejudice the outcome of that 
inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was seated with another passenger in the course of a two hour 
flight from Ottawa to Fredericton.  We had a wide-ranging 
conversation covering various subjects.  At no time did I 
prejudge the outcome of the PCC inquiry, nor did I suggest that 
my role was to prevent the Prime Minister from attending the 
inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I have much respect for the independence of the PCC and 
its civilian oversight function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I am determined to allow this inquiry to run its course 
and establish what happened at APEC and why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, I fully understand the responsibilities of the Solicitor 
General and would never jeopardize my lawful duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I am personally offended that the hon. member has 
chosen to impugn my integrity, my ethics and my commitment to 
this process, particularly since these attacks were made by a 
political opponent who spent two hours eavesdropping on a private 
conversation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were only two parties to this conversation, myself and Mr. 
Fred Toole.  I would now like to table a letter from Mr. Toole 
which supports what I have just told the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I thank you for allowing me to rise on this 
question of privilege and to state for the record what really 
transpired.  I am not going to say anything further about what we 
discussed because this was a private conversation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have full confidence in the independence and impartiality of 
the PCC and I would ask all hon. members to give the hearing 
process a chance to work. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Colleagues, this is clearly not a 
question of privilege.  It is a dispute as to the facts, as they 
may or may not be, depending on one point or the other.  I am 
going to rule that it is not a question of privilege.  The 
statement is on the record, but it is not a question of 
privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Mr. Speaker, may I respond very briefly 
to say with great— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I have ruled that this is not a question of 
privilege, as we understand it in the House, so the matter 
is closed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would add this addendum.  I will not allow the tabling of this 
document at this time.  There are other means by which the 
minister can do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the hon. member for Palliser, although his name 
was mentioned in this non-question of privilege, at this point my 
ruling is that there is not a question of privilege.  Of course 
the hon. member has other means at his disposal if he wishes to 
pursue any other points which he deems to be valuable to this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now going to proceed to the orders of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if this is not considered a 
question of privilege— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I ask the hon. member if this deals with 
the question of privilege that I have ruled on because that point 
is over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Kilgour:</B>  No, Mr. Speaker, it is separate.  The 
House can do anything it wishes by unanimous consent.  I would 
ask for unanimous consent to table the letter in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We now have before us in this House a 
request for unanimous consent from one of our members to table 
a document in this House.  Does the House give permission to 
put this question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Permission denied.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
It seems to me that it is quite possible for the minister to 
table this document under Tabling of Documents, which will happen 
in Routine Proceedings fairly shortly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Standing Order 32(1), a minister is allowed to table any 
document relating to the administration of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  There is no question about that.  The hon. 
parliamentary secretary is correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Surely if the minister is to make a statement or table a document 
in this House it should pertain specifically to that which the 
minister is responsible for and not a document that has been 
created to cover up any particular tracks in an investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We are going to proceed with the rules of 
the House.  The hon. parliamentary secretary gave information to 
the House which is correct.  Any one of us can see that if we 
just look at the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have anything in front of me right now except the 
statement that I concurred with.  Now we will proceed to the 
daily routine of business.

Lloyd Bergeson of Cremona, Alberta who lost their daughter Denise

</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would amend the Criminal Code to add that where a

provide a urine sample to enable proper analysis to be made in

urine, breath or blood.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I move that the first report of the Standing Committee 
on Fisheries and Oceans, presented to the House Monday, March 23, 
otherwise known as the east coast report, be concurred in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has now tabled its response to the east coast 
report.  The east coast report was tabled in the House by the 
chair of the standing committee on March 23, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to be a member of the standing committee that 
produced this report especially as it was a unanimous report in 
almost every respect.  The crises in the fishery were seen by the 
committee to be of pressing importance, and this report was put 
out directly in response to these issues on the east coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had an opportunity to accept this report as a 
breath of fresh air, an opportunity to create a new mandate, a 
chance to change the status quo defensive posture of the 
department and embark on some vital changes.  Instead, the 
government has chosen to challenge the report and to shoot the 
messenger, in this case the chair of the standing committee, the 
member for Gander—Grand Falls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The east coast report has 23 recommendations.  The first 9 deal 
with foreign fishing concerns.  In particular, recommendation 9 
talks about extending our jurisdiction to beyond 200 miles. 
Reform was instrumental in having this become a focus of the 
report.  In fact, the importance of conserving natural resources 
is stated Reform policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe governments have a responsibility to protect our 
environment and if extending Canada's economic jurisdiction over 
the entire Grand Banks is what it takes to protect this 
environment, then we should do it. Reform policy is that Canada 
should assert its control over the nose and tail of the Grand 
Banks and the Flemish Cap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rest of the east coast report addresses such important 
issues as rationalizing the fisheries, the management problems at 
DFO, overfishing of particular species and sealing and ecological 
issues such as ghost nets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government response to the east coast report of the standing 
committee is pathetic.  It is typically bureaucratic and merely 
defends the status quo.  It appears to say a lot but does not 
commit to any effective change.  It avoids the real question on 
TAGS which is the mismanagement to date and the breaking of a 
promise to continue benefits to May 1999.  It does nothing 
substantive on seal populations beyond consultation and 
information gathering.  It shoots the messenger rather than deal 
with foreign fishing recommendations of the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of government response illustrates the attitude of the 
minister and senior department officials toward any investigation 
into commercial foreign harvesting off Canada's east coast.  A 
prime example of this attitude can be found in the issue of my 
request for access to foreign fishing observer reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to focus much of my comments today on these foreign 
fishing observer reports.  There is only one reason why the 
public is denied full access to reports from Canadian observers 
on foreign vessels fishing inside Canada's 200 mile limit.  The 
reason is that this government cares less about the public 
interest and Canada's sovereignty than about maintaining 
comfortable relationships with foreign fishing interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For anyone who has any doubt about this, I recommend the 1998 
book by Michael Harris <I>Lament for an Ocean</I> regarding the 
collapse of the east coast cod fishery.  However, members should 
consider reading this book only if they are able to control their 
emotions.  They will be sickened by how political timidity leads 
to horrendous consequences; in this case biologically for our 
fisheries resources and socially and economically for Atlantic 
Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many months members of the Standing Committee on Fisheries 
and Oceans and I have been trying to get DFO to release to the 
public these foreign fishing observer reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister tried to cut a deal with us.  The committee members 
could look at the reports but they could not talk publicly about 
their contents.  The minister claimed this was because the 
reports contained confidential commercial information and 
releasing them would violate section 20 of the Access to 
Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 20(6) states that the head of a government institution 
may disclose any record if that disclosure would be in the public 
interest as it relates to public health, public safety or 
protection of the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public interest in knowing what foreign vessels are up to 
far outweighs any potential prejudice to the third party, in this 
case foreign vessels.  In this case the public has an 
environmental interest in knowing if certain species of fish are 
being overfished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said in response to my questioning that he had an 
opinion as to why he should not release the reports to the 
committee.  I asked for a copy of this opinion and I received it. 
It is very enlightening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To set the backdrop for this scenario, there is a strong body of 
opinion that parliamentary committees do have the authority to 
compel any persons, papers and records as witnesses before the 
committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a paper produced by the parliamentary legislative services 
branch, it also made the point that when considering whether to 
compel evidence, committees have been more likely to excuse 
matters for reasons of national security than for considerations 
of commercial interests.  The minister has declared that these 
reports contain confidential information or trade secrets.  The 
burden of proof should be on the foreign vessels to do this.  It 
should not be up to the minister to so declare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These observer reports are produced by public authorities in 
order to protect the public.  As Justice Jerome stated in 
Intercontinental Packers Limited v Canada, the reports must 
therefore be presumed to contain public information.  This has 
been tested in the courts before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this backdrop, what was the opinion given to the minister 
by the deputy minister as to the request by the chair of the 
Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans to receive these 
foreign fishing observer reports?  On February 5, 1998 the deputy 
minister informed the minister by memo that the committee request 
was not yet of the status of a formal access to information 
request.  In other words, the minister should give the committee 
request less credence than a request under the Access to 
Information Act. Also, the chair should be consulted about 
reviewing the documents in camera. The committee turned that 
suggestion down flat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If confidentiality is involved, as in camera states, that would 
muzzle the members and would not serve the public interest. Since 
that time we have seen the department fulfil an access to 
information request and provide these very same foreign fishing 
observer reports to a member of the media, heavily blacked out of 
course. Then the department made a grand production of presenting 
these very same heavily censored observer reports to the 
committee. This of course did not satisfy the committee request 
in any way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of respecting committees of the House of Commons, the 
minister has treated the fisheries committee with disdain. 
Instead of pursuing the public interest, DFO has catered to 
foreign interests. 
The minister states in his response to the standing committee's 
report on the east coast fishery: “The perceptions of foreign 
fishing as relayed in the report are of great concern to the 
department”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government continues to defend foreign quotas on Canada's 
continental shelf inside and outside the 200 mile limit.  If we 
listen only to the government we might think that DFO had 
developed a new attitude, that DFO had seen the light.  It might 
even look to some like the poor practices which led to a collapse 
of confidence in the department were being changed by new 
attitudes at the top. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here to tell the House there is no new attitude. The 
stonewall continues. An aide to the minister tried to cut a deal 
with me to drop my formal request for the observer reports.  The 
net result would have been that I would have received the same 
censored reports that the media and the committee had already 
received.  My request for papers is still on the order paper.  It 
is still on the books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am waiting for a response I would like to pursue the 
issue of Canadian economic jurisdiction over the continental 
shelf off Canada's east coast.  It is not well known that when it 
comes to our continental shelf Canada is in a unique position. We 
are the only nation with a major portion of our continental shelf 
extending beyond the 200 mile limit, more specifically the nose 
and tail of the Grand Banks and the Flemish Cap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Grand Banks are a part of what were once the richest fishing 
grounds in the world.  The area outside the 200 mile limit is 
still heavily exploited by foreign fishing interests.  Yet the 
fish we find on the Grand Banks are part of the important food 
chain for strictly Canadian fish that often live most of their 
lives in wholly Canadian waters.  Some are highly migratory and 
cross the 200 mile limit unpredictably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee recommends that Canada gain control over all 
resources that lie on Canada's continental shelf and the 
department responds in bureaucratese saying Canada cannot do this 
and that foreign overfishing after all is not as bad as it used 
to be.  Why does the department say this rather than consider the 
merits of the argument? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans knows there are 
legal experts who agree with the committee recommendation to 
extend its jurisdiction beyond 200 miles.  They agree that all 
foreign fishing outside and inside the 200 mile zone should stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly this would be controversial.  Our soft touch foreign 
affairs department might balk at suggesting such a thing, but we 
know there are legal experts not only in foreign affairs but in 
other organizations and federal departments who agree that 
Canadian jurisdiction can be extended from 200 miles to 350 miles 
to include all of the Grand Banks and the Flemish Cap. I highly 
recommend that members read sections 76 to 84 of the Law of the 
Sea for further elaboration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the chair of the standing committee, the member for 
Gander—Grand Falls, wrote to the minister when the minister 
threw the east coast report recommendations back at the 
committee. The minister wants no part of upsetting foreign 
interests or promoting Canadian economic and biological interests 
by extending our jurisdiction.  We continue to cater to and sell 
out to Cuban and European fishing interests rather than express 
our sovereignty to the maximum degree possible over the 
continental shelf.  Until the government does this, everything 
Canada does on the east coast is a compromise.  We all know that 
compromise is not the answer. It is a sure fire way to continue 
to sell out Canadian interests at the expense of Atlantic 
Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The area of seabed in question is enormous and the stakes are 
huge.  Canada has every right to exert its legal authority in 
jurisdiction out to 350 miles.  Given the horrendous economic and 
social consequences that Atlantic Canada has already suffered, we 
also have the moral authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department has its shirt in a knot with concerns about the 
standing committee's report on the east coast because of 
criticism of DFO's handling of foreign fishing.  This does not 
bode well for government acceptance that Canada's approach to 
jurisdiction over our continental shelf must be focused and 
aggressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's current attitude is “resistance is useless”.  I hope 
we can save Canadian interests from Canadian government apathy. 
If there was ever a need for strong visionary leadership from the 
government to establish Canada's interests on the east coast the 
time is now.  Rather than supporting the status quo the minister 
should be setting a new course.  It is time for boldness, not 
timidity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee has pointed the way and will continue to promote 
this vision unless it is totally neutered by the government.  DFO 
has the reputation of being the most difficult department of 
government to deal with to solve longstanding problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time the policies of DFO impact directly on the 
lives of tens of thousands of Canadians.  Rather than a fresh 
approach we can add the removal of the chairman of the committee 
to the long list of people stifled by the government in its 
arrogant belief that disagreeing with the PMO, the government or 
a minister is not to be tolerated.  This flat, bland, tasteless 
do nothing government should be doing more than reaching for the 
pepper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have just to ask the auditor general, the ex-chief actuary

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to get the member's comments on a few 
issues.  He focused his discussion primarily on the observer 
reports and made a lot of comments on foreign overfishing.  Those 
were key recommendations in the report.  He talked about where he 
had requested observer reports.  The minister has denied access 
to them even though he has the authority to release them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks ago—and this was raised in the House last week—we 
learned again that the minister had negotiations with foreign 
nations to have observers put on all foreign fishing vessels.  We 
learned that the minister moved zone 3L which gave access to our 
shrimp to foreign nations.  He sold out again and gave our shrimp 
away to foreign nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member's comments on that.  I would also like 
him to comment on whether he believes the recent firing of the 
member for Gander—Grand Falls had anything to do with this 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in terms of any dealings we 
have with our fisheries portfolio in terms of foreign interests 
the member can be assured that Canada's interests will take 
second fiddle to either public relations or to some other deal 
that is cut for some other industry, whether it is automotive or 
whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's natural resources, our commodity industries, are 
continuously sold out by our foreign affairs department in 
collaboration with the other departments in charge of our natural 
resources.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole question of foreign fishing observers getting 100% 
coverage would only occur, given the government's posture, if 
they were prepared to trade something off.  The fact that we 
traded off and sold out some shrimp areas to the Europeans to 
achieve that would come as no surprise to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many ways to spin a story on where we sit with regard 
to the previous chair of the standing committee.  There is no 
doubt in my mind, according to the news which came out with the 
announcement of his chairmanship last year, that it is a 
challenge to the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A letter was sent to the minister this year saying that the 
committee's focus would be on the whole question of expanding 
Canada's economic jurisdiction to 350 miles off the east coast. 
That is the prime reason for his removal.  No one can convince me 
that his removal was voluntary.  It was initiated by the minister 
and the department.  There is no question about that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am absolutely 
amazed that the member opposite could have his facts so wrong. He 
either has not read the response from the minister to the 
fisheries report or he has not tried to understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I admit that the standing committee on fisheries has done very 
good work.  However, the member opposite is doing fishermen in 
the country a major disservice when he tries to leave the 
impression that if foreign fishing could be done away with there 
would be no problem.  He knows very well that foreign fishing 
today is not the problem that it used to be.  Foreign fishing is 
under control.  Canadian fishermen have never picked up the 
quotas offered to them partly because of cost and partly because 
the economic returns are not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a lot of respect for the member opposite.  I was very 
disappointed when he was fired as chief critic for fisheries of 
the Reform Party because he was doing a good job and not trying 
to create the rage, myths and perceptions he is trying to create 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me directly ask a question of the member.  Is it a fact that 
he was fired because he was co-operating with the government too 
much?  Is he now trying to get back on the committee by creating 
these misconceptions and myths to please the leadership of the 
Reform Party? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I understood we were supposed to be on questions and comments and 
that the questions and comments should be relevant and relative 
to the discussion at hand, not rhetoric like we are hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member is correct.  After a 
member has made a speech the general tenor of the debate is to 
allow fairly wide-ranging comments and questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is directing questions to the hon. member for 
Vancouver Island North.  He is about to ask a second one.  I know 
he would not want to take too long in order to give the hon. 
member for Vancouver Island North a reasonable opportunity to 
reply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I believe my questions are 
relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to review them, why is the member opposite playing games? 
Is he trying to get in the favour of the leadership of the Reform 
Party?  Why are Canadian fishermen not picking up the quotas that 
have been offered to them and that foreigners are not utilizing? 
We are not meeting our full TAC requirement on various species.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is that happening?  Will he not admit that the observer 
reports were offered to the Standing Committee on Fisheries and 
Oceans in camera and that the fisheries committee including 
members opposite denied that request?  Obviously they just wanted 
to play games. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too have much respect for 
the parliamentary secretary for fisheries.  We sat on the 
committee together last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could never be accused of co-operating with the government.  I 
can co-operate with some government members but, lo and behold, 
if anyone catches me co-operating with this government please let 
me know and take me away in handcuffs or something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member bounced all over the place, but I mentioned in my 
speech that we were offered those observer reports in camera.  I 
also explained why it was such a bad idea for the committee to 
accept that offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not doing a disfavour to fishermen in terms of trying to 
expand Canada's influence to include all its continental shelf. 
Quite the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a lot of living examples.  The more we comprise 
management by trying to cater to other interests, the more 
problems there will be.  The west coast complexity of creating an 
aboriginal fishery on the Fraser River, a destination bound 
fishery, compromised all the up coast fishery and the mandate of 
the department. It is no different on the east coast with what is 
inside and outside the 200 mile but on the continental shelf.  We 
have the same kind of compromise.   No, I am not doing this to 
curry favour with my own party.  I am driven on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there have been 
discussions among the parties and I understand, if you seek unanimous 
consent, that you will find it for the following:  that a vote on

requested and the vote deferred until 5.30 this evening. 
Therefore a vote would take place later in the day and the House 
could now proceed to orders of the day.

moved that Bill C-52, an act to implement the comprehensive 
nuclear test ban treaty, be read the second time and referred to 
a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, in introducing second reading on the 
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, I think it is very 
important to remind members of the House of a very important 
decision that was taken by our predecessors well over 50 years 
ago. At that time Canada, who had participated in the Manhattan 
project, had the full capacity, knowledge and resources to become 
a nuclear power state if it had so desired. Our predecessors, our 
government of the day and parliament made a decision against 
that.  We were the first country to acknowledge and decide to 
become a non-nuclear state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are here to add to that legacy, to make a further 
commitment in that very historic decision.  We are here to 
continue the work committed to by so many Canadians over the last 
five decades in dealing with the nuclear threat to the world.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have done a lot since then to persuade the other countries 
that nuclear arms are a problem and not a solution to world 
security.  For example, we put a lot of energy into creating a 
plan to free the world of nuclear arms sooner rather than later, 
while permitting peaceful uses of nuclear arms to continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also true that Canada has paid a political and economic 
price for sticking to its convictions, but its positions have 
never changed.  We have on a number of occasions chosen not to 
sell our nuclear technology. 
We have always encouraged countries without nuclear arms and 
those with them to honour their international obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These difficult achievements are now threatened.  The 
credibility of the non-proliferation regime is being sorely 
tested. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all recognize since the spring of this year that once again 
the nuclear genie has been unleashed in the world.  We are faced 
with a new argument for nuclear realpolitik.  The tendency argued 
now by people in authority in Pakistan and India and with their 
supporters is that somehow the possession of nuclear weapons 
should endow one with a new status, a new credibility, that 
somehow the possession of this nefarious weapon gives one a new 
position in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This once again puts into play the fact that nuclear weapons are 
simply becoming a currency in the power play of international 
politics. This puts at serious risk the progress we have made to 
turn back the nuclear clock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today as we debate this very important piece of legislation, we 
must rededicate ourselves to the ultimate goal of a world without 
nuclear weapons.  They still constitute one of the great threats 
to all humankind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The nuclear tests by India and Pakistan put in harsh perspective 
the ongoing threat of proliferation.  They diminished rather than 
improved regional security for those nations themselves.  In fact 
increasing instability developed in the region.  This was 
recognized and acknowledged at the regional meetings of the ASEAN 
and ASEAN Regional Forum which I attended this summer.  All the 
countries of that region, with the exception of the perpetrators, 
took a strong stand in denouncing this because of the threat to 
security in the region itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may have set an example perhaps more serious to those other 
countries which are tempted to be proliferators.  One of the sad 
facts of life is that the resource, the technology of developing 
nuclear weapons, is becoming cheaper and easier.  With the 
breakdown of nuclear arsenals in some of the former states, the 
transfer of knowledge and scientific expertise becomes even more 
dangerous.  In the absence of international censure, recognition 
of nuclear weapon state status really puts pressure to the 
expansion of a nuclear club. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come to this House today in that through our discussions we 
can alert more Canadians to that threat.  This subject cannot be 
taken lightly.  It is not a subject for playing partisan 
politics.  It comes down to the basic fundamental question of the 
survival of humankind faced with this awesome weapon we have had 
to live with for over half a century. 
I know that members of the House will treat this situation with 
the seriousness and commitment it deserves.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why Canada took a stand of strongly condemning these 
actions.  The Prime Minister at the G-8 meetings led the charge. 
We have rejected justifications and have taken steps to ensure 
that there will be no rewards given for those who want to acquire 
the weapons.  Proliferation needs to be stopped dead in its 
tracks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the report that the Standing Committee on 
Foreign Affairs is working on in its examination of Canadian 
interests in a nuclear policy. I understand it could be ready as 
early as this fall.  The committee canvassed Canadian views on 
this matter.  It will be an opportunity for us to once again 
address this issue and provide a strong Canadian voice in this 
most crucial of all matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it very clear to the House that it is not simply 
a matter of stopping those who decide to test and proliferate. 
It is equally important that we continue the pressure, the 
argument and the persuasion for those who possess nuclear weapons 
to maintain and enhance their commitments to nuclear disarmament. 
That is the other part of the equation.  It is not simply enough 
to stop the spread, we must continue to work toward the 
reduction.  That is also part of the commitment we have to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say very clearly that not all nuclear weapon states 
are living up to their obligations under the non-proliferation 
treaty.  The START II treaty still is stalled.  Other commitments 
being made are discounted.  I hope this House can speak with a 
unified voice on the need not only to arrest proliferation but to 
pursue an active commitment for the ongoing reduction of nuclear 
weapons and the dismantling, disjunction and delinking of those 
weapons so they do not constitute an ongoing threat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must as a parliament and as a country stand very firm against 
the new realpolitik that is being expressed around the world, and 
we are in a position to do so.  Oftentimes in the tough 
neighbourhood we live in internationally, questions are not 
always as clear cut as we would like them to be.  If 50 years ago 
our predecessors in this House and the government had the courage 
to say no to nuclear weapons, we should have that same conviction 
today and make it clear in terms of what we do in this 
legislature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to pay tribute and remind ourselves of how much 
effort we have put into these initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 there was an indefinite extension of the nuclear 
non-proliferation treaty with the Canadian motion to have it 
reviewed in a consistent fashion to make sure that the 
obligations were met. Just a year ago in 1997, we had the entry 
into force of the chemical weapons convention, another weapon of 
mass destruction we are trying to put a fence around and trying 
to control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agreement has begun in Geneva to start talks on the production 
of nuclear materials, fissile materials for nuclear weapons. 
These are being chaired by one of our distinguished Canadian 
foreign service representatives.  We are also strongly working on 
and encouraging nuclear weapon states to agree to the Canadian 
proposal for discussions on nuclear disarmament issues at the 
Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.  Further, we are actively 
pursuing negotiations on the convention on banned weapons in 
space. It is important that we bring all these things together in 
a seamless web, in a context that each part builds a whole.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case the legislation before the House today on the 
comprehensive test ban treaty is an indispensable part of a 
non-proliferation regime.  It is one of the key elements in which 
international consensus has been developed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that nuclear testing undermines the basic goal of 
non-proliferation.  The comprehensive test ban treaty objective 
is to end all nuclear test explosions in all environments.  That 
is the commitment that has been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CTBT is a strong deterrent to the development of nuclear 
weapons.  It is probably stronger than virtually all other 
disarmament treaties because it will help constrain the 
development of new nuclear weapons and any attempt to provide 
improvements, refinements and more sophistication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It therefore contains within it the message that nuclear weapons 
must be reduced and constrained.  They cannot be the weapons of 
choice by an expanding number of countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clandestine testing under this treaty will be virtually 
impossible to do.  States will need to think long and hard about 
any secret efforts.  One of the reasons we took as strong a stand 
as we did a few months ago on the question of the inspections in 
Iraq was for that very reason.  We cannot allow any state in a 
clandestine way to perpetrate the growth and expansion of weapons 
of mass destruction of any kind. That is why we have to be 
consistent in our approach to this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CTBT also puts a very important international monitoring 
system in place, perhaps one of the most detailed networks around 
the world, to detect nuclear explosions wherever and whenever 
they may occur.  We will participate by having 15 monitoring 
stations in Canada alone which the Department of Natural 
Resources will be responsible for.  This will make sure that we 
contribute in a very substantial way with the resources of 
Canadians to the overall international network to provide that 
kind of monitoring, warning verification system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also establishes a very clear global norm against nuclear 
testing by all nations.  While there are 150 signatories, there 
are still countries outside.  However, as has been made clearly 
evident in the case of the land mines treaty which is now 
becoming a treaty into force, once it is there it begins to 
establish a broad standard that even non-signatories feel obliged 
to obey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the information of members of the House, during the visit 
last week of the Chinese foreign minister, he announced that 
while China was not ready to sign the treaty, it was making a 
financial commitment to the United Nations for de-mining 
activities.  Anyone who says the land mines treaty has not had an 
impact should have been with me last week when the Chinese 
foreign minister committed to a major conference and made a major 
financial commitment for de-mining purposes. This shows that 
global norms can work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conclusion of the comprehensive test ban treaty fulfils one 
of the longstanding goals we have been pursuing.  We took an 
active role in the negotiations and if we wish to remain leaders, 
our actions now must match our words.  It is in the power of this 
chamber to give life and meaning to the commitment we made during 
those negotiations. Therefore, I want to make the case that the 
earliest possible ratification of this treaty by this House would 
be a very strong and powerful message around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation before the House contains all the necessary 
elements to allow us to fulfil our obligations under the test ban 
treaty.  Once passed, it will criminalize any nuclear test 
explosion or any other nuclear explosion undertaken in Canada for 
the purpose of developing or improving nuclear weapons.  It is a 
tough but necessary position in order to make our message clear. 
It also mandates the respective functions of the Departments of 
Foreign Affairs, International Trade, Natural Resources Canada 
and Health Canada into a comprehensive test ban treaty national 
authority which will administer Canada's obligations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will obligate Canadian industry to report to the national 
authority chemical explosions of a magnitude of 300 tonnes or 
greater or TNT equivalent, as these explosions could be confused 
with nuclear explosions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not an onerous demand on our industry and in our 
consultations they are certainly more than willing to comply 
because they recognize that it is in their interest and the 
interest of the broad international community that we be full 
participants in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the central aim but it is also important to recognize 
it provides very important benefits for Canadian technology 
because much of the verification, monitoring, equipment and 
facilities are Canadian made and Canadian developed.  Therefore 
we will be able to provide that kind of extension and also have 
it in place for recognition and use in other forms of 
verification systems as we pursue our disarmament goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Adopting the legislation will allow us to be among the first to 
ratify and will lend legitimacy to the efforts of this country as 
we pursue the crucial issue of combating the new conventional 
wisdom of nuclear realpolitik.  It basically says that Canada has 
not changed its position for 50 years.  We stand against 
proliferation and that by having the treaty in hand and being one 
of the early ratifiers we will be able to say that our efforts 
are backed up by the people of Canada through their elected 
representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe Canadians want us to do that.  As we touch the 
mainstream of feeling in the country no issue comes more to the 
surface than the expectation that through parliament and our 
government we will use all our energies possible to advance a 
level of humanitarian law, disarmament activities to provide a 
safer and secure world for the men, women and children throughout 
the globe.  That is the expectation of Canadians.  We have an 
opportunity to fulfil that today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no better demonstration of Canada's resolve to 
safeguard non-proliferation to advance the issue of human 
security and no better reflection of the will of the Canadian 
public than to support unanimous rapid passage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I close with a statement by George Washington, the first U.S. 
president.  It is one I have often been reminded of in the work I 
do.  In speaking to his last session of Congress he said: “Let 
us raise a standard to which the wise and the honest can 
repair”.  We have that opportunity to raise that standard to 
which all the wise and honest around the world can repair.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
certainly my pleasure to speak to Bill C-52, the comprehensive 
nuclear test ban treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly I agree with many of the sentiments expressed by the 
minister, and I think most Canadians would also agree.  As the 
minister pointed out, we are looking at banning nuclear testing 
in this country and most Canadians would agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party agrees there should be serious penalties for anyone 
who considers this sort of action, and obviously this is part of 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree that Canadian companies should report tests of 300 
tonnes of TNT or its equivalent, as these could be mistakenly 
looked on as nuclear testing.  Our party agrees and supports the 
overall principle of the bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1150"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that is what Canadians want.  That is what our party 
stands for. I believe we are going in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I must address some of the issues I believe should be 
talked about when we look at the whole nuclear question. It is 
important that this be brought to the House and that we have the 
opportunity to debate such an important issue. I look back on 
some of the other issues that should have been brought to the 
House and that should have been debated.  Most obviously, the 
international court comes to mind. We met with that group.  We 
found out that it had a Canadian position.  It was going to head 
off this summer to Rome to negotiate on behalf of all Canadians 
and sign something that Canadians had not looked at, had not 
talked about or for the most part had no input into.  We met with 
those people five days before they left for Rome. They could not 
tell any of us what their position was.  That is an example of 
where that should have been brought to the House. Canadians 
should have had a chance to comment on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Kyoto agreement is another one.  It is going to affect every 
Canadian.  Yet it was not brought to the House.  It was not 
debated.  The facts were not put out.  Canadians did not have the 
necessary input.  Most of the provinces, now that they are 
getting some of the details, do not agree with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could talk about UN conferences.  We could talk about the 
conference in Beijing.  It talked about the issues of women which 
most Canadians and this House did not have input into.  We could 
talk about Cairo and population.  The position put by Canada is 
probably contrary to a great many positions that Canadians would 
hold.  We can go on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least we have a chance in the House to talk about this 
nuclear treaty.  That goes a long way in why we might support the 
government's position on this because we have a chance to express 
our point of view and our concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at this we can find some of the good points which 
the minister pointed out.  We can talk about the advanced 
technology which now allows us to detect nuclear testing around 
the globe.  It is interesting, however, that the CIA was severely 
reprimanded for not advising the U.S. Congress about the 
potential test in India.  It is interesting that somehow that 
fell through the cracks.  Heads rolled because of it.  It does 
make us a little uncertain when this treaty says we can detect 
nuclear testing around the world and yet we have an example this 
past year where something went wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were told about the monitoring systems.  I had the 
opportunity to look at some of those monitoring systems.  We have 
satellites in place.  We have nuclear waste being weighed and 
measured.  We have detectors that will detect if a slight bit of 
waste product has been taken out of the container.  A satellite 
will immediately alert us to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This trust in technology is good.  I still wonder if it is 
totally foolproof.  We have to ask that question.  We have to ask 
our technical people to be sure that these are failsafe systems 
and that nothing can go wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The American way at looking at things for the most part has been 
to take the James Bonds and the Maxwell Smarts out of the 
equation and go strictly to satellites and technology.  I am 
concerned that we may be putting too much trust in that 
technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian industries are the very much the leaders in remote 
sensing techniques.  We have a great deal of industry that will 
benefit from treaties like this as we sell our technology around 
the world.  We can certainly benefit from a business standpoint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that this government make it very clear that we 
should be part of any international on site inspections.  We are 
technically able to do that.  We have the equipment, we have the 
know how.  It is important that we be part of that examination. I 
can talk about why Canada should do that, being equipped to do 
that better than most countries.  I will save that for another 
time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have reservations about this test ban treaty and I think it 
is important for the record that we help the government to look 
at what these reservations might be and hopefully as it 
implements this it will take these recommendations into 
consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First there is the cost.  The bureaucracy that is going to be 
created by this government in order to impose this test ban 
treaty is quite extensive.  If we look at the added bureaucracy 
we will find that not only do we have a disarmament ambassador 
but we have the pyramid of infrastructure and of bureaucracy that 
goes with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has created a national authority for the CTBT 
implementation.  In other countries, for instance Britain, they 
have put it under the minister of defence and have said handle 
that under the existing bureaucracy.  We have set up a whole new 
bureaucracy, a whole new building of bureaucrats examining the 
implementation of this treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been here long enough now to see what happens as these 
pyramid builders, these bureaucracy builders, take over. 
Certainly we would advise the government when it says it is going 
to spend $8.5 million this year on this initial implementation 
committee, do not let that grow any bigger, do not let that thing 
balloon out to become this huge bureaucratic nightmare we have in 
this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess a bigger concern we have is that while we agree with the 
expressions of the minister and we agree with what he had to say, 
we have this terrible feeling that the minister is possibly 
leading us into a path of folly, that this minister is in this 
idealistic world, one which many of us passed through in the 
1960s. We got over it and we now know about the realities of the 
1990s and the realities of the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a minister who is a political dreamer, who believes that 
because you talk about it and you say it, it will be so.  I want 
to expand considerably on what the reality is out there in the 
real world when it comes to nuclear energy and nuclear weapons 
and what the real world is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now in 1998 entering the 21st century and I believe it is 
vital that we warn Canadians as the minister said about some of 
the difficulties which we face.  I have to look at some of the 
quotes the minister has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the question and answer section on this which we were 
provided with, there is a quote which I think fits the minister 
very well is: “Canada's long term goal is to ensure that the 
treaty enters into force, continues to be an effective 
non-proliferation instrument and contributes to the ultimate 
elimination of all nuclear weapons”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is motherhood.  We would all like to not have any nuclear 
weapons.  The problem is that is so far from reality that we 
wonder where the reality in the minister's mind really is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could list other quotes where he says that the United Nations 
is where everything happens and as long as we are represented in 
the United Nations we can trust that everything will be fine and 
we will not have to worry about these nuclear problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am afraid again that is not a world I could be that 
comfortable with, trusting the United Nations talk shop to solve 
all the problems of the world today.  I do not have that level of 
confidence and I think many countries would follow in that line 
as well. Let us talk about the reality that I believe the 
minister has missed when he talks the way he just did in this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 36 countries that have the capability to develop 
nuclear weapons.  That includes Canada.  We have the START II 
agreement between Russia and the U.S. to get rid of nuclear 
weapons which is not being enforced but which was supposed to be 
enforced a good two years ago.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>START III is totally stalled and is not going anywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we examine the Russian situation, it is pretty easy to 
understand what is happening.  The Russians are in economic free 
fall.  They have lost their conventional means of defence. Russia 
is not a world player by any sense of the imagination, except 
that they have nuclear weapons.  The only thing that makes Russia 
a world player and a G-8 member is the fact that they have a huge 
nuclear arsenal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How are we going to convince a nationalist Russian politician, 
or any Russian politician, that Russia should not be a world 
player, that they should get rid of their nuclear weapons just 
because it would be very nice if they did that?  It is not 
realistic to think that could happen in the foreseeable future. 
Would we like it to happen?  There is no question.  Everybody 
would like it to happen, but it is not reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to worry about the countries that are not going to sign 
this treaty.  It is great that Canada signed it on September 24, 
1996, but we are not a threat to the world.  The fact that we 
signed it is not what is significant.  The significant factor is 
the fact that the other guys, who I want to talk about, did not 
sign it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider the example of India and Pakistan.  The minister 
referred to India and Pakistan a number of times.  India has 
close to a billion people.  It is a huge country.  India has 
wanted to be a superpower for a long time.  India feels it should 
be a world player because of its numbers and its growing economy. 
India is jealous that China is taking the focus position of the 
west.  India feels unhappy that there are only five permanent 
members of the UN security council.  India wants to be one of 
those members.  They have clearly said that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>India is saying that Russia is on the inside and it is asking 
why Russia is on the inside.  Russia is on the inside because it 
has nuclear weapons.  China is on the inside because it has 
nuclear weapons.  So India says that it will be on the inside too 
if it has nuclear weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is flawed thinking.  The minister said that and I agree 
with him, but that is the reality of India's thinking.  We were 
there in July and August and we got that message from the people 
at the top of the Government of India, from the foreign affairs 
committee and from the foreign affairs minister.  They clearly 
stated that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>India backed Russia during the cold war, which was sort of 
getting on the wrong horse, but that is history.  India has the 
fourth largest military in the world, with one and three-quarter 
million troops trained, armed and ready to go to war.  They have 
a huge population and poverty problem.  It is a country of 
contrasts and diversity.  They have a new government with the 
BJP, a coalition of 19 parties.  They are raising their 
popularity through nationalism.  Having nuclear weapons is 
popular because that makes them more powerful and they will 
certainly get attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that intelligence has said that India would be 
able to produce or have between 25 and 65 nuclear weapons. 
However, we are being told today that India possesses 455 nuclear 
weapons.  It is a real problem if we think India has 25 and they 
have 455.  That is a huge problem and a huge threat to mankind, 
as the minister said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go on to Pakistan, a country of 120 million people. 
They have 600,000 troops.  Fifty-two per cent of their budget is 
spent on military.  Twenty-seven per cent is spent on debt 
servicing.  That leaves 21% for everything else.  That is a huge 
economic problem.  Pakistanis have their backs against the wall.

today feels marginalized and ignored, but they have nuclear 
weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the nuclear issue to see its significance.  India 
tested five nuclear weapons in the spring of this year.  The 
Indian politicians made statements “We are about to end the 
existence of Pakistan.  We will attack them in Kashmir and take 
Kashmir back and then we will disrupt and destroy the Pakistani 
nation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a pretty serious charge.  Obviously Pakistani 
politicians were listening to that pretty carefully.  They have 
been in three wars since 1949.  The most recent was in 1971 when 
Bangladesh was taken away from them by an Indian victory.  It was 
then, of course, set up as a separate state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine the emotion on the day when Mrs. Bhutto took the bangles 
off her arm and threw them at the prime minister, saying “You 
are weak.  You are as weak as you could be.  You must counter 
what India has done”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Pakistan government sent envoys to all countries.  They sent 
all of their members of parliament off to visit countries to find 
out what the other countries thought the week after the Indian 
tests.  They went to the G-8 and said “What are you going to do 
to guarantee us our security?  We think, and here are the 
reasons, that India is about to attack us”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the west offered very little.  The G-8 came out with a 
weak-kneed, wishy-washy statement.  So the Pakistanis said “We 
must test our nuclear weapons because that puts us on an equal 
footing”.  This is how this sort of thing happens.  Is it right? 
No, it is wrong.  But that is how these kinds of situations 
arise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have the issue of Kashmir, an area 100 miles by 150 
miles.  There are 600,000 Indian troops there.  It has been 
reported that 50,000 people have been killed.  Shellings are 
occurring every day.  There are some peacekeepers, but they are 
not allowed to patrol most of the areas.  It is a hot spot.  It 
is a real hot spot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked to members of the foreign affairs committee in 
Islamabad.  We looked at the issue, just as we had done in India, 
and we asked the same questions.  The chairman of the foreign 
affairs committee said very clearly “We are like a cornered 
animal.  But we have the political will.  We have the people 
behind us.  We have religion behind us.  And we have nuclear 
weapons.  We will use them and in 90 seconds 80 million people 
will be dead”.  In 90 seconds 80 million people will be dead. 
That is what we are talking about.  That is the reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are signing a treaty and talking about a piece of 
paper, the reality is that there is a crisis.  What should we do? 
In this case Canada is perfectly positioned to do something. 
Remember, we do not have baggage.  We have a reputation.  We are 
members of the G-7.  We are friends with Japan, China, India, 
Pakistan, France, Britain and Germany.  We are friends with all 
of the countries involved and we can negotiate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of counting on this old-time politics of signing things, 
we should be there.  We should be at that hot spot and we should 
be saying “Look guys, here are 10 issues”, 20 issues, however 
many issues you want to put on the table, “and we are going to 
talk about these issues”.  Of course, at some point it would be 
hoped that Kashmir could be one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is positioned to do that.  Russia was involved with 
India, so it is out.  The U.S. was involved with Pakistan, so it 
is out.  China is too busy economically, so it is out.  Besides, 
China would not be accepted by Japan.  Japan is interested, but 
it has an economic crisis.  The U.S. is busy.  Monica is keeping 
them busy.  No one is as perfectly positioned as Canada to do 
something.  This government should not just talk about it and 
condemn it and impose sanctions.  That is not the way to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foreign affairs minister's office called me the day before 
we were leaving for India and Pakistan and said “Don't go.  We 
are not allowing our ministers to talk about Pakistan and India. 
We are not allowing them to meet with Pakistan and India and you 
are sending the wrong message by going there”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were sending the right message by going there.  We are the 
diplomats who could do something.  We could do something about 
this issue.  Instead of just standing around talking, we could be 
there to solve the problem.  That is action.  This government 
should be setting an example by doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has a role.  We have a moral role that we could play in 
this situation.  We could talk about power.  Pakistan has all 
kinds of hydro power that could easily be traded with India. 
India needs it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are natural transportation routes.  There are relatives on 
both sides of the border who want to meet with each other.  There 
are 100 million people who could trade with each other.  There 
are all kinds of things that would cause India and Pakistan to 
solve their problems if somebody were just there to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of slapping on sanctions, screaming and shouting and 
condemning them, let us help them.  Let us help both sides to 
solve this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not take time to go into as much detail on some of the 
others, but I will refer to them.  Let us talk about Iraq. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Iraq had UN inspections, but again it is challenging the world. 
It is challenging the world that is so involved with all these 
other issues that it is determined that nuclear, biological and 
chemical weaponry will be developed in that country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who suffers?  The people of Iraq.  If we really care about the 
21 million people of Iraq, then we should be doing something to 
solve this problem, and not just with a slap on the wrist.  That 
is not the kind of action that works any more.  It might have 
worked in the days of the cold war, but it sure does not work 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>North Korea constantly threatens that it will again start its 
nuclear program.  It has acute famine.  The only thing it has 
going for it is the nationalistic concept which the minister 
spoke about of this nuclear proliferation and development that 
makes it more powerful.  That creates serious instability in the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sudan is a country of 31 million.  Well over two million of them 
are starving to death.  It was 15 years at war, destroying crops 
and destabilizing its neighbours.  There are all kinds of 
problems for the Canadian businesses which are trying to do 
business there.  I point these things out because this is the 
reality of where it is really at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have 100,000 troops on the Iranian-Afghanistan border. 
We have the Shiite muslims who make up 89% of Iran faced off 
against the Taliban, the Sunni muslims who make up 84% of 
Afghanistan.  They are within days or weeks of a major outbreak, 
a major conflict, occurring in that region. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are all kinds of reasons Iran can say that it can develop 
whatever arsenal it takes to quell these sorts of problems. 
Obviously there is drug money involved.  Huge amounts of drugs 
are being brought from Afghanistan into Pakistan.  All kinds of 
instability is being created in that region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Signing that piece of paper does not deal with Iran, with 
Afghanistan, with Iraq or with North Korea.  We just do not deal 
with them by signing this piece of paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could talk about Israel and Palestine.  We could talk about 
Taiwan and China.  We could talk about Turkey and Syria. Turkey's 
troops today are massing on the Syrian border. There are all 
kinds of such areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another interesting piece of information is the improvement of 
missiles by various countries.  The bragging rights are as 
follows:  Saudi Arabia can now reach a range of 2,800 kilometres; 
Israel, 1,500 kilometres; Iran, 1,300 kilometres; Libya, 550 
kilometres; and so the list goes on of bragging rights about what 
they can do to each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real world that we are not talking about in the House is 
threatened by those kinds of states.  That is where it is at.  It 
is not signing a UN document and hoping all the good guys will 
not proliferate nuclear weapons.  That is not where it is at. 
Where it is at is:  What will all these guys do who could care 
less about this sort of treaty? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To hold out the treaty and say it is the answer, the be all and 
end all as we heard the minister say, is leading Canadians down 
the wrong path.  Canadians should not feel pious and great 
because we are signing a nuclear non-proliferation treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be wonderful, in the wonderful world of 1960 of the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, if that would end everything.  The 
white picket fence, the little dog and the wife in her apron are 
30 years or so out of date.  It is just not the real world.  The 
real world is not all that friendly and we had better realize 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also realize what the Canadian role is.  Our role is a 
leadership role internationally.  Over 80% of Canadians say that 
is what they want Canada to do.  We will not be a superpower.  We 
will not use weapons but we can use the weapon of diplomacy. That 
could be our strongest ace in the hole and could be the thing 
that could lead us into the position of diplomatic superpower in 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To sit on our laurels and think UN treaties and UN arrangements 
are all we need is totally wrong.  The soft diplomacy that we 
have been following is not getting us very far and we are falling 
behind.  Our position in the world is definitely declining, and I 
believe we as Canadians should turn that around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To summarize, we certainly have a problem with all that 
bureaucracy.  We have a problem with the foreign affairs position 
and a minister who is living in the past.  I know this is not the 
time to ask a question, but we heard we were one of the first to 
sign and to move forward in this regard. I cannot help but ask a 
question.  We signed on September 24, 1996.  Why has taken it so 
confounded long to come through in legislation to the House?  How 
is it possible to take two years to do something that will be 
supported by everyone in Canada and by all parties in the House? 
How can it be so slow?  I guess we get used to that question but 
it borders on incompetence. 
That is something we should ask as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My fourth concern is about all the rogue states.  I have only 
talked about a few of them.  I do not want to say that these guys 
are bad, that I have included all the bad ones.  I have not.  Not 
all of them are as bad as others.   However there are problems 
that we are not facing up to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we support the signing of this treaty.  Let us 
get on with it.  Above all, let us not make Bill C-52 something 
by which to say we are wonderful and great for signing this 
treaty.  My goodness, it should have been ratified a month after 
we signed it and we should have moved on.  What should we move 
on?  That is the problem.  I have not seen a game plan of the 
government to move on in areas that Canada can do its job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can do our job in Kashmir, with Palestine and Israel, in 
North Korea and in Sudan.  We have a position that allows us to 
get on both sides to deal with the issues and to become 
diplomatic leaders in the world.  Then we could hold ourselves up 
and say that as Canadians we are proud we have really done 
something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the position the government should take instead of 
simply glorifying itself as it is so prone to do with the Canada 
accord and all kinds of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I just wish to convey to the House the minister's apology for not 
being present for this debate.  He has been seconded to other 
more pressing issues of the moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course all the debate will be placed before him for his 
consideration, and I thank the hon. members.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, while 
the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs is undertaking its 
review of a report on nuclear non-proliferation, arms control and 
disarmament, this House is being asked to implement one of the 
instruments resulting from the international community's efforts 
to take “effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear 
arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament”. I am 
quoting part of article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation 
of Nuclear Weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty was adopted on 
September 24, 1996 and has already been ratified by 21 states, 
as the Reform Party member must know—Canada is not among the 
first ones, since there are already 21 contracting parties. That 
treaty is one of the instruments created following the 
negotiations. The states that adhered to the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons continue to negotiate in 
good faith and will hopefully achieve an ambitious objective 
that some feel is impossible to reach, namely the interdiction 
and even elimination of nuclear weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ratification of this treaty by Canada, and by other members 
of the international community, will be another step in that 
direction. 
Hopefully, the number of ratifications will multiply, so that we 
will reach the magic figure of 44 before having to convene a 
special session, under paragraph 14(2) of the treaty, to review 
the measures that could be taken under international law to 
speed up the ratification process and facilitate the coming into 
effect of the treaty at an early date.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ratification of a treaty which seeks to continue the process 
begun with the Limited Test Ban Treaty—adopted on August 5, 
1963, and to which Canada became a signatory on January 28, 
1964—will be a major step in the quest for a planet that is at 
least exempt from nuclear testing if still not free of nuclear 
weapons . 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A treaty such as the one that is the subject of the bill we are 
going to debate seems all the more necessary today—as the 
minister and the Reform Party member have reminded us—with 
countries such as India and Pakistan conducting nuclear tests 
that other nuclear power states have agreed from now on to 
abandon. These states include France and the United Kingdom, who 
made their commitment very clear by signing the Comprehensive 
Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, as well as China, the United States and 
Russia, who also suggested they would no longer be conducting 
nuclear tests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore appropriate, in the context of the present 
debate, to again appeal to India and Pakistan, as well as to 
Israel and South Korea, two other nuclear power states whose 
plans are still cause for concern, to heed the countless appeals 
already made to them and signal their intention to no longer 
conduct nuclear tests by adding their names to the list of 
nations that have already signed the Comprehensive Nuclear 
Test-Ban Treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the other signatories, these states would better serve the 
cause of international peace and security they have espoused by 
becoming members of the United Nations, and in respect of which 
they are bound to act under article 2 of the UN charter, by 
signing this treaty, which recognizes that the cessation of all 
kinds of nuclear explosions will help halt the development of 
improvements in nuclear weapons and end the development of new 
types of nuclear weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By participating in the treaty's international monitoring 
system, which will provide a means of detecting, pinpointing and 
categorizing nuclear explosions, and which will also authorize 
on-site inspections for the purpose of determining whether 
suspicious events are in fact nuclear explosions, countries will 
help move humanity one step forward along the road towards 
nuclear disarmament.  They will be helping to resolve a problem 
that originated with the use of energy in a manner contrary to 
humanity's interests, the misuse of a resource whose use for 
peaceful ends could and still can contribute to humanity's 
well-being and do us proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to announce that the Bloc Quebecois will support 
Bill C-52, subject to consideration of certain amendments to 
improve the implementing legislation. 
This bill to implement the treaty in accordance with section 3, 
appears to be essentially consistent with the treaty and its 
schedule as well as the related protocol. It is designed to give 
effect to the treaty within the Canadian legal system and it 
seems to us that it contains the necessary provisions to ensure 
obligations will be fulfilled in good faith, as required under 
the pacta sunt servanda rule set out in section 26 of the Vienna 
Convention of the Law of Treaties dealing with the comprehensive 
nuclear test ban. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amendments might, however, improve this implementation 
legislation, and I will have the opportunity a little later at 
committee and report stage to justify the Bloc Quebecois' 
proposed changes to Bill C-52.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will propose amendments to improve the 
wording of the bill in French, to make the amendment process 
more democratic in the future and to ensure that the person 
designated to act as national authority is accountable to the 
minister and, through him, to this House, for his or her 
participation in the implementation of the treaty. This bill is 
similar to the law to which his or her Australian counterpart 
will be subject under the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty 
Act, 1998, which we have examined and which requires the 
Australian director to report to the minister and the minister 
to report to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with other matters relating to foreign affairs, the Bloc 
Quebecois shares the values and convictions of the government 
party and the other parties here in this House.  The values of 
peace and international security are at stake here, as well as 
the objective of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, which 
is to take the necessary steps to attain nuclear disarmament, 
That treaty, we will recall, was indefinitely extended in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Quebec, whom our party represents here in the 
House of Commons, agree with this objective, and it is our duty 
to waste no time whatsoever in stating our agreement with any 
legislation relating to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can also state before this House that the sovereign Quebec so 
fervently desired by my party will have absolutely no hesitation 
in continuing this international treaty and in ensuring its 
implementation, as Canada intends to do today, both internally 
and internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government is today inviting us to be involved in an 
important milestone in the history of nuclear disarmament, we in 
the Bloc Quebecois are anxious to know if it will dare proceed 
further, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs led us to believe in 
the House this morning.  Will it seek to take any innovative 
steps?  Will it resist the temptation to stick with the nuclear 
status quo, or will it instead opt for taking a risk in 
connection with the nuclear challenge facing it, the 
international community and all of humankind? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate on non-proliferation, arms control and disarmament, 
which the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade will begin on Thursday, will give us some 
insight into the real policies of Canada, a middle power, a 
sometimes ambitious player. The Minister of Foreign Affairs 
demonstrated this in the crusade for the elimination of land 
mines, which he is pursuing with remarkable vigour, at a time 
when the Vancouver incidents are casting their shadow over a 
foreign policy which seems to have allowed truly questionable 
goals to take precedence over the basic freedoms of Canadians, 
of the students in Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to shedding some light on the government's attitude, 
the standing committee's proceedings will provide an opportunity 
for my party, the Bloc Quebecois, to demonstrate its desire to 
build an international community that, sooner or later, will be 
free of nuclear weapons, free of the balance of terror and of 
the terror that balance brings, “a world slightly less 
dangerous”, as Jennie Rosenberg, a doctor in Godmanchester, a 
lovely little spot in my riding of Beauharnois—Salaberry, put it 
in a letter she wrote me on September 16.

in just a few weeks, everyone is entitled to an international 
order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in the 
declaration can be fully realized, an order in which the quest 
for peace, a fragile commodity at any moment, will win out over 
the threat of nuclear war, an order in which intelligence, not

Speaker, I am pleased to rise on behalf of my colleagues in the 
New Democratic Party to support this important piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By implementing the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty Canada 
will be furthering in an important way the goal of nuclear 
disarmament. It will constrain the development of advanced new 
types of nuclear weapons, constituting an effective measure of 
nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation in all its aspects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two weeks ago this House welcomed a true hero, the president of 
South Africa, Nelson Mandela.  Mandela had just returned from New 
York where he spoke eloquently before the United Nations general 
assembly for the last time as president of South Africa.  In that 
speech he strongly supported nuclear disarmament and he spoke 
against the alarming acceleration of poverty worldwide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>President Mandela noted that the nuclear weapons states have not 
yet made a clear commitment to eliminate the bomb.  He added that 
his country, South Africa, and Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, 
New Zealand, Slovenia and Sweden would be submitting a resolution 
to the assembly to this effect.  At the United Nations he called 
on all members of the UN to seriously consider this important 
resolution and to give it their support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we welcome this legislation, I want to appeal to our 
government to heed the eloquent cry of Nelson Mandela and to join 
in this new agenda coalition seeking the elimination of these 
weapons of mass destruction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was on June 8 of this year that the foreign ministers of 
those eight countries President Mandela referred to issued a 
joint declaration.  In that declaration they note that they 
considered the continued threat to humanity represented by the 
perspective of the indefinite possession of nuclear weapons by 
the nuclear weapon states, as well as by those three nuclear 
weapons capable states that have not yet acceded to the 
non-proliferation treaty, and the attendant possibility of the 
use or threat of use of nuclear weapon.  They went on to note the 
seriousness of the recent nuclear tests conducted by India and 
Pakistan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These countries said as well we can no longer remain complacent 
at the reluctance of the nuclear weapons states and the three 
nuclear weapons capable states to take that fundamental and 
requisite step, namely a clear commitment to the speedy, final 
and total elimination of their nuclear weapons and their nuclear 
weapons capability.  We urge them to take that step now.  They as 
well noted the unanimous conclusion of the International Court of 
Justice in its 1996 advisory opinion that there exists an 
obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion 
negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects 
under strict and effective international control. That was the 
call of the foreign ministers of those eight countries, the 
so-called new agenda coalition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the Canadian people support Canada's playing a 
far more active role in this area as well.

over the course of the last two or three years such as the 
resumption by the French government of nuclear testing in the 
South Pacific. Earlier this year my New Democrat and I voiced our 
deep concern at the resumption by India and Pakistan of the 
detonation of nuclear devices.

Scientists moved the so-called doomsday clock five minutes closer 
to midnight.  It now stands at nine minutes to midnight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we condemn those tests by India and Pakistan we welcome 
some of the recent statements made by their governments 
suggesting that they are prepared to consider signing this 
important comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty provided that the 
nuclear weapon states finally live up to their commitments as 
well to work toward the abolition of nuclear weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While of course it is essential that we rid the world of any 
further nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons testing there is 
still a lot of work to be done.  The costs of this have been 
incredible.  It has been estimated that $8 trillion has been 
spent on nuclear weapons since 1945 while a large percentage of 
the world's population has gone without the most basic human 
needs being met, adequate food, shelter, health care and 
education. I note the most recent report of the United Nations 
development program which shows the gap between rich and poor 
still increasing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The world's stockpile of nuclear weapons, estimated at 36,000 
warheads, represents over 700 times the explosive power used in 
all the three major wars of this century which killed 44 million 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been since the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that the 
world has had to live with nuclear weapons.  We survived the past 
50 years fortunately without any further nuclear weapons 
exploding on innocent civilians.  But the threat of nuclear 
annihilation lives on.  Indeed there have been a number of 
studies indicating that the risk of some sort of accidental 
detonation is still far too great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned the five nuclear weapons states, Russia, the U.S., 
France, China and the United Kingdom, and the three near nuclear 
states, Israel, India and Pakistan.  I want to say a word in the 
context of Israel. I again appeal to our government to speak out 
against the shameful continued imprisonment of Mordechai Vanunu 
in Israel.  Vanunu has been in jail for many years, most of that 
time in solitary confinement solely for courageously exposing the 
Israeli nuclear project at Dimona.  I plead with our government 
to recognize that this is a profound injustice, that Vanunu 
should be freed and that our government should be speaking out 
and ending its silence on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At its peak in 1986, the total number of nuclear weapons in the 
world was about 70,000.  Today it is about half that.  South 
Africa has shown other nuclear weapons states that it is possible 
to have actually possessed these weapons and then to eliminate 
their arsenal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are currently five major international nuclear weapons 
free zones, including all the countries in the southern 
hemisphere.  The non-proliferation treaty, first signed in 1968, 
has been an important step forward and I acknowledge that Canada 
played a leadership role in the 1995 extension of this treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that treaty the nuclear weapons states in article VI have 
made it very clear.  They have signed on to this commitment. They 
said each of the parties to the treaty undertakes to pursue 
negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to the 
cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to 
nuclear disarmament and on a treaty on general and complete 
disarmament under strict and effective international control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the commitment nuclear weapons states have made but that 
is not the commitment they have honoured, and it is long overdue 
for this hypocrisy to end.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think many of us understand the point that both India and 
Pakistan have made in saying to the five nuclear weapon states 
“Don't lecture us about our testing when you yourselves possess 
these weapons and you are not prepared to honour the treaty in 
establishing timetables and goals for the elimination of your own 
weapons”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and my colleagues in the New Democratic Party today again call 
on the nuclear weapon states to honour that commitment in article 
VI, to make an unequivocal commitment to the elimination of their 
respective nuclear weapons and without delay to pursue in good 
faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations that will lead to 
the elimination of these weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues who spoke before me mentioned the work of the 
foreign affairs committee in looking at the important issue of 
the abolition of nuclear weapons. I am pleased to be a member of 
that committee and to work with my colleagues on that.  We in 
that committee have heard from a broad cross-section of 
interested individuals and organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to acknowledge some of the many individuals and groups 
who have been working with dedication for many years on this 
important issue:  Ernie Regher and Bill Robinson of Project 
Ploughshares; the newly appointed senator from Alberta, Doug 
Roche, a veritable one man disarmament machine who has done an 
extraordinary job in this area; a broad cross-section of Canadian 
churches; Peter Coombes, Gillian Skeet and many others of End the 
Arms Race in British Columbia; the many organizations of the 
Canadian Network to Abolish Nuclear Weapons; Debbie Grisdale of 
the Physicians for Global Survival; Veterans Against Nuclear 
Arms; Trina Booth of the Canadian Peace Alliance; the United 
Nations Association in Canada; the World Federalists of Canada; 
Pugwash; the Campaign for Nuclear Phaseout; and Irene and Norm 
Abbey of the Nanoose Conversion Campaign.  These are some of the 
many people and organizations that have been working with such 
dedication and conviction over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many individuals.  In the early sixties my mother was 
a member of the Voice of Women.  They were signing petitions and 
demonstrating outside shopping centres for an end to Strontium 90 
in our milk.  These are the people who have laid the groundwork 
for where we are today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention in particular the Canadian church leaders' statement. 
Its representatives appeared before the foreign affairs committee 
earlier this year.  They spoke very eloquently and very 
powerfully about the extraordinary affront to humanity for 
nuclear weapon states and their allies, including Canada, to 
persist in claiming that nuclear weapons are required for their 
security.  The church leaders said “The spiritual, human and 
ecological holocaust of a nuclear attack can be prevented only by 
the abolition of nuclear weapons.  It is our common duty to 
pursue that goal as an urgent and top priority”.  We in the New 
Democratic Party join our voices with those church leaders in 
appealing to our government and all governments to honour that 
commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although Canada does not have nuclear weapons and officially 
opposes nuclear proliferation and supports disarmament, our hands 
are not entirely clean on this issue.  We provide airspace and 
low level flight ranges for nuclear bomber training.  We host 
visits by nuclear powered and potentially nuclear armed 
submarines.  Politically and diplomatically, the Liberal 
government supports U.S. and NATO nuclear policies which 
shamefully include the option of the first use of nuclear 
weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as New Democrats believe that Canada can and must do much 
more to further the nuclear disarmament agenda.  I will suggest 
some of the things we could be doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada could join the new agenda coalition of middle power 
states as they call on nuclear weapon states to make an 
unequivocal commitment to enter into and conclude negotiations 
leading to the elimination of nuclear weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada must support immediate steps to de-alert the nuclear 
arsenals of all nuclear states, including the elimination of hair 
trigger nuclear postures and the removal of warheads from their 
delivery systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada must push within NATO for a comprehensive and long 
overdue review of NATO's nuclear doctrine, for NATO to adopt a no 
first use policy, and to support the elimination of forward 
deployed nuclear weapons.  We should not be a member of a 
military alliance that contemplates the use of these terrible 
weapons.

</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes I have spoken of should be reflected in NATO's 
strategic concept document which is due in April next year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada should vote at the United Nations in favour of 
multilateral negotiations leading to an early conclusion of a 
nuclear weapons convention.  This fall a resolution will once 
again be before the general assembly.  Last year Canada voted 
against that resolution.  I want to appeal to our government to 
reconsider and support that resolution this year when it comes 
before the general assembly and indeed show some leadership and 
co-sponsor that important resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should stop Candu reactor sales to countries with poor human 
rights records, like China and Turkey, and phase out the nuclear 
power industry in Canada generally.  We should become a nuclear 
free zone.  The Liberal government should certainly give notice 
of termination of the agreement between Canada and the United 
States allowing a torpedo testing range at Nanoose Bay in the 
Strait of Georgia, British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not be involved in any way in importing MOX fuel for 
conversion at Canadian facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government has shown leadership on land mines.  We could 
show the same kind of leadership working with civil society to 
mobilize public opinion on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before closing I want to make a couple of additional points.  I 
want to note the outstanding work of my colleagues on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague the member for Vancouver East has participated in a 
couple of citizens weapons inspection teams, the American nuclear 
submarine test facilities in Bangor, Washington, as well as the 
Electric Boat Corporations, one of areas that manufactures the 
Trident in Groton, Connecticut. She has been drawing to the 
attention of the global community the complicity of the United 
States in continuing to manufacture weapons of mass destruction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague the member for Winnipeg—Transcona has made many 
powerful speeches over the years on the scourge of nuclear 
weapons and the need to abolish them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nuclear weapons have been with us since the 1940s.  However, as 
we enter the new millennium it is time to end this nuclear 
madness and set a new course toward the complete elimination of 
nuclear weapons.  We owe it to future generations, to our 
children and to our children's children to abolish all nuclear 
weapons from this earth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The children of today are concerned.  When I speak in elementary 
schools, one of the favourite books I like to read from is 
<I>Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes</I>.  It is the tragic 
story of a young Japanese girl who was a victim of radiation 
sickness and who died as a result of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The children I speak to ask me why we allow this madness to 
occur and what are we doing to make sure it will never happen 
again.  And they are right.  That is the political leadership we 
are calling for now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to refer to a letter the foreign affairs committee 
received from retired United States General Lee Butler. He was 
one of those who were in the very leadership of the United States 
military role in nuclear weapons.  This is what he said in his 
letter to the foreign affairs committee: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is truly a sad commentary on the human condition that we are 
incapable of letting go the most bizarre and terrifying security 
construct ever conceived by the mind of man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most difficult truth I had to confront in my own 
reassessment of nuclear weapons was that for most of my career I 
had failed to grasp the moral context of these hideously 
destructive devices.  It came crashing home the day I assumed 
responsibility for the U.S. nuclear war plan and confronted the 
consequences of targeting over 10,000 weapons on the Soviet 
Union.  That is when I came to fully appreciate the brutal 
honesty of Joseph Stalin's comment on the modern age: “The death 
of a single individual is a tragedy; the death of millions is a 
statistic”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He closed by saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My country is badly in need of a new moral compass on this issue. 
We have committed the fatal sin in public policy making of 
becoming cynical and arrogant with respect to decisions affecting 
the lives of hundreds of millions of people.  We have trivialized 
the likelihood that deterrence might fail, thus providing easy 
moral cover for ignoring the consequences.  We have learned to 
live with a weapon that numbs our conscience and diminishes our 
humanity.  We need to hear voices of reason, urging us to a 
higher standard of rectitude and global leadership.  We await 
your call. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada, our government, must respond to that call by doing 
everything in our power to rid the world of the scourge of 
nuclear weapons.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure for me to stand today in the House and speak to 
such an important issue, nuclear weapons testing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Successive Canadian governments have advocated the need for a 
truly comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty for many years.  The 
Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests in May of this year truly 
brought home to all of us that the proliferation of nuclear arms 
is still an issue for the international community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as Conservatives encourage and support any effort that will 
help make the world a safer place to live in.  That is why we 
support the implementation of Bill C-52 which, once ratified by 
parliament, will allow Canada to ratify the comprehensive nuclear 
test ban treaty that the government signed on September 24, 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The test ban treaty will make it a crime to test nuclear weapons 
in the countries that have signed.  It will also require 
industries to report large chemical explosions which could be 
confused with a nuclear explosion also in the countries that have 
signed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-52 also helps define the roles of different departments, 
such as the Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade, Natural Resources Canada and Health Canada, which will 
jointly administer the implementation of the test ban treaty in 
Canada. There are a couple of questions to go along with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the test ban treaty a good thing?  The nuclear powers, 
the U.S., France, Britain, Russia and China, will not expand 
their arsenals, at least we should not say all because China 
seems to be expanding a bit.  But it does give the smaller 
countries a little less incentive to build nuclear weapons.  It 
maintains the status quo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the status quo a good thing?  Since World War II the big 
five have influenced the world and maintained relative stability 
and stability is a good thing.  It allows economies to grow 
without worrying about these threats.  We all know what has 
happened to the economies of countries that have gotten into 
these serious threats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, why would it be risky to maintain the status 
quo?  As we know there are some countries which do not like the 
status quo.  They think there is some benefit to being part of a 
nuclear club.  India and Pakistan tested in May.  They want to be 
part of this new status quo.  Iraq, Iran and North Korea all want 
to test nuclear weapons.  We must go further to discourage them 
and to rid them of these notions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This makes security an issue.  The foreign affairs committee is 
preparing a report which calls for the rid of all nuclear 
weapons.  Nuclear weapons are not land mines.  They are a 
deterrent weapon that won the cold war.  Let us not kid 
ourselves.  Asking the defence communities to get rid of nukes is 
like asking society to get rid of cars.  We have relied on them 
for too long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill does not even mention the Department of National 
Defence.  I am speaking because I am the defence critic.  The 
Department of National Defence must be involved because the 
defence of a nation is not just the job of our hippie foreign 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although India, Pakistan and North Korea have yet to sign on to 
the treaty, it remains a positive measure toward better nuclear 
arms control in the world.  By ratifying the test ban treaty, 
Canada will be part of implementing an international monitoring 
system to detect nuclear explosions throughout the world, thus 
creating deterrents to clandestine development of nuclear 
weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The implementation of the test ban treaty will also provide the 
opportunity for the international community to quickly conduct an 
inspection where there are doubts about the credibility of a 
member state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a few more things I would like to point out.  Canada 
suspended nuclear co-operation with India following its first 
nuclear test in 1974.  Canada also ended bilateral nuclear 
co-operation with India and Pakistan in 1976 when neither country 
would agree to the requirements of Canada's nuclear 
non-proliferation policy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we negotiate other Candu sales do I have to remind the 
Liberal government what happened after Canada sold its Candu 
reactors to Indian and Pakistan?  The Liberals would like us to 
believe that Canada has nothing to do with helping India and 
Pakistan to develop nuclear weapons.  Of course they were in 
power when those sales were made.  They gave them the technology 
for peaceful purposes.  They built clones.  We know the rest of 
the story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are seeing today is a Liberal government which at the 
same time it is revising the Canadian nuclear policy to prop up 
its image is negotiating sales of Candu reactors to countries 
that might just end up doing what India and Pakistan did with 
their Candu reactors.  In May 1998 the world saw what we mean 
when we talk about incompetence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind our foreign minister, who still likes to call himself a 
hippie, that nuclear weapons are a serious threat to Canadian 
security.  Love and flowers will not stop that threat. Saying 
otherwise only demonstrates little understanding and knowledge of 
what really goes on in the world.  Canadians might have been led 
to believe that the world is a safer place.  The reality is that 
it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week I watched the United States Senate arms service 
committee talk about the military problems in the States.  It was 
quite interesting.  They parallel a lot to our problems, what we 
have been dealing with for the last little while: quality of life 
and lack of money.  They are the same types of issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day when they look at the more serious 
problems they are worried about as to how they are going to keep 
up their equipment and still be stuck in one of their major 
points, the main thing they will be looking at is their strategic 
defence initiative, the famous star wars project.  That is major 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking down the road with a lot of time ahead.  Yet they 
are still considering this project.  It is a very strong item in 
their defence budget.  That means a ring of missiles completely 
around the States.  They are certainly not putting that in 
because they think the nukes are going to go away. Unfortunately, 
if they start firing these missiles, they will more than likely 
be firing them over the top of Canada.  Nukes will be dropping in 
on us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue is a lot more complicated and volatile than the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs would like us to believe.  I am not 
implying that as a country we should not work toward nuclear 
disarmament.  On the contrary I am saying that we have to do it 
in a credible way.  We have to take into account the context of 
current world events and security issues.  When 76% of Canadians 
support a leadership role for Canada in the world negotiations on 
nuclear weapons non-proliferation, they want their government to 
look credible, not gullible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a longstanding and respected member of NATO and a well 
respected member of the world community.  We have a longstanding 
partnership with countries such as the U.S., France and Britain 
with which we have forged a good relationship and developed 
mutual understanding on issues such as nuclear arms control and 
nuclear disarmament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the Minister of Foreign Affairs I only have this to say: be 
very careful; nuclear weapons are not land mines.  The minister 
asked for the full support of the House on the committee report. 
I am sorry he raised the committee report today because in my 
party's opinion the test ban treaty is a worthwhile endeavour. 
However my party should be forthright.  Nuclear weapons are not 
land mines.  Indeed my party supported the minister's efforts in 
the land mine treaty and congratulate him on his success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly we are in favour of stopping proliferation.  Certainly 
we are in favour of arms control.  The world has been, is 
currently and will be a dangerous place.  Ridding our security 
system—and let me be clear—and calling for the U.S. to rid 
itself of its weapons in Europe is gutting our security system 
and will make the globe more dangerous, not safer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister talks about 50 years ago.  Perhaps he should talk 
about 50 years from now.  Nuclear weapons have been the steadfast 
cornerstone of western security policy since the creation of NATO 
in 1949.  Unless the minister can outline in the House with 
detail all the security risks the globe will encounter in the 
next 50 years, my party cannot support the idea of total nuclear 
disarmament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it is certainly an idealistic view, it is not based on 
reality.  The reality is the Russian parliament will not 
implement START II any time soon. 
To delude ourselves that the Russians are is very dangerous.  The 
reality is the Chinese are developing more nuclear weapons, not 
less.  To delude ourselves that they are not is also very 
dangerous.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I must say I was troubled by the statement of the 
representative of the Conservative Party.  He believes the 
presence of nuclear weapons in some way contributes to a safer 
planet when in fact all the evidence indicates exactly the 
opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though he says he is not prepared to agree to working 
toward total abolition of nuclear weapons, I want to ask him 
whether at the very least he agrees with the suggestion made by 
many countries that there should be steps taken to de-alert the 
nuclear arsenals of all nuclear states, including the elimination 
of the hair trigger nuclear postures and the removal of warheads 
from their delivery systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he at least agree that we should be taking that kind of 
step to reduce the risk of nuclear catastrophe on the planet? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
the question.  Actually I could go a lot further than that and 
say the long term goal is total elimination of nuclear armaments 
of any kind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime—and this is not in the short term—we are still 
stuck with the dangers out there, with the rogue countries that 
will develop nuclear arms.  If they are sitting there with 
nuclear arms we need a deterrent.  As I mentioned, the Americans 
are still looking at their star wars project right now because 
they know they have to protect themselves.  They need an 
alternative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The long term view is that we would be very happy to see them 
completely gone, but in the short term that will not happen so we 
still have to keep them as a deterrent.  Hopefully over a period 
of time we will eliminate them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his very pointed and 
interesting speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very interested in one aspect, though, that perhaps we have 
not touched upon.  It is one of the greatest threats when it 
comes to the potential for a nuclear disaster taking place in the 
future. I am referring to the trafficking of small amounts of 
fissile material, which in my view is one of the most serious 
threats to international security that exists today, particularly 
in view of the fact that the former U.S.S.R. nations including 
Russia are economically impoverished and have a significant 
amount of nuclear material, in the order of up to 30,000 nuclear 
weapons, and the fissile material that goes with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my colleague and his party be interested in working with 
members across the House to develop a common strategy to present 
to the international community to deal with the accounting, 
monitoring and ultimate destruction of fissile nuclear material? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member very 
much for the question.  That is one thing I did not actually 
raise in my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Russians have 30,000 weapons.  With the economic situation 
in Russia that creates the desire for them, instead of scrapping 
weapons, to probably try to sell them off. There will definitely 
be a market.  We would be happy to do anything we could to get 
together with a group to try to find a solution to this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, as I have said, the Russians will not scrap them. 
They will try to sell them.  The people they will be selling them 
to obviously are not the major nuclear forces.  They will be as I 
said before the rogues.  That is where the danger lies. Again, I 
would be very happy to work on any project like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a very brief 
question.  Perhaps the member for Compton—Stanstead did not hear 
my initial question.  I want to repeat it and ask for an answer.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Progressive Conservative Party support the suggestion 
that Canada should be taking a lead in urging the immediate 
de-alerting of the nuclear arsenals of all nuclear states? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price:</B>  Mr. Speaker, to the member for 
Burnaby—Douglas, the very simple answer is yes.  I will leave it 
at that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I followed carefully the speech given by the hon. 
member.  I have a question for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year or the year before when we started working on a land 
mine ban it was obvious for most of us that the U.S., Russia and 
China would not go along with it.  Despite that we went ahead and 
had the treaty signed by over 40 countries.  It is now 
international law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should express in the House if he agrees with 
the principle of banning rather than just the banning of weapons 
now.  If he does not accept that principle, how can we work 
toward it?  How can we put pressure on governments to give up 
nuclear weapons? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few months ago when India and Pakistan exploded weapons the 
international community was very concerned.  Two weeks ago both 
countries expressed that they were prepared to sign on to the 
nuclear test ban treaty.  That is a step forward and we should 
encourage it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only country not to comply or to express concern and sign 
the treaty is Israel.  We have to work together to put pressure 
on all countries to comply with the intent of the ban so we can 
go forward into the next century with hopefully more peace of 
mind for everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question.  I am not clear what exactly he was asking.  It was 
more a statement than a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that if we knew what would happen in the 
next 15 years it would be very easy to sign on and agree solidly 
with something.  We can look very clearly down the road to see 
what is coming in the immediate future.  We see that a threat is 
still there.  It will not go away tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is not the countries that have signed the treaty; it 
is the countries that have not signed the treaty.  An arms sale 
is still going on in the background.  We cannot eliminate ours if 
they are going to be out there.  The threat is still there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We lived through all the years of the cold war.  There were no 
nuclear explosions because one counteracted the other.  We are 
still in that position.  We are not in a cold war situation.  We 
might say it is a bit hotter war right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian:</B>  Mr. Speaker, did the hon. member 
say that if more nations have nuclear weapons the world would be 
a safer place?  If 100 rather than 10 countries had nuclear 
weapons, would the world be a safer place?  Is that the assertion 
the hon. member is putting forward? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member is 
reading between the lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For sure the world is not a safer place because we have more 
nuclear weapons.  We have to reduce nuclear weapons and they will 
be reduced over a period of time.  It will not happen overnight. 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-52.  It is great for 
Canada, Canadians and the world that we are taking a leadership 
role in trying to ratify the test ban treaty signed by 150 
countries in 1950. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the cold war era the nuclear weapons threat loomed very large 
in all our lives.  A threat existed not only between the 
countries of the former Soviet bloc states and Canada.  Other 
nations were beginning to develop nuclear programs.  In the post 
cold war era this threat has changed. Sometimes we may believe 
the threat is less than in the cold war era.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reality the threat today is even greater than what it was 15 
years ago.  The reasons are many.  We will get to them in the 
future but it is for the reason that we have a much greater 
threat today with respect to nuclear weapons that we are in a 
position to ratify this treaty and bring it into law.  This 
brings into force the reasons and the rationale and the purpose 
of the test ban treaty signed in September 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a little disappointed that it took us two years after we 
signed this treaty to the time we came to this House to ratify it 
and to bring it into force.  That is far too long.  It should 
take much less time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also the government should keep in mind that it would be useful 
for parliament to take a look at treaties before these treaties 
are signed.  Constructive ideas exist across party lines to be 
able to contribute to the nature and essence of these treaties to 
make them stronger and more relevant to the Canadian public.  I 
think the government would do well to emulate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This test ban treaty is only the beginning.  As I mentioned, we 
have a much more dangerous situation in the world and the reason 
why we have a much more dangerous situation is that nuclear 
material right now has become far more disbursed, getting into 
the hands of people who should never have it.  In fact, the 
controls that existed in the cold war era are to some extent 
gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely imperative for those controls to be exerted on 
the fissile material across the world.  We do not know the people 
who have it and we do not know where much of this fissile 
material is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following are some constructive suggestions that the 
government would perhaps consider in its international talks with 
respect to nuclear disarmament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe, as my colleague from the Conservative Party 
mentioned, that a comprehensive ban of all nuclear weapons around 
the world is actually going to take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has to approve and go after the START III talks, 
the strategic arms reduction talks. It has to work with other 
countries to pursue those. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should pursue with other countries the banning of 
multiple independent re-entry vehicle techniques which are 
multiple independent nuclear warheads that can be dispersed.  We 
also need to pursue a ban on independent and medium range 
ballistic missiles which could be a significant threat in the 
Middle East and in South Asia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should take a very strong view with working with 
other countries to deal with the trafficking of fissile 
materials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After 1991 and the collapse of the former U.S.S.R. there were 
30,000 nuclear weapons that existed in those countries.  Much of 
that material has gone into Russia but in the collapse of Russia 
that is taking place right now, no one knows where this material 
is or who controls it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has to be for the independent and collective security of 
the countries of the world an accounting system regarding where 
this fissile material is, who has it and to ensure that proper 
controls and safety measures are there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has to be a downsizing of fissile materials. These fissile 
materials have to go into situations where they cannot be used 
for the production of nuclear weapons.  This is exceedingly 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canberra commission of 1996 put together some very important 
documents with respect to that. There has to also be a vigorous 
accounting of these fissile materials which simply does not exist 
right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look around the world and see the primary threat with 
respect to nuclear weapons, it is in the dispersement, the sale 
and the black market of not only fissile materials but the 
triggering mechanisms that would enable somebody to produce a 
nuclear bomb. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not very complex science to produce a nuclear bomb and in 
the wrong hands one could be made.  We need not look any further 
than what Saddam Hussein was saying in Iraq and the intelligence 
that we have recently regarding how close he was to developing a 
nuclear weapons potential that could have seriously threatened 
any kind of peace in the Middle East and caused an environmental 
disaster.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of environmental disasters, one thing we are not taking 
into consideration which is a serious problem is what is taking 
place with nuclear waste.  I understand that Russia has dumped 
nuclear waste over large segments of Siberia.  These fissile 
materials, these nuclear materials, are highly radioactive, 
carcinogenic, teratogenic and toxic.  Some of them have half 
lives of hundreds of years. They get into the biosystem and 
multiply as they go up the food chain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People eat animals at the top of the food chain and they manage 
to acquire large amounts of radioactive materials in their 
systems.  One need not look any further than what is happening 
with aboriginal people in the Arctic to see the high amounts of 
the substances that exist within their biomass.  They have large 
amounts of these carcinogenic and toxic materials in their 
tissues.  Large amounts of this material have come from Siberia 
to the Arctic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for this reason that Canadians and this parliament need to 
be very concerned, aware and interested in what happens to this 
biological material.  It is a serious threat to the health and 
welfare of not only people but flora and fauna. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the 193 countries in September 1996, only 150 countries 
signed this treaty; 43 did not.  We can use our diplomatic 
initiatives, our embassies, our respect around the world and our 
diplomatic ability to convince these 43 non-signatories to come 
on board and sign it.  It will not be possible for some of these 
countries to sign at this moment. But it does not mean we cannot 
try to get these countries to come on board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Potential hot spots that need our acute intervention and acute 
interests involve South Asia between India and Pakistan, and the 
situation in the Middle East with respect to Iraq and Israel.  As 
mentioned, the situation between Russia and the United States 
needs to be dealt with.  One hidden faction in all this which we 
do not take into consideration enough is the situation with 
China.  We like to say the United States is the only super power 
that exists.  In my view that is utterly false. China is a super 
power, has been a super power for some time and has the weapons 
capability of a super power, both conventional and 
non-conventional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I compliment members from across party lines for pursuing the 
rapid support of this bill and also supporting the ban on nuclear 
weapons.  I do not think it will be feasible for us to ban them 
outright but we must do whatever we can to pursue the downloading 
of existing nuclear weapons in the world.  We should do our best 
to remove them and destroy them and to deal with the fissile 
materials that are out there and to put an urgent dampening 
control on those nuclear weapon materials.  This is not only for 
our individual security but for our collective security. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to join in this debate today to talk about the test 
ban treaty and the necessity to have such a treaty in the world. 
I will detail some of the things the government I hope pursues 
with vigour over the next months and years as it tries to make 
this test ban treaty more than just a symbolic measure that is 
easy to agree with and is easy to endorse; a comprehensive 
agreement that will cover not only the ones that have signed to 
date but the problem states, the rogue states, that as of now 
have refused to do it for a variety of reasons.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read into the record again what this bill does.  It does 
implement the test ban treaty that Canada has been in favour of 
and has endorsed for some time since its inception.  It is an 
attempt to ban the testing of nuclear weapons by limiting nuclear 
explosions.  It spells out severe penalties for Canadians and 
others if they are involved in the detonation of a nuclear device 
in Canada.  It makes it a crime to aid and abet such an action. 
It obliges Canadian companies to report any chemical blasts that 
could be mistaken for nuclear explosions, in other words large 
scale chemical explosions, in order to monitor the whole process 
of who is testing what and where. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the official opposition we generally support this piece of 
legislation.  I would like to bring up a few problems or 
reservations I have on not so much the legislation but the 
process we have followed so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there is in this legislation and in the test ban treaty a 
mechanism to monitor worldwide any explosions that may be taking 
place, the magnitude, what was involved, who did it and when and 
so on.  That is a good thing. Canada is certainly doing its part. 
We have a series of seismic and other tests that will ensure 
that this monitoring continues and we will do our part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As in all international agreements, I urge the government to 
make sure this does not become an excuse for a large scale 
bureaucracy.  I hope it will not but there is always the danger 
that when there is a multinational organization and an agreement 
is in place no one watches the bottom line.  Certainly there is 
no bottom line on peace but there is a bottom line on how much 
this testing should cost and I urge the government just to keep 
an eye on that.  I hope it will and certainly we will be doing 
that from our side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it has been brought up today in the speeches, but I want 
to reiterate that we want to make sure there are no illusions on 
the part of people watching this debate or by the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs that this is the be all and end all that will 
somehow bring us the nirvana of perpetual peace on earth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is really a small step in securing the idea that nuclear 
weapons are not desirable and that we should work toward their 
elimination.  That of course is easy to agree with.  Again, it is 
not nirvana, it is not the answer to all this especially given 
the states the hon. member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca has 
already listed.  Look at states like North Korea, India, 
Pakistan, Libya, Syria, some Middle East countries and so on that 
are unwilling at this stage to sign the document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are reasons they have I suppose or they try to justify for 
not signing but whatever the reason they are the very states that 
I think need to be brought into this process.  To engage these 
non-signatories should be the primary goal on the nuclear issue 
by the foreign affairs minister at this stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever pressure or influence Canada can bring over the next 
while, months and years to come, that should be part of all their 
discussions with these countries particularly.  It is not enough 
to sit back, put the flowers in the end of the rifle barrel and 
say all we are saying is give peace a chance.  That is not good 
enough.  We need to make sure this test ban treaty is just a 
start of a vigorous and ongoing campaign to make all countries of 
the world realize that it is in their best interests to pursue 
this non-proliferation treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hard reality is that unruly, unreliable regimes run by 
unruly and unreliable leaders, and I will pick Saddam Hussein as 
an example here, show the necessity of future pressure to make 
these kinds of countries and individuals sign this treaty and to 
verify that they are following through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to pursue those two things.  I do not think anybody 
thinks Canada is going to whip up atomic bombs and start packing 
them around in a suitcase. 
But there is a serious problem with some of these countries.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to use our connections, not only with countries that we 
are not so friendly with, but even with countries that we have 
longstanding traditional relationships with.  In particular, we 
need to look at India and Pakistan.  We have a lot of close ties 
with those countries.  Many people from those countries have 
immigrated to Canada and are now a part of our Canadian culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pakistan and India are in serious difficulties.  They should 
know that we are willing to talk to them and recognize them as 
perhaps not a big superpower like the Americans or the Chinese, 
but certainly a very powerful entity in themselves.  We must tell 
them that we respect their sovereignty.  We must encourage them 
to get on board and do what is best, not just for their own 
country but for the world, by signing this treaty.  Particularly 
with Pakistan and India we must emphasize that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to emphasize that it is important to me and to the Reform 
Party that mechanisms be found to encourage the government to 
bring treaties like this more often to the House of Commons for 
debate.  It is interesting that the committee on foreign affairs 
has been studying the nuclear issue for some months now and just 
as it is drafting its report, which will deal with issues like 
this, the government brings in legislation which says “This is 
the way we are going to do it”.  To tell the members of 
parliament in the foreign affairs committee “I am interested in 
seeing your report, but it does not really matter, we are going 
to proceed as follows” is discouraging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A better process for international treaties would be to bring 
the concept either to a committee or to a debate in the House. 
That would allow members of parliament to at least be a part of 
the process and to be apprised of where we are.  It would allow 
opposition members to have some input on errors and omissions in 
the treaty before the government actually signed on the dotted 
line.  We should have that debate and discussion among members of 
parliament so they feel they have been involved on behalf of the 
people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government listens carefully to many non-government 
organizations, to pressure groups, to other countries and to a 
lot of good debate.  I do not deny that it is all worthwhile. But 
it seems like the last people in the loop are members of 
parliament.  If the government is interested in encouraging 
knowledge and debate on international relations between Canada 
and other countries it has to give the House an important role to 
play in the treaty making process.  Because it does not do that 
it dooms the process to cynicism.  That is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a good debate today on a good bill.  Unfortunately the 
cart is far ahead of the horse and that is too bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the position of the official opposition to support this 
nuclear non-proliferation treaty.  We accept the spirit of Bill 
C-52.  As I have said, I hope that the government in the future 
will use the opportunity not just to educate MPs, but to actually 
let us feel that we have had an impact on the government's 
decision making process.  If the government would do that it 
would probably find lots of support for its position.  MPs would 
feel that they had been brought in at the start of the process 
instead of at the very end. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague from Fraser Valley for once 
again giving an eloquent speech on foreign affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He illustrated the central problem that we have in parliament, 
wherein parliament is often undemocratized.  He articulated the 
problem by illustrating the example of what has gone on in the 
foreign affairs committee, an otherwise very good committee made 
up of good members.  The committee has been diligently working on 
the nuclear issue. 
It is going to present its findings on this after the bill has 
been presented to the House of Commons.  This shows once again 
that ministers and the cabal of individuals on top have an utter 
disregard for members of this House, and in doing so they show an 
utter disregard for the people they represent; namely, the 
Canadian people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be far better for this House to work to ensure that 
members from across party lines are able to work and represent 
their constituents effectively by bringing their good ideas to 
committee in a timely and reasonable fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the member deals with leadership.  He 
illustrated the problem of the lack of accountability on fissile 
materials around the world.  Would my hon. colleague support an 
international meeting to deal with the disclosure of information 
on fissionable materials?  Countries from around the world could 
come to one place to discuss and debate, to put forth a process 
whereby all countries would disclose what fissionable materials 
they have and the condition of those fissionable materials.  Then 
a system of accounting could be put in place so we would all know 
where this weapons grade nuclear material is located. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for both his comment and his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His comment is well taken.  Because of the importance of the 
bill, in my own way I was smacking the government's hand a 
little.  However, he spelled out pretty clearly and bluntly that 
the government faces the danger of making committee work just 
busy work.  That is, as soon as we start to get into the nitty-gritty 
our work is either trumped by the government or discarded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen some moves in committees over the last week or so 
where chairmen who have confronted and challenged the government 
have been moved aside.  It is very unfortunate and very 
de-motivating for people who come here thinking that their 
opinion is going to count to find out that instead they should 
just take a number and wait to be told what to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and again this has happened with our peacekeeping efforts. 
We often read about a situation in the papers on the weekend. 
Then we come here on Monday and hear the minister ask parliament 
to endorse the position he has already taken, which is to send 
troops overseas, into harm's way.  Those of us on this side of 
the House, and I think many on the government side too, might 
have liked to have a debate before the minister signed on the 
dotted line.  I might have liked to have expressed my views.  I 
would have listened to the arguments.  We should have true 
debates instead of set speeches that basically spell out what is 
going to be done anyway and tough toenails. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would democratize foreign policy especially.  Foreign 
policy deals not just with Canadians, but with our international 
relations.  We have a right to enter that debate and we have an 
obligation to our constituents to show that we have an interest. 
Those members of parliament who say they are only interested in 
what happens in their own constituencies could be shown for the 
parochial bunch they are.  Let us flush them out.  Let us make 
them treat foreign affairs with the importance it should have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second issue concerns whether there should be an 
international protocol of some sort to track fissionable 
material.  The member pointed out a very huge problem.  We have 
spent hundreds of millions of dollars in Canada alone trying to 
figure out what to do with our own nuclear waste and we still do 
not know what we are supposed to do with it.  We still do not 
have a plan.  We still keep it in the swimming pool and hope that 
nobody dives in the deep end.  Even in Canada, which has some of 
the highest standards, we do not have a protocol.  We can 
certainly track it, but we do not know what to do with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take that and expand it to other countries in the world that do 
not have the resources to even handle it properly.  We need a 
method to track it and to help those countries that cannot deal 
with it to deal with it in some way that best mitigates the 
problem.  I certainly support that initiative.

to make. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obviously an important policy that we are discussing today 
which has a very fine historical record.  We are debating today 
what was initiated by Mr. Pearson, even before he became the 
Prime Minister of Canada, and that policy was continued by 
successive prime ministers, particularly Prime Minister Trudeau, 
in order to establish the fact that Canada was one of the few 
nations in the world which voluntarily renounced the use of 
nuclear power for military purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, there is a tradition of which all 
parliamentarians can be proud because we have been in the 
forefront of this policy making process and we continue to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been established in so many ways and in so many debates, 
in widespread forums and throughout public opinion, that no 
nuclear nation has the right nor the justification to use nuclear 
weapons.  The pictures of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are very clear 
in the memories not only of those who lived through that 
experience, but also of subsequent generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is definitely a will to ensure—and I suppose this is at 
the root of this treaty—that any measure of that kind will never 
be adopted again and cause such terrible agony and atrocities on 
human beings, no matter who is involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In connection with this treaty, it must also be said that 
whenever major nations have conducted nuclear tests they have 
turned out to be public relations disasters.  I can only refresh 
everyone's memory to the last test conducted by France in the 
Pacific which clearly provoked and generated a very intensive 
counter-complaint on the part of public opinion, not only in 
Europe but in every continent, aimed at dissuading the Government 
of France of the day from conducting such a test.  The same can 
be said of China, a country that is still conducting tests and 
which should be discouraged from doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public opinion certainly does not look kindly on conducting 
tests of a nuclear nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever attempts are made by nations to justify the use of 
nuclear weapons, their rationale has the weight of zero.  There 
is no rationale and no justification in the light of the 
evolution of the human culture and of mankind to justify the 
utilization of nuclear weapons any longer.  I am sure it is the 
intent of this treaty and the hope of the totality of public 
opinion the world over to consider that any form of nuclear 
weapon use has come to a conclusion and that there will never 
again be any attempt to use them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that sense, we are glad to have the opportunity in this 
parliament to endorse Canada's signing and ratifying of this 
treaty because it gives us an opportunity to express these 
sentiments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next point that one would inevitably like to make is to call 
on the non-signatories—and there are 43 of those nations—and 
urge them to do so.  From Afghanistan to Zimbabwe there are some 
minor and middle powers that have not yet seen fit to do so.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of these nations are represented here in Ottawa by 
embassies or high commissions. Their representatives ought to be 
called upon by the Government of Canada and urged to do their 
duty to sign this nuclear test ban treaty without delay. Make the 
pressure of public opinion felt by them in their desire to be 
civilized members of the world community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next point has to do with the issue of nuclear liability. 
Our country is due to revisit this issue and to debate the 
nuclear liability limits we have.  We have to determine new 
thresholds and establish a new approach.  This is an overdue 
piece of legislation which requires parliamentary attention in 
the interests of the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next point has to do with the question of Canadian industry 
notification which is outlined in a briefing note I have here. 
The legislation we intend to pass will request Canadian industry 
to report large chemical explosions which could be confused with 
nuclear explosions.  There is a qualifier in this request, namely 
if possible, prior notification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that prior notification if possible be deleted 
and notification be made mandatory because if there is good will, 
there is a way of getting notification without any qualifier to 
that particular process.  It is a good measure and I am sure 
Canadian industry will want to collaborate. I am referring to 
those instances when 300 tonnes or more of TNT equivalent 
material will be used.  This idea of prior notification is highly 
desirable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of nuclear waste has been raised and we are all 
painfully aware of the issue.  It is one that has been posing a 
major problem not only to Canada but also to the United States 
and other jurisdictions where the disposition of nuclear waste is 
still an unresolved issue. In other words we do not know where to 
safely put the waste that is generated through nuclear material 
utilization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This very important environmental issue also has economic 
implications.  This issue has to be examined whenever we intend 
to amplify the future use of nuclear power for non-military 
purposes because the question of waste management and waste 
disposal has not yet been resolved.  It is one that is being 
tackled at least in low level radiation waste material in 
southern Ontario by an initiative of the current Minister of the 
Environment for which we congratulate her.  This needs to be 
expanded of course to other material as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank the member for his speech and for 
his longstanding personal commitment in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member a specific question with respect 
to the upcoming vote before the United Nations General Assembly 
on a resolution which will be proposing multilateral negotiations 
leading to an early conclusion of a nuclear weapons convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will recall that South African President Nelson 
Mandela in his very eloquent speech before the general assembly 
last month urged that all nations, including Canada, join with 
the new agenda coalition in supporting this resolution.  Last 
year Canada voted against this resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the member whether he does not agree that it is 
important that Canada send out a strong signal of its support for 
the new agenda coalition by voting for and indeed by 
co-sponsoring this important resolution at this session of the 
United Nations General Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia:</B>  Mr. Speaker, whether Canada would 
co-sponsor this resolution is a moot question and probably it is 
too late for that.  I imagine that the resolution has travelled 
sufficiently ahead to not require Canada's involvement.  However, 
it is certainly a measure which I am sure the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs looks at favourably and that we should be moving on. 
Maybe there is a certain hesitance for reasons I do not know, but 
in principle it seems to me to be a very desirable initiative and 
worthy of support. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I first of all wish to commend the member for Davenport 
for his eloquent speech.  I also commend him for the hard work he 
has done as chair of the environment committee and his long 
commitment to the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is a historical one.  In the last parliament the 
Liberal government changed the environmental laws to allow China 
to purchase nuclear reactors.  Canada gave China $1.5 billion in 
loans to do that.  Just recently we have made some agreements 
with Turkey.  It is quite obvious that the Government of Canada 
historically and today has a very poor track record when it comes 
to nuclear conversations of any kind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member for Davenport agree with the government's 
decision to circumvent or change environment laws in order to 
pursue its nuclear policies? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows 
very well my views on this subject and I do not see the necessity 
of repeating them in this chamber. 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have a question for the hon. member for Davenport, but while on 
my feet I would like to reply to the question of the member for 
Burnaby—Douglas on de-alerting.  I probably represented my 
party's views rather authoritatively since we are still 
considering this component. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the member for Davenport is if we could list in 
detail what will face us within the next 50 years, what would his 
reaction be to total disarmament rather than just arms control, 
which is what we are really doing now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that the 
hon. member is asking a hypothetical question. Therefore it is 
one which we have to treat as such. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the ideal of total disarmament is one we all would 
want to strive for.  But we also know that this is not a reality 
in the context of present day relations and conflicts in many 
areas around the globe.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would imagine that 50 years from now we will be talking of 
security more in environmental terms than in military terms.  I 
would imagine that in 50 years the concept of security will be 
quite different from the one of today.  I would imagine that the 
emphasis on arms will decline and perhaps there will be much more 
emphasis on access to drinking water for instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would imagine that with the doubling of the global population 
from the present five billion possibly to ten billion, the 
pressure on worldwide natural resources, and by that I mean 
fisheries, forestry, water and the like, will be enormous.  We 
will have a completely different security agenda from what we 
have today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until then, I think we have to be realistic and know also that 
we have a role to play in peacekeeping as it is shaping up in the 
Balkans and in other parts of the world.  For some time to come, 
arms will be needed sometimes in order to make peace. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I too would like to ask the member for Davenport a 
question.  I would first preface my remarks like a great many 
others with a tribute to the work he has done over the years on 
the environment, although I must say I have found him to be a bit 
ambiguous on the nuclear question from time to time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the goal he just mentioned, the complete 
abolition of nuclear weapons, or total disarmament as he referred 
to it, does he not think the time has come for Canada as a member 
of NATO to show leadership in that body?  That is where we find a 
great many members of the existing nuclear club, but not all of 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he not think there is a role there for Canada to say to 
those in the nuclear club that they can no longer expect to 
maintain their monopoly as it were on nuclear weapons and at the 
same time ask the rest of the world to desist from the production 
and deployment of nuclear weapons?  Is there a role here for NATO 
and the nuclear club in showing some leadership and is Canada 
uniquely positioned to show leadership in that way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia:</B>  Mr. Speaker, regarding the question 
of being ambiguous, the advantage of being a Liberal over being 
an NDPer is that instead of looking at the world in black and 
white, we can also detect a number of shades of grey. Therefore 
sometimes our message is more complex and less simplistic than 
the message from the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the reason we convince more Canadians to elect us to 
conduct the business of government than the NDP has so far. 
There is something about ambiguity that can be attributed to the 
capacity of seeing more shades of colours than just black and 
white. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the second point, NATO, this is a subject of continuous 
discussion and debate.  I do not feel qualified enough to give an 
adequate reply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I note that there are still a 
couple of minutes left in the questions and comments.  As we are 
approaching 2 p.m., I wonder if I might let that go until after 
question period and we will go to Statements by Members now.

Pearson airport and $3.4 million wasted on Airbus.  And just this 
summer $20 million was wasted on compensating Ethyl Corporation 
for banning MMT without just cause or sound evidence.

emphasize the importance to individuals and institutions of 
having a fire escape plan for the home and the workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too many of us do not have any such plan in place, or if we have 
we have not actually practised it to see if it works.  It remains 
a sad fact of life that each year hundreds of Canadians die

could be prevented by taking precautionary measures such as 
developing fire escape routes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all Canadians to take the message of Fire Prevention Week 
to heart.  A good start would be to participate in the activities 
that will be held in communities all across Canada and to know 
and to practise fire drills at home and at work.  The lives they 
save may be their own.

last week six Reform MPs and I visited the central coast of B.C.

department of that university, but especially as a proud French 
Canadian who was deeply involved and well respected in his 
community.

that interfered with the work of the commission.  I am satisfied 
with the word of the minister and the word of the lawyer— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Colleagues, surely we should let the person 
answer the question.  Like many of you, I am having difficulty

that we want this commission to do its work as quickly as 
possible so that we will know all the facts.  That is what this

country will be happy if we let them do their work.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday at 3.30 the Solicitor General was out in 
the lobby denying he ever said what he said.  By 5.30 last night 
there is a letter in Ottawa saying he did— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  No props. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is a letter that 
was discussed this morning by the minister.  On September 21 the 
minister rose in this House saying that it would be completely 
inappropriate to discuss any details around this investigation. 
The minister obviously discussed this with a friend on the 
airplane, which he did not remember last night but did a couple 
of hours later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is to the Prime Minister.  The minister did discuss 
it.  He said in this House he should not.  Should he not resign 
until this commission is over? 
<P><A NAME="LINK107"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

<P><A NAME="LINK108"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, clearly the 
Solicitor General would not have remained in his position had a 
friend of the Liberal Party not qualified his remarks in the 
plane. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Prime Minister.  Is a lawyer like Mr. 
Toole, whose firm contributed $10,000 to the victory of the 
Liberal Party in the last election, capable of qualifying the 
remarks he heard to save the skin of the Solicitor General? 
<P><A NAME="LINK109"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the lawyer in question, a prominent citizen of New Brunswick, 
sent a letter, which is now a public document.  If the hon. 
member is saying that the lawyer is lying, let him say so 
outside the House of Commons, and the lawyer can take the 
appropriate action.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the fact is 
that this is where the event is occurring and it is here we want 
to know whether the Solicitor General should remain in his 
position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is as follows: As the Solicitor General, the 
minister for public security in a way, is supposed to be above 
all suspicion, can he say that he remains so in order to keep 
his position?  We do not think so.

would not compromise it and I did not compromise it.  That is 
what I said yesterday.  That is what I said today.  That is what 
has been substantiated by the person who sat with me on the

is incredible.  First the minister cannot remember who he spoke 
to, what their gender was, what the person said, and then, like 
in a soap opera, the 24-hour amnesia passes and all of a sudden 
he discovers that the mystery passenger was his good friend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not even pass the laugh test.  Why does the minister

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

I never remembered on Monday who was on the plane the Thursday 
night before.  I have taken this plane 300 times in the last five 
years with many of the same people.  It is a small community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found out last night who it was.  I had the conversation

General.  In case he does not remember, he is in the House of

that plane.  Why does he not quit fooling around, quit with the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B>  Mr.

interested in protecting the integrity of this inquiry, it is he. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that he has reflected badly on the inquiry, why does he not

inquiry that four to five Mounties overreacted for five minutes. 
No one knows this.  I think it was excessive”, will the

APEC and is the equivalent of President Clinton's famous line “I

Minister of Human Resources Development said the following about 
the millions of young people who pay into EI and are not 
entitled to draw benefits: “The ones without employment 
insurance coverage were perhaps people who ought not to have 
been covered from the start”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this what the Minister of Human Resources Development's youth 
employment strategy is all about, telling young people they are 
not entitled to receive benefits but are required, on the other 
hand, to make contributions starting with the very first hour 
they work? That is my question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK153"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what I have been trying to get 
across to the Bloc Quebecois from the word go is that one is 
doing young people a disservice if one makes the employment 
insurance system readily accessible to them.  If it is too easy 
to get employment insurance, this is an invitation to drop out 
of school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What our government wants to do is to encourage young people to 
stay in school.  When they want to make the transition to the 
work force, we have a youth employment strategy to help them to 
do so.  That is what we want, not youth unemployment.

<P><A NAME="LINK167"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Claudette Bradshaw (Moncton—Riverview—Dieppe, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it looks like a very long time to me now, 
but in June this summer I began my career with the Boys and Girls 
Club.  Len Jones at the time was the mayor of Moncton.  I have 
known Mr. Jones for a long time.  He was a member of the board of 
directors of the East End Boys' Club when I was working for the 
Moncton Boys and Girls Club. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After working in the Boys and Girls Club for six years I started 
the head start program.  In those days a lot of politicians said 
to me that I would not get the support of the community for the 
children because they were two to five years of age.  They were 
too young.  They were not breaking windows and the community 
would not support me if I started such a program.  I went to 
different agencies and they said the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, two politicians said to me “Claudette, go for it”. 
Len Jones was one of them.  When we started we were in a small 
house.  We did not have any money.  Never did I do anything with 
the head start program without Len Jones being there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing that shows who Len Jones was was when his daughter 
Helen went out west.  As a community we were shocked that Len 
Jones would leave the city of Moncton.  We said that he would 
never leave because he had given his life to the city as mayor 
and as a member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember my discussion with him.  He said “You know, 
Claudette, I am a family man.  I have always believed in what you 
have done for children.   My daughter is going out west and she 
would like us to move with her”. 
He and his wife moved out west to be with their daughter.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Len Jones was there for children.  He also believed that every 
child in the school system should learn to speak French from 
grade 1 up to grade 12.  He advocated that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was always there for me with the head start program.  He 
always believed in prevention.  I would like to say to his family 
that being in the House of Commons I often think of Len Jones. He 
had hard battles to win sometimes.  Running as an independent was 
not easy for him, but he stood for what he believed in.  If I 
were to say one thing about Len Jones, it is that he was a man of 
character. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the House for the chance to speak about Mr. Jones.  Like 
I said, he was always there for children in the Moncton area.

on behalf of the Reform Party of Canada and Her Majesty's 
Official Opposition I rise to pay tribute to Mr. Leonard Jones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Jones, a World War II veteran, lawyer and former mayor of 
Moncton, served as Canada's first elected independent member of 
parliament from 1974 to 1979.  He will always be remembered as a 
man who stood by his convictions and who never shied away from 
confrontation.  He was another Canadian who bravely battled 
cancer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have learned that his great passions were law and politics. He 
was a formidable opponent in the courtroom.  Mr. Jones was 
Moncton's longest serving mayor.  He was first elected as a 
councillor in 1957 and only lost one election in his political 
career that spanned more than two decades.  Mr. Jones supported 
Moncton's head start program for children.  He is survived by his 
wife and long time law partner, his daughter and his sister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of all Reform Party members of parliament I extend Mr. 
Jones' family our very sincere condolences.  Mr. Jones will be 
missed by all who had the privilege of knowing him. 
<P><A NAME="LINK169"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
on behalf of my colleagues I too would like to rise in my place 
to honour the memory of Mr. Leonard Jones who served in the 
Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Leonard Jones was known to those of us who did not know him 
personally as a somewhat controversial figure.  The member who 
first spoke showed us a little something about politics that 
Canadians often miss:  often members of parliament or other 
public persons who come to be associated with particular 
controversies suffer from having their full humanity hidden in 
the caricature that sometimes comes from the controversies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It moved me to hear that Mr. Jones was involved in the Boys and 
Girls Club and that he had a reputation for being very concerned 
about the young people of Moncton.  That just goes to show us 
that we ought not to allow our memories and our perceptions of 
people to be clouded by particular controversies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I join with others in honouring the work that Mr. Jones did in 
Moncton, his service to his country in time of war, his 
commitment to his principles, and his long service in many 
respects to Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK170"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I note 
the words of the member for Moncton.   As the House marks the 
passing of Leonard Jones, we in the Progressive Conservative 
caucus send our condolences to the Jones family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is perhaps appropriate to note that political differences are 
left behind when one faces the ultimate mysteries of mortality. 
In this place, which has seen radical differences and dramatic 
reconciliation over the years, we mark the passing of one who 
fought for what he believed.

</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today I rise in the House to pay tribute 
to a former member who died recently at the age of 82. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Donald Munro was a very distinguished Canadian who served 
his country both in the diplomatic service and in the House.  I 
knew Don well as he was the candidate who was successful in the 
election which followed my resignation from my seat in 
Esquimalt—Saanich back in 1972 when I took on the leadership of 
the provincial Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Born in Regina, Don was always a very proud westerner.  He moved 
to Vancouver to finish his education and became a teacher before 
he was granted a scholarship to the Sorbonne in Paris by the 
French government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was common for young men of the day, he quickly signed up 
with the armed forces at the outbreak of war, joining the Royal 
Canadian Air Force in 1940 and serving as a navigator and later 
as an instructor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the war he finished his education by completing his 
masters in political science at the University of Toronto before 
joining the external affairs department in 1946. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His postings included Paris, Ankara, Dublin, Brussels and 
Beirut.  His postings were as numerous as his interests.  He 
served as head of the Canadian delegation in Vientiane, Laos. 
Following a year with the National Defence College in Kingston, 
Don was named ambassador to Costa Rica in 1967.  He was 
responsible for the neighbouring countries of Nicaragua, 
Honduras, El Salvador and Panama.  He served with 
distinguishment, retiring from diplomatic service in 1972. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never one to sidestep a challenge, Don sought and won the 
Progressive Conservative candidacy in the Esquimalt—Saanich 
riding and won in the election of 1972 by a wide margin.  The 
voters of that constituency obviously thought highly of him and 
regarded him as an effective representative because he was 
elected three more times in 1974, 1979 and 1980 before retiring 
from politics in 1984. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Don Munro was an outstanding Canadian who always acted as a 
great spokesman for the people he represented.  We extend our 
condolences to his wife Lynn and his two stepchildren.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
in rising to mark the passing of Donald Munro I first want to 
express the sympathy of the members of the Progressive 
Conservative caucus to Mrs. Munro and her family on their loss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Donald was elected to represent the Vancouver Island 
constituency of Esquimalt—Saanich as a Progressive Conservative 
MP in the general election of 1972 and was successfully 
re-elected until his retirement in 1984. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His service to the people of Canada in the House of Commons was 
but another chapter in the life of public service.  During World 
War II he served as an officer in the Royal Canadian Air Force. 
Following the war he joined the Department of External Affairs 
and served Canada in a number of diplomatic posts, including Laos 
and a number of countries in Central America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that was but a prelude to his membership in the House of 
Commons where he applied his lifetime of professional experience 
and put forward his views with skill and candour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In commemorating the passing of Donald Munro, we recognize not 
only one who shared with us the elections of the House but a man 
who gave his entire adult life to the service of his country and 
his fellow Canadians.  He was an example to remember, and I thank 
the House for the opportunity to commend him.

summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Munro was elected in 1972 under the Tory banner and 
re-elected in 1974, 1979 and 1980.  Born in Regina, he went to

he, being a man of with a strong sense of duty and conviction, 
decided to enrol in the RCAF and finished the war as a flight 
lieutenant.

was made ambassador to Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, El

Dalhousie University.  Don Munro, a man with a strong sense of 
conviction and duty, served his country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He then went to parliament to do the right thing and on numerous 
occasions took up positions that were perhaps politically 
incorrect at the time but were positions which he felt his 
constituents supported.  A man of courage and principles, Don 
Munro fought for the people, he fought to do the right thing and 
he fought to make sure the people of the west were represented 
well here in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I first met Don in 1991 after making some speeches on foreign 
affairs in Victoria.  Although he was retired at the time, he 
asked some pointed and constructive questions on international 
relations.  He was still very much involved and very interested 
in the larger world around him, as well as his community. 
Throughout his career Mr. Munro fought hard for those 
constituents and he fought for Canada.  Testimony to this is the 
fact that he was re-elected three times to the riding of 
Esquimalt—Saanich. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Munro leaves his wife Lynn and their two stepchildren, the 
people of Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca and Saanich.  All the people of 
Victoria owe a huge debt of gratitude to Donald Munro and his 
family for the many years of service he gave not only to the 
people of British Columbia but also to Canadians at large.  The 
likes of him do not come this way very often.  On behalf of the

Furthermore, in recent weeks, two new international instruments 
have reached the point of ratification needed for their 
implementation and have joined the panoply of agreements that 
are bringing us closer to a sustainable peace.  I refer to the 
anti-personnel mines treaty we have already mentioned and the 
treaty banning the use of anti-aircraft weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once this new treaty is ratified, we must continue to work for 
disarmament by ensuring progress in three other areas: the ban 
on the production of fissionable material for nuclear arms, the 
non-military use of atomic energy and the non-proliferation of 
light weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks ago, Canada's permanent ambassador to the UN for 
disarmament was appointed chair of the committee negotiating an 
international agreement on the production of fissionable 
material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within the context of the conference on disarmament, 60 
countries are prepared to begin discussions.  As we know, the 
conference on disarmament is where the chemical weapons 
convention and the comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty, which 
we are discussing today, were negotiated.  If the conference 
manages to ban fissionable materials for nuclear weapons, we 
will have taken another step toward nuclear disarmament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to raise a problem frequently raised in this House, 
which an agreement on the banning of fissionable materials for 
nuclear weapons would never resolve.  It is the use by the 
military of technology developed for civilian purposes. 
Canada's behaviour is not entirely blameless in this matter, and 
while it denies it, our hands are not totally clean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although Canada never intended to become involved in nuclear 
proliferation, its atomic energy program has unfortunately been 
used to create bombs. 
According to information from the Canadian Nuclear Association, 
India apparently has enough plutonium to build 455 atomic bombs, 
if all the plutonium available to it is added up, whether it 
comes from Canadian reactors or was acquired specifically to 
build bombs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that 8 of the 10 Indian nuclear reactors are Candu 
reactors, we should take a look at our role as exporter of 
nuclear technology.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only nuclear reactor in Pakistan is a Candu and, according 
to some new data, Pakistan may have the capacity to manufacture 
100 nuclear bombs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is the case, should Canada not take action and look 
further into this to prevent our nuclear energy program from 
being used for military purposes? I shall not get into the whole 
issue of transporting and stocking radioactive waste here in 
Canada, which is another problem Canada will have to address 
very soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the signatories will also have to put an end to the 
conventional arms race, which makes for a growing trade in 
developing countries, at the expense of economic, social and 
cultural development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us bear in mind that, in the 1980s, export of light and 
heavy weaponry to the third world represented 70% of the 
industrialized nations' total foreign trade. The international 
community clearly has a responsibility toward the have not 
nations that have grown poorer so that industrialized nations 
and arms lobbies could get even richer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1990s, in spite of a substantial drop in the export of 
heavy weaponry to developing countries, light weapons have been 
proliferating at an alarming rate. One analysis shows the 
following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1980 to 1995, 10 African states with a total population of 
150 million were torn by civil war. The death toll was between 
3.8 and 6.9 million, almost all victims of light weapons—Western 
leaders are apparently more concerned by arms stockpiling in 
third-world hot spots, where they are asked to send peacekeeping 
forces. On the one hand, rich countries try to put an end to 
conflicts while, on the other hand, they continue to supply 
weapons to the belligerents. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time has come for this contradiction to stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, however, action is required and there are solutions.  The 
ratification of the land mines treaty is one example that gives 
us hope that a multilateral small arms agreement will be signed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This summer, one of the concerns the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
voiced about the security of humankind had to do with the small 
arms threat. I urge the minister not just to work with NGOs, but 
to put pressure on the countries that import and export small 
arms in order to prevent their proliferation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Humanity wants to be solidly on the road to peace.  It is with 
conviction and great hope that I support Bill C-52, an act to 
implement the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canada becomes a member of the UN Security Council this week, 
the Bloc Quebecois hopes it will keep its guard up. 
It would be unfortunate if Canada were to be content to point to 
its track record as a defender of peace and human rights. 
Furthermore, current events provide us with frequent examples of 
the dangers of resting on one's laurels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this year marking the 50th anniversary of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, much attention has been given to 
the role of a Canadian, John. P. Humphrey, in writing it.  But a 
recent article by jurist William Schabas reminds us that Canada 
very nearly abstained from voting in favour of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights on December 10, 1948.  Canada's good 
reputation must be earned anew every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada must actively demonstrate its commitment to peace and 
human rights. 
The Bloc Quebecois sees the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty 
as another step on the road to the security of humanity and 
lasting world peace.  But it is not the last, as we have seen.

means and tribunals at its disposal in order to banish nuclear 
weapons from the face of the earth, before life itself is 
extinguished on this planet, accidentally or otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here, as in many other areas, Canada must never stop 
demonstrating its courage, will and conviction if it is to 
continue to live up to its reputation.  Canadians and Quebeckers 
expect nothing less.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to rise in the House today to support Bill C-52, an 
act to implement the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate on this bill and the fact that Canada is supporting 
the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty is a very positive step 
we are taking as a nation.  I have to say as someone who has been 
involved in the peace movement for a long time like many other 
citizens in Canada, any small step we take toward disarmament and 
nuclear disarmament is a sign of hope and optimism for the future 
of our world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the reality is that we still face a very desperate 
situation.  We now have eight nations in the world and maybe more 
which contain nuclear weapons and nuclear capability. We know 
these nations:  Russia, the United States, France, China, the 
United Kingdom, Israel, India and Pakistan.  Even today after the 
cold war and unfortunately when many people think that the threat 
of nuclear weapons has been abolished, we still have in existence 
on our planet 34,000 nuclear weapons.  The threat is something 
which is still very present and very grave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These unquestionably are weapons of mass destruction.  They are 
weapons of mass destruction not only in terms of our environment. 
We know the destruction caused by a nuclear accident on a 
Trident submarine or any other accident would be catastrophic to 
our environment.  More than that, we also know that these weapons 
pose the greatest danger to civilian populations and to our 
planet as a whole.  We have to be aware of and realize that this 
danger is still very present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that the cost of maintaining this vast military 
industrial complex that has produced these weapons of mass 
destruction is something that is literally eating away the 
earth's resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just came back from a mission to Southeast Asia with the 
Canadian Council for International Co-operation.  I witnessed 
firsthand the devastation of the impact of the economic crisis in 
Indonesia and Thailand.  I could not help but think that on this 
planet Earth we have the resources, we have the capability, we 
have the strength if we have the political will to ensure that 
there is not unemployment, that there is not hunger and that 
there are not children on the streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Indonesia 100 million people are living below the poverty 
line.  If we had our priorities straight and if they were aimed 
and directed toward funding and meeting human needs instead of 
the stockpiling, storage and activation of nuclear weapons, then 
children would not be dying, children would not be desperate and 
going without education and health care. Families would have 
adequate housing and people would have jobs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that although this is a very good step and the 
nuclear test ban treaty is a very positive sign, unfortunately 
progress has been very slow. In 1968 the non-proliferation treaty 
was signed but the reality is that we have just gone through the 
last year where we have seen India and Pakistan conduct nuclear 
tests.  There was outrage and condemnation around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article VI of the 1968 non-proliferation treaty states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each of the parties to the treaty undertakes to pursue 
negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to 
cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to 
nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete 
disarmament under strict and effective international control. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The nuclear weapon states have not lived up to their end of the 
bargain.  This aspect of the treaty which passed in 1968 has not 
come to fruition.  The United States and other countries have not 
shown the leadership which is necessary to ensure that article VI 
is actually implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things we want today in this House is that we want 
the Canadian government to show leadership instead of just 
adopting its me too status, as we have seen so often. We want the 
Canadian government to speak out at the United Nations and other 
international forums and call on nuclear weapon states to abide 
by and to fulfil article VI of the non-proliferation treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that happens, the dynamic in the international situation 
would change.  Nations such as India and Pakistan would have some 
faith and respect that the nuclear weapon states are actually 
committed to taking real steps toward nuclear disarmament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the issues that needs to be debated today is not just the 
passage of this bill and the fact that all members of the House 
are supporting this bill but we must also look at what else 
Canada could do to ensure that there is a general and complete 
nuclear disarmament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately Canada still provides airspace and low level 
flight ranges for nuclear bomber training. Unfortunately we still 
host nuclear powered and potentially nuclear armed submarines in 
Canadian waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, as it is the subject of many debates in this House, 
we know politically and diplomatically that Canada has 
consistently supported U.S. and NATO nuclear policies, including, 
if we can believe it in 1998, a policy that is still on the books 
which is the option of the first use of nuclear weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is really something which is quite horrific, and the 
Canadian people have stated that over and over again.  In fact, a 
recent Angus Reid poll showed the commitment and the strength of 
the Canadian people.  They want to see the abolition of nuclear 
weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to Canada's complicity in the arms trade in not 
fulfilling article VI of the non-proliferation treaty, we can see 
that although this is a good step today, we still have a long, 
long way to go. That is what we are calling on the Canadian 
government to do here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada should stop its Candu reactor sales, for example, to 
countries with poor human rights records such as China and 
Turkey.  Canada could become a nuclear weapons free zone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 1980s at the height of the peace movement in Canada, 
many citizens groups across the country worked very hard to 
convince municipal authorities and local jurisdictions to adopt 
nuclear weapons free zones in Canada.  This is something that 
could be done on a national basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another leadership position Canada could take is it could give 
notice to terminate the agreement between Canada and the U.S. in 
establishing the torpedo testing range at Nanoose Bay in the 
Strait of Georgia, British Columbia. This is something that is 
very close to me and my involvement in the peace movement in B.C. 
The citizens of that area have worked long and hard to put 
pressure on the Canadian government to terminate that agreement 
so that we are not using our waters and our facilities for the 
testing of those submarines.

<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something else that is important is that at the UN, Canada must 
vote in favour of multilateral negotiations that would lead to an 
early conclusion of a nuclear weapons convention.  It is simply 
not good enough to say that we have a comprehensive test ban 
treaty and the non-proliferation treaty.  We need to see on the 
international stage that Canada is taking the lead at the United 
Nations and is not blindly following the position of the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a wonderful thing if Canada would join the new 
agenda coalition of middle power states that are calling on the 
nuclear weapon states to make an unequivocal commitment to enter 
and to conclude negotiations leading to the elimination of 
nuclear weapons. This new agenda coalition is a very significant 
development that has taken place in the last few months.  It is 
something Canada should be part of.  We should not be opposing 
it.  We should be an active participant in the new agenda 
coalition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have a sense of what it is that we can do when we have 
the political will to do it.  We only have to look at the 
leadership Canada showed on land mines to know that as a middle 
power we can generate the momentum, we can generate the 
solidarity of the NGO community as well as various nations to 
work together to produce a land mines convention.  The same can 
be done to abolish nuclear weapons.  This is what the NDP 
believes Canada's role should be.  We believe that very firmly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak about the role of citizens in the peace movement 
and in their work for disarmament.  Governments take actions but 
often they are as a result of the work at the grassroots level, 
the pressure that has come from local communities at a provincial 
level and at a national level.  A saying often used in the peace 
movement is that if the people lead, eventually their leaders 
will follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things I want to do today is pay tribute to the peace 
groups in Canada that have tirelessly committed themselves and 
their very limited resources to a campaign and a movement for the 
abolition of nuclear weapons.  Canada is very involved in the 
campaign Abolition 2000 through the Canadian Network to Abolish 
Nuclear Weapons. That organization has been instrumental in 
galvanizing community support and keeping this issue alive, 
keeping it before the Canadian government and elected 
representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently it had a postcard campaign and distributed 10,000 
postcards.  It called on the Prime Minister to immediately call 
an emergency meeting of all states and negotiate a treaty to 
abolish all nuclear weapons. The organization points out in its 
postcard campaign that in 1996 the World Court ruled that the use 
of nuclear weapons is illegal.  It also points out the recent 
Angus Reid poll that indicated that more than 90% of Canadians 
support nuclear disarmament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the work of the Canadian Network to Abolish Nuclear 
Weapons.  It has worked very hard in an international campaign to 
bring about the sustained pressure not just on our government but 
on other governments to fulfil the obligations of article VI of 
the non-proliferation treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The July 1996 ruling from the World Court gave momentum to the 
movement.  The World Court ruled that the use of nuclear weapons 
violates international and humanitarian law.  It was a very 
significant ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another thing I would like to draw attention to in 
terms of citizen involvement.  In the past year in my province of 
British Columbia our local peace coalition, an organization of 
more than 200 from labour, churches, peace groups, communities 
and women's organizations, called End the Arms Race, organized a 
citizens weapons inspection team.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February of this year I was very proud to be part of a 
delegation that went down to Bangor, Washington, just south of 
Vancouver and south of Seattle in the state of Washington where a 
very large U.S. naval base is located and where the Trident 
submarines are located. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there we conducted a citizens weapons inspection during 
the midst of yet another escalating crisis in the Persian Gulf 
where our Canadian government was prepared to follow the American 
military intervention.  I remember the debate in the House in 
February when my colleagues in the NDP spoke out strongly.  We 
called on the Canadian government to take an independent course 
and to seek a diplomatic resolution instead of military 
intervention and military threat in a region that has suffered so 
badly already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By organizing the citizens weapons inspection team we wanted to 
draw attention to the fact that the most significant weapons of 
mass destruction on the globe are actually located to the south 
in the United States.  We visited Bangor, Washington, and 
attempted to gain access to the site to do a citizens inspection 
and to point out to the commander of the base that stockpiling 
and storage of these weapons on the base was in violation of 
international law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I flew over the huge site in a small airplane and did a visual 
inspection of the vast bunkers and silos that contain weapons of 
mass destruction.  It was a very eerie feeling to fly over the 
base and to see the immense power and resources contained at 
Bangor, Washington.  These resources were ready to be unleashed 
at a moment's notice because the U.S. still has a policy of first 
option in the use of nuclear weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In August 1998 I travelled with a group of citizens to Groton, 
Connecticut, which is the home of the Electric Boat Company, a 
U.S. corporation that produces the delivery system for weapons of 
mass destruction.  It produces the Trident submarine.  We wanted 
to draw attention to the fact that these weapons of mass 
destruction were located very close to us and were in convention 
of international law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we went to Groton, Connecticut, we were also very fortunate 
to visit the United Nations and to meet with the under secretary 
general of disarmament.  We had a very positive meeting with him 
and discussed the necessity for ordinary people to be involved in 
the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the united voice of people from across Canada and around 
the globe that has pressured the United Nations and their own 
domestic governments into adopting the various conventions we now 
see as a small sign of the progress being made.  I was very proud 
to be part of those delegations that included Peter Coombe, 
president of End the Arms Race; Murray Dobbin of the Council of 
Canadians; Edward Schmitt and Phyllis Creighton of the Anglican 
Church of Canada; and David Morgan, a very well know peace 
activist who is president of Veterans Against Nuclear Arms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a testament to the work of these organization that we can 
stand in the House today and feel a sense of optimism and hope in 
the implementation of Bill C-52 respecting the comprehensive 
nuclear test ban treaty that Canada will have taken at least 
another small step toward the abolition of nuclear weapons.  We 
need to do much more and Canada's record has not been great in 
this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Burnaby and other members of the NDP have 
done, I call on the Canadian government to show the leadership 
that it did on the land mines, to show the commitment to abide by 
article 6 of the non-proliferation treaty, and to live up to the 
court ruling of the World Court for all to say once and for all 
that we can rid the world of nuclear weapons.  We can divert the 
billions of dollars expended on infrastructure for nuclear 
weapons and refocus those funds that are desperately needed to 
meet our human needs, not just here in Canada but around the 
world.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
extremely pleased to speak on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-ban 
Treaty Implementation Act.  Part of my great enthusiasm harks 
back to my youth, for when I was 18 or 19 I was very much 
involved in the peace movement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From those years I have always retained my conviction that, if 
we must participate in international life—and heaven knows we 
must—we need to set ourselves the objective of using our powers 
of persuasion within major multilateral forums to convince 
others through the strength of our convictions, the strength of 
our arguments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does a bill like this one tell us?  That we will not accept 
nuclear power as one of the means to maintain international 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rising above all partisan differences, it must be said that 
these ideas have support in Quebec, and in English Canada as 
well, we must acknowledge. The hon. member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry has reminded us in caucus on a number of 
occasions that Canada was a very early signatory of the Nuclear 
Non-proliferation Treaty, as well as the Limited Test Ban Treaty 
of the early sixties.  All this to indicate to you that these 
ideas are part of our political community, for which we should 
rejoice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But where will an act and a treaty such as these lead us?  We 
will have an opportunity to offer a bit of an explanation on the 
mechanisms. 
The act and the treaty are valuable as a model, for we are well 
aware that some states still have nuclear weapons today, and 
others are being tempted, spontaneously—or so one might think, 
anyway—and if there were no pressure from the international 
community, would conclude that there is some security in having 
nuclear arms, in continuing to do research and to increase the 
sophistication of prototypes.  This is a threat to international 
peace, directly and indirectly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One cannot, of course, avoid thinking of India, a place I have 
had the pleasure of visiting.  One does not need to be long in 
India to realize that many other needs need to be addressed and 
other resources developed, rather than investing in nuclear 
weapons production or related technologies.  Then, of course, 
there is Pakistan, and some other countries such as North Korea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By becoming a party to this international treaty, Canada is 
making a commitment to contribute financially to its 
implementation, but also to assume three specific 
responsibilities which I want to mention, even though I am not 
as knowledgeable as the members of the parliamentary committee, 
who worked really hard on this issue. We should explain to those 
who are listening to us today that the signing of this treaty by 
Canada, as one of the 44 countries expected to sign it, means of 
course that we pledge to criminalize nuclear testing in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have an obligation to report any chemical explosion 
greater than 300 tonnes TNT-equivalent. Any breach of this 
obligation will be considered to be an indictable offence. Of 
course, anyone who causes a nuclear explosion, as well as that 
person's associates, will face a jail sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to see that this treaty will also provide us 
with more sophisticated means to detect what could be called a 
nuclear potential.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada will take part in a vast international monitoring system 
that will rely on a number of networks and on countries that 
will allocate resources to make it possible to not only monitor 
but also detect, locate and measure nuclear explosions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can see the preventive nature of this international 
monitoring system, which will use 321 monitoring stations. 
Canada will do its share, since about 15 of these stations will 
operate on its territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is interesting, because an idea is turning into reality. 
This is cause for celebration for those of us who are involved 
in the peace movement. 
This bears repeating. Quebec has traditionally been very 
strongly in favour of denuclearization, in favour of making sure 
no one in the international community can use the nuclear threat 
for coercive purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember being in Montreal—in my early twenties, which is in 
sharp contrast with members whose names I shall withhold—when the 
city was declared a nuclear free zone. I am very pleased with 
the fact that Montreal was one of the first cities in the world 
to make this kind of commitment, and I think we have every 
reason to be proud of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are debating nuclear weapons today, but this is an 
opportunity to make connections with the whole military 
industry. 
As I recall, and my colleagues will also recall this, one of the 
first actions taken by the leader of the Bloc Quebecois, who is 
now the Premier of Quebec and will be for a long time—this is our 
strong belief, and I can see my colleague nodding in agreement, 
he being one of the finest minds of his generation, I might say 
without fear of exaggerating, and above all an extremely wise 
statesman—was to appoint me, the young member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, a dashing idealist, happy to be here while 
not losing sight of the need to defend the interests of Quebec, 
as the critic for conversion of the military industry to 
civilian uses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It all hangs together.  Today, 44 designated governments are 
being asked by the international community to ratify a treaty 
that will ban nuclear testing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In broader terms, we must strive to ensure that the defence 
industry, which has great influence in certain governments, will 
quietly convert to the use of civilian technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have worked very hard, and not alone because you know how 
ineffectual we are on our own, but the Bloc Quebecois as a whole 
quickly understood that in one very modest way, aware of the 
more international stakes, we could change things in our own 
communities by putting pressure on nuclear arms and defence 
technology producers to convert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for us as members of parliament to make this a 
concern, because we know very well that in countries where 
governments could effect the sort of conversion I am talking 
about, it is not done without government help.  For example, the 
United States is resolutely following this route, with the help 
of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When you produce gunpowder, munitions or other items related to 
military technology, you need public support to effect such a 
conversion, to scout out new markets, to change production 
systems and to come up with a better use for civilian purposes.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It all hangs together. The issue of nuclear bans and control and 
the nuclear test ban are an extension of the campaign we in the 
Bloc Quebecois have waged in order to reduce the use of defence 
technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was saying three obligations would ensue from Canada's 
ratification of the comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty.  I 
think it also has to be said that Canada, like Quebec, has a 
responsibility to encourage the designated countries to make a 
commitment quickly in their national parliaments to ratify this 
treaty, which must soon take effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not insignificant that some 20 states have already 
ratified this treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Twenty-one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> The hon. member tells me it is 21. Is that 
right? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is that very quest for accuracy that means she always has the 
latest information available.  What a wonderful team we are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me hasten to add that 21 states have ratified the treaty.  A 
number of these are developing countries.  Others are so-called 
developed countries.  I will list them quickly, so that members 
will know what we are talking about. 
They are:  Jordan, Germany, Grenada—no pun intended, Spain, 
Brazil, Australia, France, the United Kingdom, Austria, 
Slovakia, Peru, Mongolia, Japan, Ecuador and the Fiji Islands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must speak plainly today for the benefit of those listening. 
This is truly an international movement.  It is quite different 
from the situation in 1963 when the first partial test-ban treaty 
was signed, although that was important in its own way, make no 
mistake.  Looking back, however, there is no denying that the 
1963 treaty, with its much shorter list of signatories, was much 
more limited in scope than the treaty we are discussing might 
be.   The same is true of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, as parliamentarians, we can be part of a movement that 
will be echoed in several other parliaments, in press releases 
and in communities, and that will send the clear message that we 
will not accept the use of nuclear arms as a means to express 
one's ideas or to participate in international politics. This is 
an extremely important step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, as a person who has a great deal of experience and 
a wealth of knowledge—as confirmed by your grey hair—you will 
remember that about 30 years ago, when I was a university 
student—it was not that long ago, as I am barely into my 30s—as 
are our young pages, we talked about the balance of terror. 
That was a reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were various schools of thought concerning the 
international situation, including the notion of flexible 
response and that of the balance of terror. At the time, this 
was a preconceived notion in the international community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Public Works will remember that. It was a 
preconceived notion about the possibility, for certain states, 
to own nuclear weapons and, ultimately, to use them. What 
pacifists like the hon. member for Laval East and myself feared 
was of course that these states would not spend so much money 
merely to stockpile nuclear weapons, without thinking of using 
them some day.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we said it did not make sense not to have 
international controls, moratoriums and inspection systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international inspection system is not the only major 
feature of the treaty that we, as parliamentarians, will help 
promote. There will be some 300 sites throughout the world that 
can detect, analyze and process all sophisticated systems and 
movements that may be linked to nuclear weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is this system going to exist—and I am told it will cost 
$6 to $7 million for Canada's 15 or so stations—but as well there 
will be the possibility, if one of the signatory countries 
commits a violation, for pressure to be brought to bear, so that 
other signatories can call for a system of inspection.  If there 
is a refusal to co-operate, the case can be taken as far as the 
security council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is more or less in keeping with Montesquieu's principle of 
equilibrium that the international community will have the 
ability to pressure recalcitrant states and those who refuse to 
honour their signature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us remember, and let us take pride in this and promote it: 
this is a treaty to prevent the use of nuclear testing as a 
provocative symbol of a nation's power.  That is nothing to be 
sneezed at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, we must be clear, this is not something that happens 
automatically.  There are a number of mechanisms that must be 
adhered to for enforcement of the treaty.  What we are 
discussing here is a multilateral approach involving a number of 
states.  The treaty will come into effect 180 days after 
ratification by a certain number of states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there is a reference to 44 designated states.  It must be 
pointed out that Canada is one of these. It has been said 
already that 21 have signed, to be exact, with more to come. 
Canada and Quebec must play a persuasive and promotional role, 
and make their voices heard so as to encourage countries like 
Vietnam, the Ukraine, Turkey and Switzerland to follow suit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Switzerland has long been a model of a peaceful country active 
in international relations. It had a hands-off policy while being 
present anywhere major events were taking place. Many in this 
place have much to learn from this. South Africa and many other 
countries also provided learning experiences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was the train of events. There are five nuclear powers and 
a number of nations that decided on their own, probably with a 
little pressure from the international community, not to join 
the nuclear club. France is a case in point. The French are our 
neighbours across the Atlantic; they are like-minded people. 
However, we must not forget that, until recently, France was 
involved in nuclear testing. It is refreshing, interesting and 
comforting to think that France, along with four other nuclear 
powers, has now agreed to sign the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thrilled to see that, as parliamentarians, we can 
contribute to a better world. This debate today is about the 
future, not the past. We can help build a better world knowing 
that, in a democracy, the best way to support or defeat an idea 
is to put forward a better one. This can only be done in a 
constitutional state, and through persuasion. Persuasion is this 
capacity to debate and exchange ideas in parliament and any 
other elected forum, where the power of words is what gives rise 
to policies.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Tobique-Mactaquac, Royal Canadian Mint; the hon. 
member for Frontenac—Mégantic, BC Mine in Black Lake. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK183"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am very pleased to be able to participate in this debate.  It 
is not often we get to talk about the question of nuclear testing 
or the whole issue of nuclear weapons.  I welcome the opportunity 
to do so.  We certainly do not intend to obstruct the passage of 
this particular bill.  I think all parties in the House are 
agreed that it should pass with dispatch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, it does provide an opportunity to comment on a 
very pressing and urgent matter and that is the future of the 
planet.  If current conditions are allowed to persist a false 
sense of safety which a lot of people acquired as a result of the 
end of the cold war may come to a horrible end when we realize 
that we actually live in a world that is arguably much more 
dangerous than the world that we rightly perceived as dangerous 
during the cold war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of my particular generation I have perhaps been more 
sensitive to this issue than some others.  I am a baby boomer.  I 
am part of the post-Hiroshima generation.  I was born in the 
fifties and was exposed as a child in western Canada to all the 
fallout from American testing in the northwestern United States, 
the consequences of which we are still learning about through 
studies that come forward.  Most recently a study came forward 
with respect to this particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember very well being a grade 6 student at Westview 
Elementary in Transcona in 1962 when the Cuban missile crisis was 
upon us.  I remember going to school that afternoon, after having 
been home for lunch, knowing that sometime in the early afternoon 
the Russian ships would meet the American blockade.  It was 
uncertain whether that would be the end of the world.  At least 
that was the way it was seen, that it would be the beginning of a 
nuclear conflagration which would destroy the human race.  It is 
something that has always stuck with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As children we experienced terror.  We practised bombing 
exercises where we would hide under our desks.  We learned how to 
peel bananas because that was the only kind of food we would be 
able to eat, as everything else would be radioactive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say all this by way of being very grateful in many respects 
that my own children have not had to experience the nearness and 
the proximity of nuclear weapons and nuclear war in that way. But 
having said that, the fact remains that their future and the 
future of the human prospect is every bit as much in peril today 
as it was then.  It is just that we have convinced ourselves that 
this is no longer the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many more nuclear weapons and many more powerful 
nuclear weapons in the world today than there were when I was 
that grade 6 child worrying about the destruction of the human 
race.  There is much less control over the nuclear weapons that 
exist in the world today than there was in 1962 when I was having 
my first experience with nuclear terror. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need to do today is say yes.  Let us ratify the 
comprehensive test ban treaty, but let us realize that the real 
task for the human race and for the planet is to abolish nuclear 
weapons entirely, once and for all, and seize the moment which is 
now before us after the end of the cold war to do so.  If we do 
not do it soon we will live in a world in which nuclear weapons 
will have proliferated all across the world.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will not only be India and Pakistan.  It will be country 
after country after country acquiring nuclear weapons capability 
as a way of saying they have status in the world, as a way of 
saying they want to be powerful players in the world.  This kind 
of nuclear technology is more and more available as a result of 
the end of the cold war and the way it ended, which is to say as 
a result of the rather chaotic disintegration of the Soviet Union 
and the way in which nuclear technology, technicians and 
equipment have become available on the black market and 
officially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a very dangerous world.  I believe the Canadian 
government should be showing a lot more leadership than it is in 
trying to get members of the nuclear club to face up to their 
responsibilities in this critical historical moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We belong to NATO and in NATO we have Britain, France and the 
United States, three of the more powerful members of the nuclear 
club.  We also have Russia which is affiliated with NATO in the 
NATO-Russia Council.  We have a context in which real moral 
pressure, and ultimately more moral than political pressure, 
could be put on these members of the nuclear club to do what is 
right now for all time and for all human beings that will come 
into existence in the future and whose potential existence is 
threatened at this time by inaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a great deal of self-righteousness in the House and 
across the land when India and Pakistan tested nuclear weapons. 
To some extent that outrage was justified.  However in another 
way it was not.  In another way it was a form of hypocrisy in the 
sense that the NATO countries and anyone else who as part of the 
nuclear club pointed the finger at India and Pakistan were acting 
in a hypocritical way if they were not willing to entertain the 
notion of total nuclear disarmament, of the abolition of nuclear 
weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the absence of a commitment by the existing nuclear club to 
do so, it seems to me that India, Pakistan and other countries to 
follow will have an argument which I feel they should be deprived 
of.  They can only be deprived of that argument if the members of 
the nuclear club act appropriately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is part of that club.  We make a big deal about how we do 
not have nuclear weapons.  However, we have been part of this 
thing from the beginning, from the Manhattan project on.  We have 
also been part of it through our own nuclear industry, the export 
of reactors, and our general commitment to nuclear technology 
even though we always say it is for peaceful purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some repenting and rethinking to do on this.  We have an 
opportunity to show some leadership.  I would certainly hope we 
would do so and do so soon for the sake of the people to follow 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nuclear weapons are just a form of warfare that we deplore when 
we see it in microcosm.  When we see civilians in Kosovo or 
anywhere else being tortured, killed, having their houses burned 
and their homes destroyed, we think that is terrible, despicable 
and evil.  We want something to be done about that and something 
should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what is nuclear war except a massive hostage taking of 
the civilian populations of other countries, basically saying 
that we would do on a scale which is unimaginable what we find 
contemptible and disgusting on a small scale?  How have we 
managed to do this to ourselves in our imagination that we can 
counsel as realpolitik, as good strategic thinking, the wholesale 
destruction of the planet and entire civilian populations when we 
reject this on a much smaller scale?  Somehow it does not strike 
us the same way in both cases, and that is unacceptable.

distinguished American diplomat, a cold war diplomat, who 
said—and I am paraphrasing because I do not have the quote with 
me—something to the effect that the intention of the west, or 
for that matter anyone else, to destroy creation, to put at risk 
the future of planet earth, the human prospect and the lives of 
all the non-human creatures that also exist on this planet, is 
nothing more than the ultimate blasphemy offered up to God, 
saying we reject your creation; we reject our role as creatures; 
and we are going to set ourselves up not as gods but in this case 
as demons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who would even think, for the sake of a particular civilization, 
for the sake of a particular economic system or for the sake of a 
particular strategic stance, of destroying the human prospect? It 
is a blasphemy and something I hope the human race will very soon 
erase from its midst.

signed in New York in September 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will know that one of the provisions of that treaty 
is a commitment in article 6 by nuclear weapons states to move 
toward complete prohibition of nuclear weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will also know that later this fall a resolution is 
coming before the United Nations General Assembly from the new 
agenda coalition including South Africa, Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, 
Mexico, New Zealand, Slovenia and Sweden.  That resolution will 
be urging the nuclear weapons states to proceed to an early 
conclusion of a nuclear weapons convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year Canada chose not to support this resolution.  Will

about accelerating the movement of nuclear weapons states to make 
a commitment to get rid of nuclear weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What action is the minister prepared to undertake to the House 
to encourage NATO as part of its strategic concept review, which

departments with an interest and an obligation under the act, the 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, the

felt it would be better to provide a consortium of activities 
that would provide a certain unified approach as opposed to 
simply having one department and then having to borrow.  It would 
not require additional person years. They would be assigned from 
the departments themselves to work in the authority.

refers to the Minister of Health.  My question is about an issue 
that has a profound impact on the environment and the health of 
Canadians, particularly those of us in British Columbia.  It 
concerns the continued testing of nuclear arms and nuclear 
powered submarines at the Nanoose testing range in British 
Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister not recognize the very serious concerns of 
British Columbians about the continued use of the testing base at 
Nanoose Bay?  Will he not give serious consideration to giving 
notice, as permitted under the provisions of the agreement 
between Canada and the United States, to terminate that agreement 
as a concrete manifestation of this government's concern about 
the potential impact of nuclear powered submarines and 
potentially nuclear armed submarines in Canadian waters?

Mr. Chairman, to my knowledge there is no evidence of any nuclear

</I></B></P><P align=left>Submarines in that area are self-contained and highly monitored 
in terms of whatever radioactivity may emit from the area.  There 
is no evidence from anything that I have been able to gather that

have a reciprocal agreement with the United States on testing

is under operation and I see no reason for changing that.

supplementary to the minister on the same issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has referred to the environmental consequences of 
the Nanoose testing range.  I want to ask the minister whether he 
is prepared to table with the foreign affairs committee any 
environmental assessments that have been done on the impact of 
this testing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know one of the concerns that the Nanoose conversion campaign 
has and many British Columbians who have looked at this range 
have is precisely that it seems difficult to get at any 
comprehensive environmental assessment of the impact of the

publicly available.

that it is a precedent of course for treaties in the future, is 
really and truly beyond the scope of this bill.  I would submit

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp: </B>Mr. Chairman, in November of last year, when 
the House was debating the bill to implement the land mines 
treaty, I moved a similar amendment, and we debated it with the 
minister and a number of members.  I would not agree that it is 
out of order and I would like this to be debated today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will recall that last year, when we were debating 
the bill to implement the land mines treaty, we introduced a 
similar amendment.  Although we recognize that this amendment 
would change the way treaties are concluded, we still think it 
would be useful to raise this point today, as a second bill is 
being introduced in the current session of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois think it important to democratize the 
process Canada follows in concluding its treaties by calling 
upon the House of Commons to debate treaties, including amending 
treaties, like the one we are being asked to implement through 
the legislative process today, before Canada signs them and 
agrees to be bound by them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Treaties today are of such importance they must now be examined 
and discussed by the House of Commons and by Parliament. 
I would like to point out to the minister and my colleagues here 
that the practice in most of the governments of the 
Commonwealth, which share the parliamentary tradition of this 
House, is gradually evolving, be it in Australia, New Zealand 
or, more recently still, in the United Kingdom itself, where 
Parliament is much more closely involved than the House of 
Commons here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are proposing this amendment to initiate a practice that 
should be applied not only to amending treaties, but to all 
bilateral or multilateral treaties signed by Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our opinion, it is not sufficient that ministers—including 
the Minister for International Trade, and more so than the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs—involve the foreign affairs 
committee in the debate on certain treaties, as was done in the 
past with the Multilateral Agreement on Investment, or now with 
a treaty that Canada intends to sign with the European Free 
Trade Association.

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was barely a few days ago that the parliamentary secretary to 
the Minister for International Trade asked the Standing 
Committee on Foreign Affairs to take part in the debate that is 
beginning on that treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not enough to consult Parliament. Parliament should 
approve treaties before the government signs and ratifies them. 
Such is the purpose of the amendment. It seeks to change a 
practice, but that practice must be changed. It must be changed, 
so that what we experienced with the Multilateral Agreement on 
Investment—and which we may experience again if the government 
tries to prevent Parliament from debating such important 
treaties—will not happen again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, this is why are proposing an amendment which is minor but 
which would indeed make the government more accountable to this 
House when it signs treaties, including amending treaties. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Chairman, the hon. member was accurate when he said that we 
had this debate when we brought in the anti-personnel land mines 
treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same basic question remains.  This is not a slight 
modification or amendment.  It is a major constitutional change. 
What it recommends is that we begin moving toward a republican 
form of government, the cabinet style of government where 
parliament holds executives accountable, and the executive has to 
negotiate and deal with treaties.  That would change in a very 
fundamental way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure members at this stage, at the clause by clause 
discussion of the bill on comprehensive treaties, are prepared to 
undertake the significance and weight of making a major 
constitutional change.  In a very practical way it would 
substantially alter the capacity of Canada to negotiate and deal 
with treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would cause the same kind of problems that the United States 
is now finding itself in, where it can sign treaties but never 
have them ratified.  Unfortunately, that country has a long 
inventory of treaties which it is unable to ratify because of the 
requirement of the Senate to give its approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In cases where there is a disagreement between the executive 
branch and the legislative branch, it is simply not ratifying 
them.  It is not even close to ratifying this treaty, as well as 
many other treaties that have similar kinds of context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately in our system we have that capacity.  The 
parliamentary system, in my humble view, is superior from that 
point of view.  When the government makes a commitment 
internationally and it has a majority, it has the capacity to 
hold the pleasure of the House in making that kind of change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the hon. member, as experience has proven, we go out of 
our way to ensure that parliament is consulted.  We have 
fundamentally changed the rules by which we work in the House in 
terms of any international action that we are going to take.  We 
have debates in parliament.  If parliament is not sitting or if 
it is not convenient, we go to the committees.  In the case of 
these treaties, when they require legislative changes, we bring 
them in for full debate, such as we are having today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point in time it would be very unwise to sneak in the 
back door, by way of amendment to this particular bill, something 
that would change the Constitution.  If the hon. member wants to 
change the Constitution, there are other ways of doing it rather 
than doing it through this kind of format. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the indulgence of the House to say that the object 
of this bill is to have a comprehensive test ban treaty, to which 
Canada is a signatory, and not to change the Constitution. 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Chairman, the 
minister has stated a couple of things that make the hair on the 
back of my neck stand up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard that the government can go off and sign international 
bills because it has a majority.  Thirty-eight per cent of the 
people in this country voted for this government.  That is not a 
majority.  Sixty-two per cent did not. 
The arrogance of saying that we can sign whatever we want because 
of that is a little bit hard to take.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also find it hard to take that we have gone off with the 
international court and with Kyoto.  We have signed agreements 
and have not consulted the premiers or this parliament and we 
have not listened to Canadians.  We say this is right and that 
this is democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Chairman, that is not democracy.  Canadians are starting to 
demand that we have a democratic system where we have 
transparency and openness, and where responsible decisions are 
made by members of the House.  To say that we fairly and 
democratically debate in the House or in committee is a long 
stretch of the imagination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment is relatively simple and straightforward.  It 
simply asks for some accountability from the Department of 
Foreign Affairs before international treaties are put forward and 
signed and that we would go to our colleagues in the House to ask 
their opinion.  It is rather offensive to think that we would not 
listen to the people in a case like this. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson:</B> Mr. Chairman, I will be very brief in 
saying that, on behalf of my colleagues from the New Democratic 
Party, I support the amendment proposed by the hon. member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened carefully to the minister's reply but, frankly, I 
think this amendment would give a little more power to members 
of Parliament from all parties. Should the amendment be 
rejected, I hope the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs will 
take an in-depth look at the issue raised by the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the House will adopt the motion. I realize this is a 
situation where we do not have the numbers required. But if the 
amendment is rejected here, I hope the committee can conduct a 
thorough review of this issue. 
This is an important proposal and we support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B> Mr. Chairman, with all due respect to the 
minister, I do not think it can be claimed that an amendment 
such as this would change the form of the government.  It would 
not take on the republican form he claims it would, because 
similar states such as Australia, New Zealand and the United 
Kingdom have changed their conventional practices for the 
signing of treaties.  But this does not mean that either 
Australia or New Zealand, much less the United Kingdom, have 
turned into republics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite simply, all that is involved is changing a practice 
relating to the government's constitutional jurisdiction over 
the signing of treaties.  At present, because of royal 
prerogative, the source of the federal government's jurisdiction 
in this area, parliament is not involved. 
This means that neither the House of Commons nor the Senate are 
involved in this process, which is now so very important.  It is 
important because so many treaties impact on daily life, for 
instance the multilateral investment agreement or any other 
agreement that impacts greatly on the legislation we enact or on 
what people do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, this is not a constitutional debate or a constitutional 
amendment, but rather a proposal for changing a practice that is 
totally undemocratic.  It is not true that, under a presidential 
and parliamentary system like the one in the US, the government 
would be deprived of its means of negotiating treaties. 
In a system like ours, the government has the majority in the 
House anyway, or at the very least, in exception cases, it has 
to form a coalition with other parties to secure a voting 
majority.

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the proposal to give Parliament a role in the signing of 
treaties would not in any way deprive the government of its 
power to negotiate international treaties with its partners or 
as a member of organisations or a participant at international 
conferences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I think that there must be a debate each time an 
implementation act is introduced and that is why I propose such 
a debate today. I am very glad to say that my colleagues from 
the NDP and those from the Reform agree with the Bloc Quebecois 
on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by asking the Minister of Foreign Affairs to 
respond positively to the request made by the hon. member from 
the New Democratic Party and to formally ask the foreign affairs 
committee to examine the practice concerning the signing of 
treaties. This could lead to changes similar to those 
implemented in other countries like Australia, New Zealand and 
the United Kingdom, which are far ahead of Canada, a fact that 
can only be explained by than the refusal of the government to 
involve members of parliament and parliament itself in the 
signing of treaties, which are so important as this century is 
coming to a close and certainly be important in the next.

minister the question my hon. colleague just asked, which is 
would the minister agree to the suggestion made by the NDP 
member and refer the issue to the foreign affairs committee to 
ensure that in the future we have a more reality-based approach 
to managing this kind of initiative, since we know that 
parliaments based on the British tradition, such as Australia, 
New-Zealand, the United Kingdom, do so.

help avoid similar debates in the future and lead to some kind 
of compromise? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to raise another point in favour of our amendment. 
Even though it were to be an exception, would it not be 
appropriate in the case of the act to implement the 
Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, to pass this amendment? 
These are major issues that concern the very future of our 
society and deal with very important elements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to remind the House that, under this legislation, 
signatories make a commitment not to carry out nuclear weapon 
test blasts. This is serious business, very important stuff. 
These are major issues that relate to our responsibilities as 
parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this specific bill, would it not be better to pass the 
amendment so that the legislation can be considered, even if it 
means that it would then be referred to the foreign affairs

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA SMALL BUSINESS FINANCING ACT

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from October 2 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-53, an act to increase the availability of financing 
for the establishment, expansion, modernization and improvement 
of small businesses, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee; and of the motion that the question be now put.

<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke—Lakeshore, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted to speak to Bill C-53, an act to increase 
the availability of financing for the establishment, expansion, 
modernization and improvement of small businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The small business financing act is an extension of the Small 
Business Loans Act which was passed in 1961.  It builds on the 
government's commitment to provide small businesses with better 
access to financing by guaranteeing loans made by lenders to 
small and medium size businesses across Canada.  Small businesses 
play an important role in Canada's economy.  Canada has more than 
2.5 million small businesses.  In 1996-97 small businesses 
created 81% of new jobs in the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Etobicoke—Lakeshore there are over 3,600 small 
and medium size enterprises.  They are an integral part of the 
economic infrastructure of Etobicoke—Lakeshore.  The operation 
of these businesses cuts across the manufacturing and service 
sectors of the economy.  They are the main engines of employment 
in my riding and elsewhere in Canada.  Maintaining a strong and 
vibrant economy is vital to the economic success of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians we must support measures that would 
facilitate economic growth in Canada.  I support the small 
business financing act because I know that providing 
opportunities to companies through financing or technology will 
give the Canadian economy the energy it needs to grow.  This 
sector of the Canadian economy has proven to benefit many 
Canadians.  It is necessary to take the steps that would enable 
it to become healthier, to expand and to become more profitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-53 will ensure that small businesses will continue to be 
of benefit to all communities across Canada.  Through successive 
prebudget consultations and town hall meetings with small 
business owners on job strategy and economic growth I heard from 
my constituents about the difficulties faced by small businesses 
in obtaining financing for start-up capital from banks and other 
lending institutions.  The small business financing act, as the 
Small Business Loans Act, will continue to address this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1961 the Small Business Loans Act has provided over $22 
billion worth of debt financing through lending institutions.  As 
many as 30,000 lending firms serve clients that are small and 
young businesses with an average loan size of $68,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not an understatement to say that small companies need 
financial assistance from the government.  Despite the 
availability of capital and increases in lending, access to 
credit continues to be identified by entrepreneurs as a major 
obstacle to the growth of small businesses.  I am pleased to see 
that the government will continue its commitment to providing 
finances to small and medium size business communities through 
the small business financing act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In times of economic downturn we know small businesses are the 
most vulnerable.  In my riding during the recession of the late 
1980s and early 1990s many small businesses folded as a result of 
the cyclical downturn in the economy.  Many companies did not 
have the financial resources to wait or to ride out the 
recession.

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada small business financing act is about creating 
stability for small and medium size businesses.  It will put many 
small and medium size businesses on a sound, stable footing to 
better cope and manage under financial stress and, in particular, 
during times of economic downturn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill was put before the House after extensive consultations 
with public and private stakeholders.  The Minister of Industry 
has also taken into account the recommendations of the Standing 
Committee on Public Accounts and the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the act the small business financing program will extend 
loans to lenders for terms of up to 10 years.  Lenders must pay a 
one time 2% fee in addition to an annual registration fee of 
1.25%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are so many things to say about the benefits that this 
will ensure to my constituents of Etobicoke—Lakeshore.  Suffice 
it to say that micro and very small businesses will benefit from 
Bill C-53. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In examining the issue of cost recovery and the key areas of the 
bill I call on my colleagues on all sides of the House to give 
support to Bill C-53.  It is a very important bill and the issues 
it covers would do much for the businesses in our various and 
varying communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, Canada's small business loans program is one of the 
best programs of all the OECD countries.  It is a very crucial 
segment of our economy and Canadians have come to depend on it 
for their economic livelihood.  I encourage all of my colleagues, 
keeping in mind the micro and small businesses in the various and 
varying constituencies, to give support to the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
commend the member who just spoke in support of small business. 
It is very important that we all support small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we see what is happening with the very large corporations 
and institutions that are laying off people.  In my riding of 
Halifax West the Volvo assembly plant is being shut down, putting 
about 250 people out of work.  Volvo is moving to places like 
Mexico where it can profit from cheaper labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the people faced with joblessness are going to have to 
resort to their own ingenuity to operate small businesses and to 
become self-employed to earn a living.  Therefore, everything 
that can be done to assist small business is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see the large banks in our society trying to become even 
larger, we ask ourselves what the impact will be on small 
business people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in support of the measures being taken to assist small 
business and on behalf of my constituents I will support the 
legislation.  I commend the member opposite for her remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I always appreciate 
support when it is given from the other side of the floor and, 
therefore, do not have to shout recall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada small business financing act will do a number of 
things that are very important.  It will guarantee lending on 
April 1, 1999 and continue to facilitate asset based debt 
financing to small and medium companies with annual sales of up 
to $5 million.  Those are the small businesses in his riding and 
in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will continue to share the risks of loans to 
businesses by paying 85% of the loss incurred by lenders.  These 
are measures that will be appreciated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will pay claims on 90% of the first $250,000 of 
loans in a lender's account, 50% on the next $250,000 and 10% on 
the remaining loans.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures will be beneficial to those medium size 
enterprises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The percentage of the cost of eligible capital assets accepted 
for financing would be 90%.  This again will include so many of 
our businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interest ceilings remain at 3% above prime lending rates for 
variable rate loans or 3% above residential mortgage rates for 
fixed rate loans.  These measures will benefit all of our 
constituents.  Therefore it is essential that we support this 
bill and give our small and medium size businesses a break. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
join the support for small business.  We know that it is the 
backbone of the nation.  I am always pleased to speak up for 
small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is one thing that bothers me about this tax and grab 
government.  Small businesses all across this country are saying 
loud and clear that the guys in Ottawa have to get off their 
backs.  More than that, they are saying that the government needs 
to get out of their pockets because they are being killed by 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about lending money and getting into debt to 
support small business, but we never hear anything coming from 
that side of the House about how we need to make it more feasible 
for these people to operate by lowering the taxes which are 
killing small businesses and jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One particular business in my riding is run by a man and his 
wife.  They have said to me “If we could only get the taxes cut 
back to some degree we could hire some additional help, rather 
than both of us having to be here from nine to seven every day. 
We work hard.  We have to in order to pay all the taxes that this 
government keeps grabbing”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member suggest to small business that it would be a 
good idea to pursue decreasing taxes?  That would help 
them even more than lending them more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
his question because I know that he is concerned about the small 
businesses in his riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes it is very difficult for members opposite to take good 
news and to carry the good news back to where it should be 
carried.  I want to tell the member to look on the side of the 
positive aspects of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of taxes, of course, is a concern to all small 
businesses.  But when we look at our position in the G-7, our 
small businesses and business people, in comparison to other 
places in the world, are definitely not in last place. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would ask the hon. member for 
Etobicoke—Lakeshore if we can take back the good news that her 
government will give back to small businesses the EI overcharge 
it is taking from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we take that good news back to our constituents? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are debating the 
topic of small business in Bill C-53 and we are asking if there 
is support for the bill.  The member has introduced EI.  Of 
course, any good news is good news that we will take forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When that discussion does come up, the good news will certainly 
be hers to take forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is the House ready 
for the question?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been considerable interest in the bill by many 
Canadians.  Thousands of them have signed petitions which have 
been presented in the House.  Many are watching now and they will 
read the debates as they are reported in <I>Hansard</I>. However, 
they may not understand the procedure and what is going on. I 
propose to talk for a few minutes about the procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is Private Members' Business and my bill has not been 
deemed votable.  Therefore it is entitled to up to one hour of 
debate tonight, after which it will be dropped from the Order 
Paper without a vote. I am permitted a 15-minute speech and a 
five minute wrap up. Other members are entitled to speak for no 
more than 10 minutes each, up to a maximum of 40 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to use my initial 15 minutes to briefly outline some of 
the intricacies of Private Members' Business as I am sure most 
Canadians are not familiar with this aspect of our rules.  I wish 
to discuss my bill and why I believe it is needed now.  In my 
wrap up I shall try to deal with some of the points made by other 
hon. members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like many other members, I have drafted bills and motions.  Our 
names are put into a drum.  Once in a while a draw is held.  My 
name was picked and I chose to put forward Bill C-225. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rules try to ensure that there are about 15 public bills and 
15 motions on the Order Paper at all times.  A subcommittee of 
the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs known as 
the Subcommittee on Private Members' Business meets to select 
five motions and five bills to deem as votable.  This procedure 
continues as bills and motions are dealt with in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my case there was room for only one bill to be chosen votable 
as there are still four votable bills on the Order Paper.  A 
number of bills were vying for this one slot, including mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The subcommittee consists of six members of parliament:  two 
Liberals, one Reform, one Bloc Quebecois, one NDP and one PC. The 
committee listened to the submissions of the MPs and chose 
another bill as votable.  No reasons were given and none are 
required to be given under our rules.  Only one-third of the 
committee is members of the governing Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill which I consider so important gets one hour of debate 
and then disappears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a thumbnail sketch of how we got here tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning to the substance of the bill, section 1 reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A marriage is void unless it is a legal union of one man and one 
woman as husband and wife and neither the man nor the woman was 
married immediately prior to that union. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing startling there.  It is the definition that we 
have always known in Canada.  I presume most people would think 
that it is already in the law of Canada.  It is not.  The purpose 
of my bill is to enshrine in statute that a marriage is valid 
only when it is a marriage between one unmarried man and one 
unmarried woman.  In other words, neither multiple parties nor 
parties of the same sex may get married. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked both the previous justice minister and the present 
justice minister to support the bill.  You will hear from the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice or some other 
designated member of parliament as to why the justice minister 
does not support the bill, but I will tell you now what those 
reasons are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that has been stated in a letter by both the 
previous and present justice ministers is the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The definition of marriage in federal law is not in a statute 
passed by Parliament, but is found in what is called the federal 
common law, dating from an 1866 British case of Hyde and Hyde v 
Woodmansee.  This case has been applied consistently in Canada 
and states that no marriage can exist between two persons of the 
same sex, or between multiple wives or husbands.  Thus, the 
definition of marriage is already clear in law in Canada as the 
union of two persons of the opposite sex. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the justice ministers have said in writing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important to note in this statement is that the 
definition of marriage is to be found in federal common law. 
Common law is, plain and simple, judge made law. 
Therefore, it can be changed at any time by judges.  There is no 
statute to guide or restrain judges.

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Justice has indicated in writing reasons why 
it does not support the bill.  According to the Department of 
Justice one of the reasons is that it is clear in federal law 
what a marriage is.  That is not an accurate statement of the 
law.  Why do I say this?  Because there are numerous continuing 
challenges in our courts to this definition, both by those who 
wish same sex unions to be recognized as marriages and those 
whose religious beliefs permit multiple wives or husbands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One case will illustrate this point.  The case is Layland and 
Beaulne v Ontario Minister of Consumer and Commercial Relations, 
Attorney General of Canada, et al.  In this case decided by three 
judges of Ontario in the divisional court, two male homosexuals 
sued to force the province of Ontario to issue them a licence to 
marry.  If as the justice department states the definition 
of marriage is already clear in law, we would have expected a 
unanimous decision against the applicants.  In fact, the decision 
was two to one. I will read some brief excerpts from the 
dissenting judgment: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am of the view that restricting marriages to heterosexual 
couples infringes and violates the applicants' section 15(1) 
charter rights and that such violation cannot be justified under 
section 1 of the charter.  I also agree with the position of the 
church that there is no common law prohibition against same sex 
marriages in Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case the church was the Metropolitan Community Church of 
Ottawa. She goes on: “In the opening paragraph of these reasons, 
I have noted that the common law must grow to meet society's 
expanding needs.... To say that the state must preserve only 
traditional heterosexual families is discriminatory and contrary 
to the equal benefits and guarantees they”—that is, 
homosexuals—“are entitled to at law.... A rule with a discriminatory 
purpose may not be justified under section 1”—of the charter. 
“Further, I agree with counsel for the applicants that there is 
no rational connection between supporting heterosexual families 
and denying homosexuals the right to marry.  It is illogical and 
has no beneficial impact on the goal.  To deny them the right to 
marry is a complete denial of their relationship and a denial of 
their constitutional rights”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the law is clear as the justice minister and the justice 
department state that it is, then this judge should never have 
made these statements in a dissenting judgment.  The fact is that 
in the next such application, the dissenting judge could find an 
ally and the decision could be two to one in the opposite 
direction.  This is entirely possible and predictable since the 
current law is judge made common law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the law is to be clear as the justice ministers would have us 
believe, it must be confirmed in statutory form so that a judge 
cannot draw the conclusions drawn by the dissenting judge in 
Leyland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice department is just plain wrong to say the bill is 
unnecessary.  They say that the usual legislative principle is to 
legislate only to cure a legal problem or advance a legal issue. 
Bill C-225 cures a legal problem, namely the incorrect thinking 
of the dissenting judge and allies she may have in the judiciary, 
and it advances a legal issue, namely that only single people of 
the opposite sex are permitted to marry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Justice contends that the same concept of 
marriage is present throughout the world.  This also is not 
accurate.  A very large part of the world condones multiple 
marriage partners, something foreign to our society.  Indeed, 
Queen Elizabeth recently visited the Sultan of Brunei who 
together with his two wives hosted a state dinner for the Queen. 
Bill C-225 would confirm that marriage in Canada does not include 
multiple spouses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there a move to legitimize bigamy or polygamy?  Let me quote 
from an October 1, 1998 article by Stephanie Nolen in the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I>, a newspaper that has been pushing for the 
legitimization of same sex relationships for years.  Members 
will not believe it.  Talk about current.  The editor's note 
reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No need to waste it, so a growing number of couples think.  They 
have embraced an alternative to the married-couple-for-life 
scenario, a style of relationship called “polyamory” where 
primary partners branch out to other partners, but in committed 
relationships too. 
But in an age when the traditional idea of marriage is taking it 
on the chin, polyamory makes some sense.  Read on.

</I></B></P><P align=left>To quote from the article: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Polyamory (loving more than one) means maintaining intimate 
relationships with several people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“There are greater numbers and greater acceptance for 
polyamory” says Brett Hill, co-editor of Loving More. “It's 
definitely changed since we started publishing 15 years ago”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poly relationships range from the couple in a long-term union 
who each see other people casually, to the committed threesome, 
to the polyfidelitous groups living a “married” life in 
multi-adult households. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even child raising is better when you are poly, the proponents 
say. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Boy, talk about poly.  The next step is the legitimization of 
polyamory and trying to get a marriage licence for three, four or 
five partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice department's considered legal opinion as the chief 
adviser to the chief law officer of the crown is “this bill 
risks opening further debate”.  Oh my goodness.  Debate.  The 
legal advice of this department is that it risks opening further 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada needs a new law firm because that is 
not legal advice.  That is political advice.  This is the place 
for society's policies to be debated and decided, not in the 
policy cubicles of the Department of Justice and not by judge 
made law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, an avowed homosexual, 
in debate on Monday, June 8 made the following comments with 
which I wholeheartedly agree: “It is true that we would like the 
members of this House to make known their views on recognition of 
same sex spouses. To be sure, a debate must take place. Reformers 
are right when they say it is unacceptable in a democracy to 
leave it to judges to make the decisions. My colleague is right 
saying that this debate should be held in the House.  We must 
vote on an important matter such as this”.  He was talking about 
same sex benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, Bill C-225 is the vehicle to have this debate. 
The concept of marriage as it has always been in Canada is under 
attack.  It continues to take it on the chin, as the <I>Globe</I> 
article put it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time that the definition of marriage as the union of a 
single male and a single female was taken out of the hands of 
judges and judge made law and judge changed common law and put 
into a statute of the Parliament of Canada expressing the will of 
the people of Canada.  Since the definition in Bill C-225 is 
argued by the justice department and the justice minister to be 
clear and since the justice minister has written “counsel from 
my department have successfully defended and will continue to 
defend this concept of marriage in court”, there can be no 
logical reason not to enshrine the principle in statute law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only real reason for not supporting this bill is fear of 
debate.  That is not only shameful but it is truly lamentable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the House to support this bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
today we are debating a bill that would formalize in law that a 
marriage is between a man and a woman.  It is clear legislative 
recognition that it is the union of a man and a woman 
intentionally for life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes when I am back in my riding of Calgary Centre, 
constituents will eagerly with hope in their eyes want to know 
some of the details of the affairs of the nation. I can 
anticipate some confused looks, perhaps some perplexity and 
frustration when I advise them that the state of the nation and 
the time of this great House and hon. members and of course your 
valuable time, Mr. Speaker, and all at the taxpayers' expense has 
been to debate what a marriage is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My office did some research on the history and current laws 
surrounding marriage in Canada.  I studied it and began building 
my presentation for today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could quote from 130-plus years of history, from 1886 to 1995, 
of case law in this country that powerfully enshrines marriage as 
a voluntary union for life of one man and one woman to the 
exclusion of all others, or the many legal statements that 
profoundly point out that marriage is an institution upon which 
the family is built.

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could have detailed the respective roles of the federal 
government and the provincial governments concerning marriage and 
have shown through a detailed analysis that the federal 
government establishes the legal framework and capacity for 
marriage. However, it is the provinces that enact the laws which 
provide for the solemnization and the formal marriage ceremony. 
Or, I could have gone outside Canada and examined marriage down 
through the ages.  It is easy to demonstrate that a one man-one 
woman for life definition of marriage has been the norm in most 
stable cultures from the beginning of recorded history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I began down each of these tracks but something was missing.  It 
seemed I was just repeating the obvious.  Men and women get 
married.  It is recognized by law.  Marriage is a quality 
institution that has been around since the beginning of recorded 
history.  However this was not touching the heart of the issue we 
have before us today.  It seems to me there is something deeper 
that needs to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the storm of ideas in today's life it seems we have forgotten 
some of the basics.  We have been intimidated by accusations of 
discrimination when we point out that there are differences.  We 
have been barraged with the call for equality.  Then it is 
implied that when things are equal they become the same.  We know 
it is not true.  Some things are different, just as some 
relationships are different from others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why marriage?  How does it work?  Perhaps by considering these 
questions we will be more clear on what is best, no matter what 
we call it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marriage as it is currently understood is an inclusive 
arrangement, I would argue.  Does it not include both genders? 
Neither one is excluded.  Is it not inclusive?  The equality of 
the sexes must not be confused with the sameness of the sexes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In marriage a man in relationship with a woman gains insights, 
sensitivities and strengths that she brings to the relationship, 
and vice versa for the woman with the man.  This intimate 
relationship between a man and a woman involves giving time to 
understand the other person's perspectives on the challenges that 
life brings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lifelong committed union of a man and a woman in marriage 
creates a unit that is stronger than the sum of the individuals 
because the differences complement one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a prominent Canadian court case the ruling read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marriage has many other characteristics of which companionship 
and mutual support is an important one. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court also stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marriage is the institution on which the family is built and with 
the capacity for natural heterosexual intercourse as an essential 
element. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about children?  The children of a marriage should be 
considered.  Teachers, and my wife is one, have a saying.  They 
say that more is caught than taught.  Intimate, committed 
marriage provides the best possible learning ground for the 
socialization and character development of children.  Boys who 
have a lifelong example of a father who is patient with his wife, 
kind, polite to her, calm, forgives, is truthful, is trusted and 
is protective toward his wife are more likely to be that way 
themselves.  More is caught than taught. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same concept applies for daughters.  Both genders learn from 
myriad subtle character messages that children pick up from 
different gender parents.  These models help them to decide and 
to relate to their own life mate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of positive character modelling within and across 
genders does not stay confined to the home but continues with the 
children outside the home and adds to the stabilizing and 
strengthening component of society as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent Statistics Canada studies record that children in home 
relationships with both parents have far fewer behavioural 
problems and a significantly higher percentage complete high 
school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, we celebrate anniversaries in this land.  I am 
sure, Mr. Speaker, you have sent out congratulatory comments to 
those who celebrate anniversaries.  When we talk to these people, 
happily married men and women, about marriage they talk about it 
in terms of entering into a marriage covenant, not a contract. A 
contract states that I will participate as long as the other 
party delivers, but a covenant states that I am committed to a 
person for life without performance demands. 
For these people divorce is not even an option.  This makes the 
proper selection of a life mate all the more critical and the 
need to go beyond physical attraction is apparent.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Marriage is an institution that defies those who want to promote 
the gender war.  A loving, caring marriage, and many still exist, 
is a beautiful reconciliation of a man and woman.  It develops 
good character in both parties.  It allows procreation and is the 
best environment for raising children.  They learn by example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians believe in marriage and they make it work.  In 1995, 
an average year, there were approximately 6.3 million married 
couples in Canada.  That year 98.8% of them decided it was worth 
it and stayed married.  A little over 1% got divorced but 98.8% 
said it was worth it and stayed married. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting in a recent Angus Reid poll on the state of 
the family in Canada that our young people also aspire to having 
stable marriages and families.  Some 93% of the youth in this 
poll predicted that their families would be the most important in 
their life and 80% of them believed that marriage was for life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party's position as of its most recent convention 
allows marriage to exclude one gender or other from the 
relationship and allows for two men to marry or two women to 
marry.  This is a contradiction to current Canadian law which 
repeatedly recognizes marriage as the voluntary union of a man 
and a woman, which by the way is exactly what the Reform Party 
membership has in its policy book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tragically, rather than bringing its position forward for public 
debate in the Parliament of Canada and to clarify the law, the 
justice minister chooses to defer to Liberal appointed judges to 
make changes independent of the will of the people of Canada. 
Increasingly judicial activism within the justice system is 
resulting in court rulings which are taking Canadian law in 
directions that are contradictory to the representative 
collective voice of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason it is a prudent step to further define marriage 
relationships in federal legislation.  I support Bill C-225.  Let 
me conclude by saying that for some this is a troubling topic, 
troubling in the fact that we are even seriously debating it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reassuring fact for me is that a man and a woman committed 
to intimate mutual care and a relationship for life to the 
exclusion of all others has been and will always be the most 
rewarding human relationship that they both can have, that the 
children can have, and for society.  This is the truth.  No 
matter how we want to play with the words, it will not change.

<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in this debate, but I am also a bit 
surprised. First of all, we should not forget that the 
conditions of a valid marriage are not an issue this Parliament 
should be dealing with. We should not suggest that the federal 
Parliament has anything to do with this issue. That is why I do 
not think the hon. member for Scarborough Southwest is 
addressing a pressing issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue we should take a stand on and debate in this House is 
whether we believe that two men or two women can really love 
each other and live with a certain set of values I share. 
Citizens who are taxpayers and concerned members of their 
communities deserve some recognition on the part of the 
legislator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But let us start at the beginning. We should take into 
consideration the fact that, in the next few weeks and months, 
various courts of law and administrative tribunals will render 
their decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A minute ago, I was quite proud to hear the hon. member for 
Scarborough Southwest quoting from my remarks. He said: “The 
hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve would like a debate in 
Parliament.” I agree. This debate should take place in 
Parliament. However, when I stated that position, I was speaking 
as the sponsor of a bill on the recognition of same sex couples.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let anyone give me a reason why two men or two women who freely 
engage in a consensual union—which is what we are talking about 
here—and want to spend the rest of their life together could 
not have some kind of institutional recognition of their union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For some, this institutional recognition will be marriage. For 
others, it will be a civil union contract. Throughout the world, 
dozens of countries allow two men or two women to have their 
commitment and their mutual obligations and responsibilities 
legally recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From what I see in the gay community, marriage is certainly not 
what the majority wants and certainly not the most pressing 
issue. What I see in the gay community, which is my community, 
are people, two men or two women, who live together, who support 
each other and who match perfectly the definition of spouse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In law, what are the three attributes that define the concept of 
spouse? I know there are distinguished lawyers in this House. 
There is one on my left and one on my right. I do not think I am 
mistaken when I say that, in law, the concept of spouse 
comprises three elements: cohabitation, common repute and, in 
certain cases, the presence of children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If two men or two women not only choose to engage in a union, to 
support each other and to share their daily existence but also 
define themselves as such within their community, let anyone 
give me one good reason why these people should not be 
recognized as a couple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should they be recognized as a couple? Because if we do not 
do it, we send two extremely negative messages to the public. 
First, we lead people to think that this type of commitment 
between two men or two women is less genuine, less noble, less 
worthy of respect that a commitment between a man and a woman, 
and this is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If some people here have doubts about that, why not consider 
the Nesbit-Egan couple, in British Columbia, who have shared 
their lives for more than 40 years. 
They have all the characteristics of a loving couple, active in 
their community and deserving of their peers' respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a second reason for recognizing same sex relationships. 
I remind this House that this is the true issue that we will 
have to deal with because, in the next few months, courts of law 
as well as administrative tribunals will be asking legislators 
to amend legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two men living together are citizens and taxpayers as well as 
consumers of services. If, as a member of parliament, I live 
with someone for two, three or four years and that I die, I 
would like anyone to give one good reason why my partner should 
not be entitled to a survivor's pension? 
Why should my partner not be entitled, when he goes to 
employment insurance, to a moving allowance? Why should he not 
be able to benefit from a registered retiring savings plan? Why 
should my partner be exposed to discrimination in the area of 
immigration? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are about 70 federal statutes giving a heterosexist 
definition of a spouse. I think we have the responsibility, as 
lawmakers, to ensure that we also have a homosexist view of the 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rather surprising to hear what the hon. member for 
Scarborough Southwest had to say. I do not question his good 
faith. However, I am surprised to hear that he is taking a 
strictly legalistic point of view.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the hon. member, when he replies, to tell us if, yes or 
no, he recognizes that two men or two women can live together, 
be attracted to one another and enter freely into a 
relationship. Because this is what it is all about. When someone 
is gay, when someone is a homosexual, no one forces that person 
to get involved in a relationship. There are, of course, people 
who do not get involved in such a relationship, who do not fully 
live up to their true nature, because of social pressure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member admit that it can be a great thing, a 
fulfilling and respectable thing for someone to live in a same 
sex relationship? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A law professor once told me that from a legal point of view, 
moral standards become outdated faster than anything else. As 
lawmakers, we cannot take a moral stance and say that something 
is good or something is wrong, that some people deserve our 
respect and others do not. As lawmakers, the issue we always 
have to keep sight of is discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is discrimination when lawmakers refuse to grant a 
category of citizens rights another category of citizens enjoy. 
And that is what happens when we refuse, as members of 
parliament, to recognize same sex spouses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real issue we will have to debate in the coming weeks will 
not be marriage but the recognition of same sex spouses. I will 
personally introduce a private member's bill providing for 
recognition of same sex spouses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard people say “If we attack the institution of marriage, if 
we refuse to believe that children must be raised by a man and a 
woman engaged in a strictly heterosexual relationship, we will 
undermine the institution of marriage, and not only will we 
undermine the institution of marriage, but we will, at the same 
time, undermine society”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we recognize that there are many different kinds of 
relationships? The speech by the member for Scarborough 
Southwest was certainly a moving appeal—I am not questioning 
his good faith—for the traditional family as we know it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the model the member is calling for, that is a man and 
a woman with children, is no longer the only and dominant model. 
There are many single parents who raise their children alone and 
who instil into them extremely respectable values. 
They are well adjusted and active in society and they deserve 
our respect as citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the member for Scarborough Southwest is raising 
an outdated issue we should not be debating in the House, 
because marriage falls under provincial jurisdiction. I believe 
we must put an end to discrimination and, for federal members of 
Parliament, this means we must recognize same sex spouses. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to congratulate the hon. member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve for his hard work on the recognition of 
the rights of same sex partners. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in Canada live in a country in which the highest court of the 
land, the constitution of our country and the charter of rights 
have affirmed that gay and lesbian people are to be treated with 
equality, with equal respect and dignity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That court has gone on to state that an essential element of 
that equality is recognition of the relationships of gay and 
lesbian people, that those relationships too are relationships 
and should not be treated with any kind of special rights or 
preference but with equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for that reason I rise in my place today to oppose the 
bill which has been put forward by the member for Scarborough 
Southwest.  He set out accurately the legal realities, the fact 
that there is no federal statute that governs the issue of 
capacity for marriage.  Yes, it is the courts that have ruled to 
date that two men or two women may not legally marry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member made reference to the eloquent dissent of the 
divisional court in Layland and Beaulne, but that remains a 
dissenting judgment.  He suggested that perhaps people were 
afraid of the debate.  Certainly I welcome the debate.  I do not 
think anyone is shirking this debate.  It is long overdue that we 
look at the nature of our relationships and how as a society we 
can sustain and affirm those relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly I had not intended to propose a bill on this subject. 
The member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve is quite right.  There is 
considerable debate even within the gay and lesbian community 
about the priority which should be attached to the work toward 
recognition of gay and lesbian marriages.  The fundamental issue 
is recognition of our right to equality across the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that in acknowledging the importance of this as a 
choice, which is what it should be recognized as, for those gay 
and lesbian couples who wish to enter into it I do not believe 
federal law should deny that option.  For that reason I have 
tabled a bill which would also amend the federal legislation and 
which would state that a marriage between two persons is not 
invalid by reason only that they are of the same sex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In introducing that bill on March 25 of this year I stated that 
I believed our relationships should be celebrated and affirmed as 
just as loving, just as committed, just as strong as heterosexual 
relationships, and that federal statutes should reflect that 
equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Scarborough Southwest suggested that the concept 
of marriage was under attack.  I would question whether the 
institution of marriage is so fragile and so threatened that 
allowing gay and lesbian people who seek access to this 
institution would somehow cause it to come crumbling down. I do 
not believe that.  I do not believe it would destroy it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard from the Reform member for Calgary Centre that one 
of the essential elements of marriage is procreation.  How does 
he respond to an article in yesterday's Toronto <I>Sun</I>?  It is 
a story about Karl Thompson, age 92, who slipped a gold band on 
the finger of Yvon Geoffrey, 84 years old, and said “We never 
thought it would develop into this”.  Loving companionship is 
what it is.  They met during a bingo game six years previously. 
His granddaughter Michelle said “They are so much in love it is 
unbelievable.  It makes you feel all warm and fuzzy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>God forbid, a 92 year old him and a 84 year old her and no 
children, no procreation, is not a real marriage. Damn it, that 
is wrong.  What defines a marriage and what should define a 
marriage is love, caring, compassion and a commitment for better 
or for worse, for richer or poorer, to one's partner. That is 
what should define it and that is what federal legislation should 
allow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been changes in the law.  In Holland the new 
government announced that it intends to move forward.  It said 
that in the interest of strengthening the equal treatment of 
homosexual and lesbian couples the cabinet would this year 
introduce a bill to open civil marriage to persons of the same 
sex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of South Africa has announced that it intends to 
take the same step.  We heard from this podium President Nelson 
Mandela speaking of the importance of equality.  I am very proud 
of the fact that Canada is one of the only countries in the 
world, along with South Africa, that in its constitution 
recognizes and celebrates the equality of all citizens including 
those of us who are gay or lesbian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes people do not understand the human dimension of our 
relationships.  My colleague from Hochelaga—Maisonneuve spoke 
about Jim Egan and Jack Nesbit who this year are celebrating 50 
years together in a committed and loving relationship.  Why on 
earth should they, or others in their situation who are embarking 
on that lifelong journey together, be denied the affirmation of 
marriage if they seek that affirmation?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could talk at some length about my own relationship.  I spoke 
earlier this year about the extent to which my relationship with 
my partner, Max, was for me truly life sustaining at a very 
difficult and painful time after a life threatening accident. I 
spoke as well about the fact that he sustained me as a caregiver 
during some very tough and difficult times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that relationship is not recognized as just as loving, just 
as compassionate and for me and my partner just as meaningful and 
strong, why not?  Why should we not be allowed to celebrate that 
relationship before our families, our friends, our loved ones, in 
a marriage if we choose to do so?  The member for Scarborough 
Southwest would say no, that option is not one that should be 
open to us.  It threatens the concept of marriage.  I do not 
believe it does any such thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tragically that too many Canadians have only come to fully 
understand the relationships of gay people during the epidemic of 
AIDS.  Time and time again I have personally witnessed the 
tremendous love, compassion and caregiving those who are living 
with a person with HIV or AIDS have experienced.  I know members 
will be able to share these stories.  Those are traditional 
family values that we should celebrate and affirm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been significant progress in the recognition of our 
relationships.  In a number of jurisdictions there has been 
movement on pensions, on recognition of rights and 
responsibilities when a relationship breaks down, and on 
adoption.  However much work remains to be done in the areas of 
immigration and pensions.  There is still a lot of work in a 
number of other areas of federal jurisdiction before there is 
full equality and justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that parliament send a signal to all Canadian 
citizens that we are not threatened by diversity but that we 
celebrate diversity and that part of that magnificent diversity 
in our Canadian society is a recognition of the families and the 
partnerships of gay and lesbian people.  I believe those 
partnerships should be recognized in marriage if that is the 
choice of the people involved.  I believe federal law should 
allow that.  For that reason I rise in opposition to the bill 
before the House today.

the Marriage (Prohibited Degrees) Act and the Interpretation Act, 
put forward by the hon. member opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned by numerous previous speakers, the purpose of the

between one unmarried man and one unmarried woman.  This is a 
strict legal definition.  As with all legal semantics there is a 
broad range of interpretation.  Social mores and marital 
convention are perhaps even more complex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the hon. member for Scarborough Southwest for 
bringing forward the legislation.  It fosters a healthy debate 
within the Chamber, one that many feel needs to be pursued 
actively by Canadians from coast to coast.  In my view the 
legislation crosses traditional party lines, extends beyond the 
elected representatives in this place, and needs to be examined 
by society as a whole.  By its very nature the bill is personal 
and leads to as many opinions as the persons prepared to voice 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While members of parliament may stand today in the House of 
Commons and loudly and proudly proclaim their parties' positions 
on what constitutes marriage in the legal sense, I would venture 
a guess that these opinions are not representative of their 
entire parties or even of their entire caucuses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the Reform Party has offered the definition of marriage 
as referred to in Bill C-225 as being that of between a man and a 
woman, that definition was in relation to proposed fiscal reforms 
and not in relation to amendments to the Marriage Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps there will come a time in the House in which all 
members, regardless of political affiliation,  will be able to 
express themselves on a legislative measure similar to the one 
proposed in Bill C-225.  That time however is not here. 
With a private member's bill there has not been full debate, 
particularly amongst the Canadian public at large.  Before such a 
debate occurs in public it must occur in society.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a larger public venue for as many Canadians and members 
of parliament as possible to take part in the debate.  We need to 
be circumspect, tolerant and measured when approaching issues of 
human relations.  Perhaps the venue should be through a 
legislative committee or a royal commission.  Having said that, I 
do not profess to offer the position of the Progressive 
Conservative Party with respect to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill reflects a moral question.  It is one which each and 
every Canadian needs to reflect upon and ask themselves what they 
consider to be a married couple.  It needs to be fully debated in 
a forum in which all Canadians may participate and voice their 
opinions, regardless of political affiliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are demanding less rigid partisanship and I feel this 
legislation is a prime opportunity for members and the Canadian 
public as a whole to demonstrate such willingness for change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally I do not see how Bill C-225 would improve the social 
and economic condition of Canadians.  Although Statistics Canada 
points to the growing number of common law relationships and 
single parent families, will Bill C-225 change this reality of 
Canadian life? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not agree more that strong parental role models are 
needed and are crucial to the development of the child.  Sadly 
this is not the case throughout the country.  I hasten to add 
that more often than not good role models are becoming a rare 
commodity in our communities.  If parliament passed a law such as 
Bill C-225 I would seriously doubt as to whether it would result 
in increased marriages between men and women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-225 operates under the same assumption as the Liberal 
government's firearms act and the recent amendments; namely, that 
legislation will automatically result in a change hoped for by 
its proponents.  It is a false hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What evidence does the hon. member for Scarborough Southwest or 
any other member have that would support this contention?  How 
would Canadians benefit from this legislation?  It begs the 
question:  What priority should it be given at this time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk less about legislation and more about real people 
and real families.  Let us talk about a young couple, recently 
married, both with huge student loans.  The wife is expecting a 
child and would like to stay home and away from professional 
life.  Yet this couple cannot afford to sacrifice the wife's 
income so she can remain at home to care for her child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is of a husband and wife married for 10 or more 
years with two children.  The husband is unemployed and unable to 
find work.  The wife has taken a minimum wage job to support the 
family, thus taking her away from the family.  They are 
struggling to make ends meet and the entire family will suffer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changing the Marriage Act will not impact on those scenarios one 
iota.  It would not improve the conditions for those families. 
It would not improve the conditions for the couples and it 
certainly would not improve the conditions for the children.  I 
challenge anyone to state otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to propose another series of measures which would 
improve the quality of life for Canadian families, be they in the 
traditional role espoused by many in society or be they part of 
the growing trend toward new types of families, such as single 
parents and common law couples.  We need to be talking less about 
amending federal statutes and more about choices that the federal 
government is making with respect to Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us focus our time as parliamentarians on reducing the tax 
burden for Canadians instead of spending more time on amending 
the Marriage Act.  Let us urge the government to increase the 
basic income tax exemption from $6,456 to $10,000 a year.  This 
measure would take two million lower income workers off the tax 
rolls and save money for every single Canadian taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us urge the government to cut employment insurance premiums 
to remove the largest single barrier to job creation in Canada 
today or urge the government to reduce the tax credit of up to 
17% interest on student loans.  Let us increase annual RRSP 
contributions which are limited now and change the rules so that 
low and middle income workers can save more money by purchasing 
RRSPs, or make the $4,000 registered education savings plan, the 
RESP contribution, tax deductible and allow part of the current 
RRSPs to be transferred without a penalty to RESPs.  Let us spend 
our time as parliamentarians identifying cost effective and 
fiscally responsible ways to index the child tax benefit as 
proposed by my caucus colleague, the hon. member for Shefford.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us spend our time and effort urging the government to devote 
more resources to early intervention programs to prevent youth 
crime before it occurs.  The Minister of Justice has already 
admitted that the level of support in her government for early 
intervention is currently embarrassing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a shocking miscalculation of priorities that emanates 
from the government side of the House.  Let us spend time 
highlighting the fact that the federal government only covers 30% 
of the cost of enforcing the Young Offenders Act, yet it will not 
listen to the provinces when they tell the Minister of Justice 
that her proposals are currently too weak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us do more than just talk abut the threat of organized crime 
in this country and talk about how we can improve the peaceful 
existence of Canadians.  Those are tangible, positive initiatives 
to truly strengthen Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian family needs support.  It is under tremendous 
pressure as to how it reacts as an institution to this pressure 
and it will determine the course that this country takes in the 
next generation.  Canada's parliament needs to take decisive 
action to nurture our families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In no way do I want to detract from the efforts or the motives 
of the hon. member for Scarborough Southwest, yet I am left to 
ask the same question repeatedly.  What is the government doing 
to improve the situation for Canadian families as they currently 
exist?  Will more young mothers and fathers be able to choose to 
stay at home and care for their children because the Marriage Act 
has been amended?  I do not think so.  Will there be more 
economic opportunities or employment opportunities as a result of 
these amendments?  Again I would say no.  Will we have fewer 
divorces or fewer child behavioural problems resulting from the 
proposed amendments?  I do not believe so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me the answer comes from my constituents, those families who 
work hard, get by with less and live a reduced quality of life. 
They are the backbone of Canadian society.  It is truly 
heartbreaking when an elected official gets visits, telephone 
calls and letters from constituents who are having trouble 
because of no fault of their own, trying to raise their family 
and trying to make ends meet.  Not once have I heard someone come 
forward and ask me to change the Marriage Act.  That is not the 
key to the solutions for the problems facing Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As but one of 301 members of this House, I would therefore 
suggest that we establish a public forum, either a legislative 
subcommittee or a royal commission, to allow Canadians to express 
their collective opinion on this subject if it is deemed 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would be consistent with the approach that was taken by 
parliament in reviewing the Divorce Act through a special joint 
committee on child custody and access.  Canadians need to hold 
open, vigorous and energetic debate on the amendments to the 
Marriage Act before parliament does so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, parliament has a responsibility and an 
obligation to Canadians to focus its time and resources on issues 
of priority. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
in two minutes I can barely address this subject of great 
importance.  I want to say right from the very outset that I 
think this is just the beginning of a discussion.  I do not agree 
in any way, shape or form with the proposal put forward by my 
colleague, although I respect his right to that point of view.  I 
can see that there is a place for religious, spiritual and moral 
approaches from his perspective, but I see the role and 
relationship of the state in an entirely different light. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the relationship of mutual obligation based on 
partnership is absolutely fundamental.  I think to bring in 
legislation in terms of lives in modern day society, and never 
mind 1866, is a contemporary pursuit that is absolutely 
necessary, where the principle of equality of both parties and 
the right to the division of assets on an equal basis, the right 
to benefits on an equal basis, the right to share that 
companionship and that mutual support and respect has nothing to 
do with gender politics and gender issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From my perspective I can tell members that discrimination based 
on sexual orientation is wrong.  Discrimination where we cannot 
have a distribution of benefits equally among partners, whether 
they are two males, two females or a man and a woman, is wrong. I 
believe we have to have equal distribution of benefits and equal 
rights.  It should apply equally to common law couples and to 
couples who are looking after each other in a loving 
relationship.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would love to have further used the definition of the family 
by the Vanier Institute.  I would have liked to quote the Prime 
Minister who has a very strong point of view.  I would have liked 
to tell the House what we are doing at the provincial level which 
will result in very uneven decisions across the land or about 
what has been said in the supreme courts of the country.  I 
cannot, but they all agree with what I have just said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The last five 
minutes goes to the hon. member for Scarborough Southwest in 
whose name the bill stands. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in this brief time we have had an opportunity to see the 
beginnings of the kind of debate we should be having in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard some good speeches.  We heard some speeches with 
different points of view.  This should not be the end.  This 
should be the beginning.  Unfortunately it will be the end 
because when I am finished speaking this bill is dead for all 
intents and purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some speakers missed some of the points.  For example, the hon. 
member for Burnaby—Douglas said that no one is shirking the 
debate.  No one in here is shirking the debate because we are all 
here debating.  However one of the stated reasons of the justice 
department for opposing the bill is that it risks opening further 
debate, particularly if referred to committee. The Department of 
Justice is shirking the debate, not members of parliament in the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some speakers want to redefine marriage.  I remind members that 
the position of the federal government, the position of the 
Government of Canada, the position of the minister, is that the 
law I quoted at the beginning is the law of Canada.  The 
Department of Justice will continue to defend that law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am trying to put that in statutory form so that the judges of 
the country can see that the people of the country, as 
represented by their members of parliament, have spoken and give 
them guidance on the position of the government.  Marriage is the 
voluntary union between one man and one woman who are not 
otherwise married.  In fact that is what the majority of people 
believe a marriage should be.  We are not talking about benefits. 
We are not talking about pensions.  We are talking about the 
concept of marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve says that we cannot take a 
moral viewpoint in legislation.  I could not disagree more. 
Everything we do in this place has a moral foundation to it, 
depending on how we were raised and how we look at things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talks about my taking a legalistic point of view.  What do we 
do in this place?  We pass laws.  We control or try to control 
the lives of people based on the laws we pass in this place. Each 
and every one of us brings a set of moral guidelines which they 
consciously or subconsciously apply to every piece of 
legislation, whether it is gun control, tobacco restriction, 
tobacco advertising restriction, control of gangs and gang 
related activity, or the Criminal Code of Canada in which every 
sentence has a moral aspect.  It is a complete code of what one 
must or must not do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve also said that the 
celebration of marriage was a provincial matter.  That is 
completely incorrect in law.  We have a federal Divorce Act.  The 
reason for that is that marriage, the capacity to marry, is dealt 
with federally.  It is up to the federal government to decide who 
can or cannot marry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend asked whether two people could live together freely. 
Of course they can.  Many people live together:  brothers and 
sisters, uncles and aunts, lesbian and gay couples, but that does 
not make them entitled to marry as we have known it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to allow other types of relationships we will have to 
open it up to all kinds of relationships, and that is not a 
debate to take place in a courtroom.  That is a debate to take 
place here because it is up to society to decide what 
relationships will be recognized as a marriage.  It is not up to 
the courts.

this bill is trying to do is enshrine in statute that which is 
currently the government's position, which is that there is no 
capacity to marry unless there is a male and a female. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, as this is Private Members' Business this matter

<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the dictionary defines competition as a rivalry between two or 
more businesses striving for the same customer or market. 
Accordingly if the Royal Canadian Mint carries through on its 
threat to borrow $30 million on the taxpayers' good credit rating 
and begins its risky venture into the coin blank market, it will 
become a competitor of Westaim Corporation from Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Westaim is a successful Canadian business with 110 employees in 
its coin plating division.  For 35 years it has supplied coin 
blanks to the Canadian mint as well as to mints in countries 
around the world. However, in keeping with the government slogan 
that no good deed goes unpunished, the Liberals have decided to 
put this company out of business and its employees out of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the first time the Liberals have interfered in a 
successful Canadian industry.  In the 1970s the Liberal 
government of the day moved into the oil industry by purchasing 
Petrofina and setting up an intrusive national energy program. 
That brilliant scheme cost jobs, damaged the oil industry and 
wasted millions of precious taxpayers' dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why can this government not butt out and let the private sector 
take care of itself?  Small and medium size businesses are the 
backbone of our Canadian economy.  Throwing away money may be 
something this government has perfected, but putting companies 
out of business is going a little too far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Experts from the South African and Birmingham mints have 
estimated that there is currently a 30% to 40% oversupply in the 
world coin blank market.  They have predicted a reduction in 
demand in the near future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are using cash and coins less and less.  Why? 
Increasingly we are all using our bank cards, credit cards and in 
the very near future we will begin using electronic cash cards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not want the government to be getting into the coin 
blank business now any more than I would have wanted it to get 
into the horse drawn buggy business in the 1900s.  This venture 
would put the government into a start-up business in a sunset 
industry when there is already a saturated market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only two outcomes are possible, neither of which are desirable. 
Either the mint will bury Westaim and put its 110 workers on the 
unemployment lines, or the mint's new business will go down in 
flames and taxpayers will be on the hook for a minimum of $30 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six months ago the mint started construction on its new coin 
plating plant, yet the minister does not have the authority of 
parliament to spend this money.  Furthermore, the mint does not 
have the legal right to use the manufacturing process necessary 
to make coin blanks.  Westaim owns the patent on this softening 
process and still has an unresolved lawsuit against the Royal 
Canadian Mint.

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a government owned crown corporation, the mint could have 
used the patent if it had bought a licence, but it did not.  As a 
result, the mint cannot legally manufacture coin blanks with this 
process and it is tied up in a lawsuit that might scuttle the 
entire project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I have two questions.  How can the minister 
arrogantly risk taxpayers' dollars on a project that might never 
see the light of day?  If this matter is before the courts, why 
is the minister allowing the construction of the coin plating 
plant to continue? 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
mint's mandate is to supply Canadians with coins that are of high 
quality, cost effective and delivered on time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a commercial entity, the mint generates a financial return to 
the Government of Canada by successfully marketing its minting 
services and coinage products worldwide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In early April the mint began construction of a new coin plating 
facility in Winnipeg which will fulfil three objectives.  It will 
guarantee a cost effective supply of plated domestic coinage; 
produce annual savings of approximately $10 million; and generate 
additional profits of $3 million annually from the production of 
foreign plated coinage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mint obtained the funds to build the plating facility from a 
private commercial institution, not from the government.  The 
mint does not receive any government subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current Royal Canadian Mint Act, the mint may borrow 
up to $50 million from the consolidated revenue fund or any other 
source.  Members may recall that in May the government introduced 
Bill C-41, an act to amend the Royal Canadian Mint Act and the 
Currency Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the amendments proposes increasing the mint's borrowing 
limit to $75 million.  This is not because the mint needs 
additional money to finance the plating facility.  It has already 
obtained the financing it requires. The proposed increase will 
allow the mint to maintain a borrowing cushion or margin of 
safety as growth occurs in the years ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mint's competition is not with Westaim, not with private 
industry, but rather with foreign government mints.  Some 
countries will only contract from government mint to government 
mint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mint's investments in its plating plant, its workforce and 
its new technology will ensure that it is well placed to be a 
leader in the global market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that this clarifies once and for all the mint's 
mandate, its operations and the financing for its new plating 
facility.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
June 26, the Minister of Human Resources Development announced a 
regular POWA for the former workers of the BC Mine in Black 
Lake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet a month before, he said in this House that these workers did 
not want a regular POWA because such a program was in unfair for 
workers. The minister got the message very clearly on June 26, 
when he announced the granting of a regular POWA, in Thetford 
Mines, because the workers made their disappointment clear, in 
no uncertain terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the elected member for Frontenac—Megantic and representative 
of the workers of the BC Mine, I am asking two things from the 
Minister of Human Resources Development. First that he not use 
the extra $1.6 million that Jean Dupéré contributed to the fund 
for the calculation of his regular POWA. Second that he accept 
to sit down with Minister Louise Harel, of the Government of 
Quebec, and the president of the CSN, André Laliberté, in order 
to resolve the issue and destandardize his POWA with the $1.6 
million from Jean Dupéré. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I want to remind the minister that many of the 
former workers at the BC mine have used up their employment 
insurance benefits, that the mine has been closed for almost a 
year, that older workers have difficulty finding a new job, that 
many of them are now in dire straits, that he and his government 
are standing in the way of any agreement that could lead to a 
satisfactory and quick settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development is the only one 
responsible for delays in the settlement for the workers at the 
BC mine. These men are anxious to live with security and 
decency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do hope that the Minister of Human Resources Development will 
soon have good news for the former workers of the BC mine in 
Black Lake.

re-enter the labour market.  Our active measures include targeted 
wage subsidies, self-employment assistance and skills 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance in this case between 60 and 70 workers have found 
work at one of the other two mines run by Lab Chrysotile, the 
Bell mine or Lac d'Amiante du Canada. Approximately 60 others are 
interested in taking courses, 30 of whom are presently enrolled, 
with the other 30 starting in October.  Seventeen have been 
placed by the Comité d'aide aux travailleurs de la mine B.C. 
through targeted wage subsidies. Three have started their own 
businesses, with another three being reviewed for possible 
funding.  That is the first $3 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last June the HRD minister also announced $1 million in funding 
under the program for older workers adjustment intended to help 
workers between 55 and 64 years of age.  This measure will assist 
about 100 workers whose employment insurance benefits will soon 
be running out.  But the provincial government has still not 
agreed to sign the POWA agreement to help these older workers. We 
hope that the Government of Quebec will respond positively and 
quickly so that we can begin to put these dollars in the hands of 
the 100 former miners who qualify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has responded responsibly to the 
British Canadian mine workers.  We have put forward $4 million 
and a variety of programs to assist these Canadians through a 
difficult time.
