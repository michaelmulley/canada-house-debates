	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the measure of a society is 
based on how it includes all of its members in an active manner and 
how it allows them to participate as fully as possible in life.
<P>
	Government, communities and individuals must recognize the 
important role they have to play in addressing the needs of 
Canadians with disabilities. The issues facing them are not theirs 
alone.
<P>
	The Government of Canada has traditionally taken a leadership 
role in addressing the interests of persons with disabilities. My 
department offers an array of programs and services geared to 
providing the support necessary to allow persons with disabilities 
to live and work with dignity and as independently as possible.
<P>
	We all have a shared responsibility, all levels of government, all 
political parties and all Canadians, for providing positive 
assistance to enable persons with disabilities to participate in the 
mainstream of society as full and equal citizens.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The contribution of persons with disabilities is a valuable one 
and as a government it is inherent upon us to do our utmost so that 
they are never excluded from our society. The loss to Canada would 
be too great.
<P>
	Together, the federal, provincial and territorial governments, as 
well as communities, must look at how best to develop and deliver 
the programs and services that ensure voices of people with 
disabilities will always be heard.
<P>
	Last Wednesday, I took part in the federal-provincial-territorial 
council on social policy renewal. It was a great day for all 
Canadians. For we witnessed a new spirit of collaboration between 
levels of government.
<P>
	In that room, ministers and representatives from across our 
country identified Canadians with disabilities as one of our key 
priorities.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I assure members the ministerial council is seeking practical and 
concrete ways to meet their needs. Through this environment of 
trust, openness and mutual respect, we will be able to work in 
partnership to develop measures that will improve programs and 
services for persons with disabilities.
<P>
	My federal, provincial and territorial colleagues are committed 
to working together to harmonize our approaches to better serve the 
needs of Canadians with disabilities. Federal, provincial and 
territorial working groups are looking at various options that we 
can bring back to first ministers in the coming months.
<P>
	The task force on disability issues, chaired by the member for 
Fredericton-York-Sunbury, is another valuable contribution on 
which we can build. It provides the Government of Canada with 
some valuable information and direction for its activities as well as 
those it undertakes in partnership with other levels of government.
<P>
	I am looking forward to developing some substantial measures 
in collaboration with my federal, provincial and territorial 
colleagues in response to the issues identified in the task force 
report.
<P>
	I am continuing to discuss with my cabinet colleagues actions 
we can take in collaboration with provinces and the disability 
community to meet the needs of Canadians with disabilities. 
Progress is being made on a continuous basis.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canada can play a leading role in the international community to 
ensure that the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6998"> 6998 </A></B>
<P>
will be met. We have made great strides in the past few years, but 
we all recognize that much more must be done.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity, on this 
International Day of Disabled Persons and in what is known as the 
Week of Disabled Persons in Quebec, proclaimed for the first time 
this year, to pay tribute to disabled persons across the country who, 
faced daily with their disabilities, need tremendous courage not 
only to overcome these disabilities but also to overcome the 
barriers facing them in their personal and professional lives and in 
their social activities.
<P>
	I also wish to pay tribute to the families who are responsible for 
their care. Families take on these responsibilities in sometimes 
difficult circumstances and in many cases have to face the same 
restrictions as the individuals for whose care they are responsible, 
which may be an emotionally draining experience.
<P>
	Finally, I would also like to pay tribute to the volunteers who are 
active in all kinds of organizations to support and promote the 
rights of disabled persons so that our society will become more 
open in this respect, and who also provide better services at a time 
when most, if not all governments are reducing their involvement 
in this area.
<P>
	When I heard the Minister of Human Resources Development 
make a speech which basically only paid lip service to a number of 
principles, I was disappointed, but I also consider this further proof 
of this government's contempt for the disabled.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pettigrew:</B> Oh, come on!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> I suggest 
that the minister take a deep breath and listen to what I have to say. 
I have worked with disabled persons for many years, and I do not 
need any advice from a political upstart who does not do his 
homework and does not know what he is talking about.
<P>
	To prove this, I have two documents that I suggest he read 
carefully. The first one is the report of the human rights committee, 
tabled in this House in 1995. The report was unanimous, in other 
words, it had the support of the members of this government and 
the members of the official opposition.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I see the minister-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order.
<P>
	I am sorry to interrupt my hon. colleague, but everyone here in 
this House saw the Minister of Human Resources Development 
give the finger to the member who was speaking. This kind of 
behaviour is entirely unacceptable, especially since the subject he 
is discussing, persons with disabilities, deserves all due respect.
<P>
	I hope the minister will apologize and there will be no more 
incidents like this one when we are discussing such a serious topic.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
I think the minister's gesture only discredits the minister and 
underscores the lack of substance in his message and his failure to 
act in this area.
<P>
	I shall, if I may, get back to the subject of my speech. I said the 
minister should read the 1995 report of the human rights committee 
tabled in this House a year ago in December. This unanimous 
report was endorsed by the members of his party, the government 
party, by the members of the opposition and the members of the 
Reform Party. It provided a concrete response to the demands of 
persons with disabilities.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	Almost a year later, his predecessor decided to use taxpayers' 
money to set up a partisan committee, which fortunately was joined 
by representatives of groups of people with disabilities from all 
across Canada. This committee tabled its report in October. Here is 
what the Liberal group, the minister's group, said in the first few 
pages of its report, which the minister has not read-as his 
comments clearly show. The report says: ``While their arguments 
have been listened to at the political level and by governments, 
there has been a growing gap between saying and doing''.
<P>
	A little further along, the report states: ``At the federal level'', 
this is the Liberals talking, ``responses to the report tabled by the 
human rights committee in 1995 have been equivocal and in some 
cases non-existent''. The response to the framework document, the 
latest report of the Standing Committee on Human Rights and the 
Status of Persons with Disabilities intimated that the status quo was 
good enough. This is the government's response.
<P>
	And what do they have to say? All puffed up today, the day of 
persons with disabilities, the minister offers us six or seven pages 
worth of his desire for governments, various provinces and various 
departments to co-operate. People with disabilities do not want 
co-operation, they want action, they want constructive action.
<P>
	No one is expecting the minister to introduce measures during 
the election campaign or in version two of the red book; they want 
action now. However-and I will close on this-the minister's 
response appears on the first page. You have to read between the 
lines. On the first page, the minister says: ``The measure of a 
society is based on how it includes all of its members in an active 
manner-''. Fine lip service. The paragraph concludes: ``The 
issues facing them'', people with disabilities, ``are not theirs 
alone''. That is the government's response. In other words, line up 
and, when your turn comes along, maybe we will attend to you, if 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6999"> 6999 </A></B>
<P>
we have the time. This is not how the official opposition sees things  
and this is not what we are going to defend in the weeks to come.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a privilege to speak today on behalf of my party, the 
Reform Party, on this international day to recognize persons with 
disabilities, particularly in Canada.
<P>
	Many Canadians with disabilities face many unique challenges 
each day of their lives. Even in Canada where many external 
changes have been made to facilitate life for persons with 
disabilities it takes a level of courage for persons with disabilities 
to accomplish many of the tasks that other Canadians too often take 
for granted.
<P>
	Today I pause as I talk about a faceless mask called persons with 
disabilities because, as is the case with all Canadians, each of these 
people with disabilities is unique, and each one has their own 
disability with its own individual challenges.
<P>
	When developing public policy we typically talk only about a 
group of people called persons with disabilities. In that it is too 
easy to develop one program or one system which is supposed to 
help that faceless group which has been classified as disabled 
rather than recognizing the uniqueness of each person's 
circumstance.
<P>
	Unfortunately this appears to be the way Ottawa has treated 
persons with disabilities for decades. It is hardly surprising that a 
recent report released by the federal task force on disability issues 
discovered a high level of frustration and some anger among 
persons with disabilities in Canada.
<P>
	Lately we have heard the needs of the disabled are being 
addressed as a priority in the deliberations of the 
federal-provincial-territorial council on social policy renewal. I 
believe the needs of disabled persons are far more likely to be met 
by provinces or levels closer to those individuals that can tailor 
those services more specifically to the needs of those citizens.
<P>
	The direction for the solutions for the disabled should be in the 
hands of provinces or levels even lower than that. The control of 
and the decisions on these important issues should be made as close 
to the people as possible to avoid the duplication of bureaucratic 
costs, needless costs which we too often see in this place.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	We need to empower communities. We need to empower 
families in order that they may address the uniqueness of the 
disability and of the individual.
<P>
	Not so long ago in this House we voted on a private member's 
motion, Motion No. 30. That motion stated that the government 
should consider amending the Income Tax Act to provide a 
caregiver tax credit for those who provide care in the home for 
preschool children and the disabled. That motion looked to the 
specific needs of the disabled in order to empower the family 
looking after the disabled person, which in turn would empower 
that individual. Unfortunately, the front benches of the government 
rejected that motion outright. The government said that was not in 
its plans.
<P>
	This government refuses to leave money in the hands of the 
people who can use it with the greatest wisdom. The government 
continues to believe that it has the solutions for the problems in the 
homes of this country and for the challenges which disabled people 
face. I disagree with the government, which feels that all solutions 
in this nation must come from Ottawa and all solutions must be 
determined by bureaucracy.
<P>
	Typically, Ottawa is the source of well intentioned programs, in 
most cases, but it has the mindset that it is only the federal 
government which can solve problems. Typically the programs are 
pulled in a myriad of directions and at the end of the day most 
programs that are developed lack a substantive review to actually 
determine if they work. The purpose is too often fuzzy to start with, 
too influenced by short term demand, perhaps an election call, or 
perhaps it is a program which reflects the flavour of the month for 
social programs.
<P>
	We saw that in the development of the Canada pension plan, 
which was originally designed to give security to Canadians. That 
plan has led to untold frustration for the disabled people who must 
apply for it. It has placed an expense on a public system, which was 
not originally intended. Again it is an example of a program that 
has not worked as originally intended. Perhaps governments did 
not think through the plan and address their real intention.
<P>
	Government does not solve the problems. Individual Canadians 
must be allowed to address these problems with a level of support 
which is closest to their needs.
<P>
	The report that was mentioned earlier was called ``A Will to 
Act''. My hon. colleague in the official opposition mentioned his 
frustration. I would like to mention my frustration that too often 
Ottawa acts without achieving the desired results. It is too willing 
to act without proper evaluation and the end result does not reflect 
the original intention.
<P>
	What we need for all Canadians is the will to succeed. We must 
find the solutions. I believe those solutions are best found not in 
this place but in the decisions which are made by individual 
Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.)</B> moved for leave

<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, the national census requires Canadians to 
include their personal names and addresses on census documents in 
part so that if they make a wrong or an incomplete statement on the 
census form they can be prosecuted by the government.
<P>
	I believe this requirement carries with it an unwarranted distrust 
of Canadians. Also, since census documents are not anonymous, 
many respondents are not completely forthcoming with all the 
information. They feel that if their name is attached to it someone 
is going to know their history, their income and everything about 
them that the census takes in as information.
<P>
	I believe that the information gathered may not be as reliable as 
it would be in a non-traceable document. I believe there is no good 
reason for the government to have such detailed personal 
information about each individual Canadian. Therefore this private 
member's bill would amend the Statistics Act to ensure that 
Canadians would be able to participate anonymously in the 
national census. This would lead to both a less intrusive 
government and a more accurate census.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EXCISETAXACT">EXCISE TAX ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (for Minister of Finance, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-70, an act to amend the Excise Tax Act, the 
Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act, the Income Tax Act, 
the Debt Servicing and Reduction Account Act and related acts, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to lead off second 
reading of important and historic legislation, the introduction of a 
new harmonized sales tax, or HST, throughout most of Atlantic 
Canada. With the inauguration of the HST we have begun a process 
for replacing the GST and providing all Canadians with a better 
sales tax system.
<P>
	Today's legislation will enable the federal government and the 
provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland and 
Labrador to introduce a new harmonized tax effective April 1, 
1997. But as the benefits of the HST become clear and concrete, 
benefits for consumers, for businesses and for the economy as a 
whole, I am confident that other provinces will put the interests of 
consumers first and sign on to the HST.
<P>
	This is extensive legislation covering as it must changes to the 
Excise Tax Act, the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act 
and the Income Tax Act and related acts. In my remarks today I 
want to highlight the key elements of the HST and to remind this 
House why these are important and positive steps forward.
<P>
	When the current government came to power we said: ``A 
Liberal government will replace the GST with a system that 
generates equivalent revenues, is fairer to consumers and to small 
business, minimizes disruption to small business, and promotes 
federal-provincial co-operation and harmonization''. These then 
were the principles that guided us as we examined all the options 
for replacing the GST: fairness; equivalent revenues; 
federal-provincial co-operation and harmonization; and 
simplification.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The new government followed through with its election promise. 
As members might recall, the process to replace the GST was 
initiated immediately following the election.
<P>
	In fact, it is at that time that we asked the House Standing 
Committee on Finance to look into every possible alternative to 
replace the GST and to consult Canadians on the various options.
<P>
	The committee heard close to 500 witnesses, namely tax experts, 
business people and consumers from across Canada, and received 
over 700 briefs.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	After reviewing 20 different options, committee members came 
to the conclusion that a large majority favoured harmonization, that 
is replacing the current mosaic of federal and provincial sales taxes 
with a single value added tax.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Finance made four key 
recommendations. First, it came down in favour of a value added 
tax. Second, it recommended harmonizing the federal GST and 
provincial retail sales taxes without delay. Third, it recommended 
streamlining the tax. And last, it recognized the importance of 
including the tax in the price, so that the price consumers see on the 
shelf is what they pay at the cash.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Finance looked closely into the 
economic impact of the proposals it received as well as their 
acceptability to businesses and consumers across Canada. What is 
more, the committee's recommendations were entirely in keeping 
with the government's red book commitments.
<P>
	That is why we are actively promoting the implementation of a 
new tax based on harmonization with the provinces as the best 
alternative to the GST.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7002"> 7002 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	To help smooth the way for harmonization and make the 
harmonized tax as simple and fair as possible, we put together a 
major package of streamlining initiatives. These initiatives will 
help to fulfil the recommendation of the finance committee and the 
commitment of the red book to a simpler sales tax system.
<P>
	The streamlining package includes over 100 measures. Many of 
them are technical and sector specific. Quite a few have been 
recognized as major positive changes for the many sectors they will 
affect. The proposed changes include new and simpler rules for 
many areas of the GST, for example for charities and non-profit 
organizations, for employee benefits, health care and used goods.
<P>
	Since the streamlining package was announced last April, the 
federal government also announced on October 23 a 100 per cent 
rebate for the GST or the federal portion of the HST on books 
purchased by a broad range of educational institutions and public 
sector bodies across Canada. This reflects this government's firm 
commitment to supporting literacy in as cost effective and fiscally 
responsible manner as possible.
<P>
	In short the streamlining changes will help to make the 
harmonized tax a better tax and improve the operation of the GST 
in the non-participating provinces.
<P>
	At the same time that we announced this package, we also 
announced that a memorandum of understanding on a harmonized 
sales tax had been reached with the three participating provinces. 
Taken together this signalled the inauguration of a process for 
harmonization, one under which provinces can come on board with 
the HST as they are ready. Subsequently on October 23, the 
governments of Canada, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and 
Newfoundland and Labrador announced detailed agreements to 
replace the GST and the provincial retail sales taxes in the three 
Atlantic provinces with a harmonized sales tax.
<P>
	The new HST will apply at a single rate of 15 per cent on the 
same base of goods and services as the current GST. The rules 
governing the operation of the HST will be set out in the Excise Tax 
Act and will generally be those rules on which the GST currently 
operates subject to the streamlining changes I have already 
mentioned.
<P>
	Under the terms of the agreements which are before us now in 
legislative form, the HST will be administered initially by Revenue 
Canada and eventually by the proposed border and revenue agency. 
Businesses that are registered for the GST will automatically be 
registered for the HST and will continue to use the current GST 
return. There are no changes there.
<P>
	The HST base will be the same as the GST base. Vendors will be 
required to price on a tax included basis to ensure that consumers 
are aware of the final price before they reach the cash register.
<P>
<B>(1040 )</B>
<P>
	At the same time, because the HST is in large measure about 
federal-provincial co-operation, the specific situations and the 
specific priorities of participating provinces are fully reflected in 
the agreements. The participating provinces will for example 
provide point of sale rebates for book sales in those provinces. The 
rules governing rebates for housing and public sector bodies will 
reflect the particular circumstances of each province.
<P>
	A further important reflection of the spirit of federal-provincial 
co-operation that gave rise to these agreements is the transitional 
assistance that the federal government will provide to help offset 
revenue shortfalls in participating provinces. Hon. members know 
that this government has never shied away from important 
structural change. It has always recognized the importance of 
providing transitional assistance to make such changes possible, be 
it with regard to removing subsidies from the agricultural sector or 
promoting important sales tax harmonization.
<P>
	In adopting the HST, the Atlantic provinces have replaced a 
system that is cumbersome, costly and complicated with one that is 
simpler, cheaper and a lot more efficient. For consumers, 
businesses and taxpayers in the participating provinces, the result 
will be one sales tax not two, one tax base not two, one tax rate not 
two, one sales tax administration not two, and one price not two. 
These changes will add up to a simpler, fairer system and a stronger 
economy.
<P>
	Consumers in participating provinces will benefit in a number of 
important ways. First among those will be the lower rate of tax. For 
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick the combined rate of 15 per cent 
will represent a decrease of nearly four percentage points in the 
effective sales tax rate. In Newfoundland and Labrador the rate 
decrease will be close to 5 per cent. Consumers will also benefit 
from the removal of provincial retail sales tax from business inputs 
and from lower compliance costs for businesses.
<P>
	The overall impact of the tax from the perspective of consumers 
is that prices on most goods will be lower as will the overall sales 
tax burden.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Including the HST in the prices displayed gives consumers 
another important advantage. It puts an end to the surprise they get 
at the cash register, which is one of the most annoying features of 
the current system. However, the consumers will still know the 
amount of tax they are paying since the exact amount, or the tax 
rate, will be printed on receipts and bills.
<P>
	This approach will reduce unfair competition between 
businesses that are located in participating provinces and those that 
are not. Furthermore, businesses will be able to continue using the 
cash 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7003"> 7003 </A></B>
<P>
registers they have now and  still comply with the requirement that 
the tax be included in the price.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Businesses, like consumers, will benefit from the lower 
combined tax rate. In addition they will now have to deal with only 
one set of tax forms, one set of operating rules and one tax 
administration. By thus reducing the paper burden and 
administrative hassle associated with a two tier system, the HST 
will reduce compliance costs for businesses.
<P>
	The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants has estimated 
that if all non-harmonized provinces were to join in a national sales 
tax system, Canadian businesses would save between $400 million 
and $700 million in administrative costs alone. The benefits of 
lower compliance costs will be particularly advantageous for small 
businesses which bear disproportionately the costs of dealing with 
the current two systems.
<P>
	A further benefit to businesses in the participating provinces will 
be the recovery of HST payable on their inputs. In fact, 
harmonization will eliminate over $700 million in hidden sales 
taxes on business inputs, taxes which have been passed on in the 
past to consumers. Harmonization will eliminate $280 million in 
hidden sales taxes in Nova Scotia, $265 million in New Brunswick 
and $180 million in Newfoundland and Labrador. The elimination 
of this hidden tax drag will promote the competitiveness of 
businesses in Atlantic Canada. It will also promote fairness 
between different kinds of businesses since the tax will not impact 
differently on businesses just because they are structured 
differently. The broadening of the tax base will also help ensure a 
level playing field between businesses that sell different kinds of 
products.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	The proposed legislation also includes rules to ensure a level 
playing field for all businesses selling in participating provinces. 
Under the proposed approach, businesses across Canada that are 
registered for the GST will be required to collect and remit the HST 
on goods and services sold into a participating province or shipped 
to a consumer in that province.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I want to stress the fact that this is not a new tax on goods and 
services sold in the participating provinces. Interprovincial sales 
have always been subject to the sales tax. The new approach simply 
makes collecting and paying the tax easier.
<P>
	Not only will the HST benefit consumers and be simpler and 
more equitable for businesses, it will also generate some overall 
economic advantages, especially because the provincial retail sales 
taxes will be abolished on all the business inputs I have just 
mentioned.
<P>
	The elimination of provincial retail sales taxes on those business 
inputs is a benefit not only for the businesses directly affected. It is 
important to realize that this measure will reduce the overall cost of 
exports from participating provinces and eliminate the competitive 
advantage that is now unintentionally extended to imports.
<P>
	Furthermore, because it will ensure fair competition among 
various types of products and business structures, the elimination 
of the tax on inputs will simplify the context for investment 
decision making.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	All of this translates into more economic activity for Atlantic 
Canada and more jobs. Government administrative costs will also 
be reduced through the elimination of overlap and duplication in 
the administration of federal and provincial sales taxes.
<P>
	As I said earlier, these changes will add up to a simpler, fairer 
system and a stronger economy. They clearly meet the criteria set 
out in the red book and in the recommendations of the finance 
committee for replacing the GST. Equally important, they 
represent the significant first stage in a process by which I am 
confident other provinces will come on board. They will do that 
sooner or later because harmonization offers significant benefits. 
The more provinces that join in, the greater those benefits because 
most existing provincial sales tax systems are inefficient and 
distorting and the provinces know that.
<P>
	In provinces across Canada, existing retail sales taxes are killing 
businesses and jobs. Personally I believe the provincial 
governments recognize this just as they recognize that taxes on 
business inputs are taxes that are hidden and are currently being 
passed on to consumers.
<P>
	The legislation before us improves the operation of the GST 
across Canada. For the participating Atlantic provinces it provides 
an even better system, a system that will benefit consumers with 
lower tax rates and on many goods, lower prices. They will also 
know the full price of goods before they get to the cash register.
<P>
	It is a system that will benefit businesses because they will deal 
with only one tax, one rate, one base, one set of forms, one 
administration. That system will benefit the economy of Atlantic 
Canada by making its exports more competitive. It is a system and 
a bill that deserves the unqualified support of every member of the 
House.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, contrary to my habit, I am not pleased to speak to this bill, 
since the government has acquired the unfortunate habit of 
``tossing''-I think this is the exact term-a bill of over 350 pages 
on the table about 16 hours before the debate in this House.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7004"> 7004 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	On an issue as important as this one, it was inappropriate for the 
government to table this document yesterday afternoon, as we were 
forced to work in the evening and all night to do our job as official 
opposition and find in what ways the government is misleading the 
people.
<P>
	Although this is inappropriate, the government has acquired this 
habit in the last few weeks. I hope this is simply an administrative 
problem, which I seriously doubt, given the nature of the subject.
<P>
	You know the GST is a sensitive issue. In the minds of 
Quebecers and Canadians, the GST is the current Liberal 
government's worst failure, in that it really betrayed its promise to 
abolish the GST.
<P>
	I think this is a rather hypocritical way of ensuring that the 
debate is quick, succinct and also lends itself to quick analysis and 
implementation. This is not the way things work in a democracy. I 
thought that, in a democracy, the government ought to have the 
courage of its convictions, of the measures announced to the people 
and give the official opposition time to analyze, criticize and also 
propose ways to improve bills, because it is our role to make 
constructive recommendations. I see this is not the case and it is the 
first thing for which I blame the government.
<P>
	Bill C-70 is aimed at harmonizing the GST with sales taxes in 
the three maritime provinces and at providing a federal tax 
exemption for books that are bought by literacy centres, schools, 
colleges and so on, without eliminating the GST on books bought 
by the general public.
<P>
	This bill is the embodiment of untruthfulness, of the show the 
Liberals have been putting on for us since the last election. I 
remind you of the solemn promise the Liberals made with one hand 
on their heart while looking at the Canadian flag: ``That damn GST, 
we will abolish it when we come to office''.
<P>
	Very interesting quotations were made by Liberals in the last 
three or four years, including the Deputy Prime Minister and 
member for Hamilton East who said on March 11, 1996:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``I have already said personally and very directly that if the GST 
is not abolished I will resign''. She resigned, but only for a few 
weeks. She resigned, but for show, and this show cost Canadians 
more than half a million dollars for her re-election.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister had said she would resign if the GST 
was not abolished. Normally, people who have convictions and are 
loyal to their beliefs and to the public as well do not resign for show 
as the Deputy Prime Minister did. They resign and go home, 
because it looks like the public was deceived.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister was away for a few weeks and came 
back with a smile, saying: ``The people of Canada have forgiven 
me; the people of Hamilton East have forgiven me''. The Canadian 
electorate will not forgive the government for breaking such an 
important promise, one the Liberals used to score political points 
while in opposition, during the election campaign and, in a 
different way, with Bill C-70. It is not right to keep deliberately 
deceiving the public in that way.
<P>
	I will refer our listeners and our constituents to an article 
published in <I>Le Soleil</I> on Wednesday, June 19. I would say this 
editorial by Gilbert Lavoie summarizes quite well what the Deputy 
Prime Minister has put us through by first resigning and then 
coming back for show.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	Let me read you some excerpts from this excellent editorial 
written by Gilbert Lavoie. The original text has been slightly 
modified to avoid using the name of the Deputy Prime Minister. It 
says the following: ``Her victory in the Hamilton East by-election 
on Monday did not prove a thing, except perhaps the cynicism and 
arrogance of a certain political class. She had promised to resign if 
the government did not abolish the GST as promised. She did 
resign, but only to get immediately re-elected in a by-election, 
standing for the same party, the same government, the same GST. 
The cost of this operation, amounting to $500,000, was borne by 
Canadian taxpayers''. Half a million dollars so she could pretend to 
try to clear her name and that of her government.
<P>
	I read on, because this is too interesting an editorial not to take 
full advantage of it: ``In politics, anyone who resigns on a question 
of principle is expected to leave the party to go and sit as an 
independent member or to found a new party as Lucien Bouchard 
did. It is, however, difficult to understand how the Deputy Prime 
Minister, who explained when she resigned that she could no 
longer look voters in the eye, can now feel comfortable about 
resuming her functions within the Liberal government. During the 
by-election campaign, the member for Hamilton East explained her 
attitude as follows: `The GST ranks eighth among public concerns, 
far behind jobs and the preservation of social services. Its 
importance should therefore not-and I am still quoting the Deputy 
Prime Minister-be overestimated'''.
<P>
	I will stop quoting the article for a moment to point out that the 
importance of the GST issue is due to the Liberals themselves, who 
overreacted at the time, under the Tory government. For a few 
weeks, they put up a bitter fight over the GST, tearing at their 
shirts, shouting themselves hoarse, and demanding the GST be 
scrapped, the hated GST as they then referred to it. You certainly 
remember that time, Mr. Speaker.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7005"> 7005 </A></B>
<P>
	They are now saying that the importance of the GST must not 
be exaggerated, but they were elected partly under false pretences, 
saying they would abolish the GST. They are now telling us not 
to exaggerate the importance of the GST. This is incredible. No 
wonder politicians are at the very bottom of the credibility list. 
When people are deceived in this way by a certain cynical and 
arrogant political class, it is perfectly normal to find that class at 
the bottom of the list.
<P>
	Let me quote Gilbert Lavoie's article again, as it is very 
interesting and informative: ``But her fake resignation from 
government-from the Liberal Party-is nonetheless sad 
buffoonery from someone whose presence in politics has always 
been based on public morality. She has in turn contributed to 
Canadians' increasingly cynical view of their politicians''.
<P>
	As a Montrealer, Émile Boudreau summed it up very well in a 
letter to the editor of Le Devoir, which reflects public opinion: 
``You resign, you shed a tear before the cameras, and the very same 
day you run as a candidate and you are re-elected. You resurface 
clean, clean, clean. The Liberal Party goes up one notch in the 
public's opinion, and life could not better be''.
<P>
	Mr. Lavoie's article and Mr. Boudreau's letter reflect a profound 
public discontent toward politicians. They also reflect the reason 
politicians feel increasingly criticized by the public, and 
deservedly so.
<P>
	When you see an attitude such as the one displayed regarding the 
GST issue, when you see the Deputy Prime Minister's attitude, 
when you see the secretary of state introduce a measure like this 
one as if it included incredible improvements, you realize why 
people are fed up and why my constituents in the riding of 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot are also fed up with the federal 
government and the ``frame-up'' that is really starting to get on 
their nerves.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister was not the only one, with her 
spectacular resignation, to reflect the whole GST issue. The current 
Prime Minister had also said, before, during and even after the 
election campaign, that the GST had to be abolished.
<P>
	However, there is no mention of abolishing the GST in this bill. 
This measure is a result of a political agreement signed with three 
maritime provinces, an agreement which will cost Canadians $1 
billion in political compensation, just to give the impression that 
the government has done something about the GST.
<P>
	The Liberals did not promise, during the campaign, to sign an 
agreement with the maritime provinces and then waste $1 billion to 
buy the maritimes' approval regarding the GST. They promised to 
abolish the GST. The Prime Minister said it over and over again. 
During the 1993 election campaign, he said: ``We will scrap the  
GST''. To ``scrap'' means to tear up, to throw out, to get rid of the 
current GST system and to replace it.
<P>
	On May 2, 1994, after his election, the Prime Minister said, and I 
quote: ``We hate the GST and we will kill it''. But the GST is still 
there. The only change is that the tax is included in the price. It is 
now a hidden tax. In the maritimes, people do not realize that the 
federal government is charging them a 15 per cent tax on goods and 
services.
<P>
	I listened to the secretary of state who said the government had 
extensive consultations with tax experts and the public, in an 
attempt to justify the government's lack or action on the GST. The 
Liberals also consulted tax experts and other people before 
introducing their election platform and telling the public they 
would abolish the GST, either that or they were saying just about 
anything during the election campaign.
<P>
	If they say just about anything during the campaign and could 
not care less about people, when the next election comes, the 
people of Quebec and Canada should remember that every time a 
member of the Liberal Party opens his or her mouth it is to say 
things that will not withstand close scrutiny, to make promises they 
will not keep and say any old thing to lie to people.
<P>
	I think people are beginning to understand what is going on with 
this government and also that members of the Liberal Party: 
Liberal MPs and the Liberal candidates in the next election are 
people who show considerable cynicism and unequalled arrogance. 
When the next election comes, their cynicism and their arrogance 
will cost them dearly.
<P>
	Talking about the government's arrogance, cynicism and total 
disregard for the public, we must remember there was also a time 
when the Liberals were the official opposition. There was a time 
when the Liberals were sitting on these benches. At that time, also, 
the Liberals were saying just about anything. They made promises 
they are not keeping today. I would like to recall what the Liberal 
majority wrote in the finance committee report in 1994: ``It would 
just not be appropriate to hide the GST in the sales price''. Yet, the 
agreement signed with the three maritime provinces includes a 
provision that will in fact hide the GST in the sales price.
<P>
	When they were in opposition, the Liberals, in 1989, stated in the 
dissenting report they tabled that, if the GST were hidden in the 
sales price, it would make it that much easier for the government to 
raise it later on. They were condemning the fact that the 
government wanted to hide the goods and services tax in the sales 
price. Now, there is no problem. In 1989, they were adamantly 
against hiding the GST in the sales price, stating that it was a ploy 
used by the government to be able to raise the tax rate later on 
without the taxpayer noticing it. And, now, in Bill C-70, in the 
agreement between the federal government and the maritimes, they 
are saying there is no problem. It has been hidden in the price. The 
Liberals  tore their hair out, played holier than thou for months and 
even 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7006"> 7006 </A></B>
<P>
years under the Conservative government, but now there is no 
problem.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	How can we trust this government? Every time eminent 
members of the government party rise in this House and say: ``We 
are going to do this and that'', how can we believe them, when they 
keep saying just about anything that comes to mind, as they have 
done with the GST, reneging on their promises and forgetting all 
about their commitments? The people have to realize that the 
government could not care less about them.
<P>
	Let us talk about patronage. The agreement reached with the 
three maritime provinces is akin to patronage. Given the pressure 
exerted by Canadians, who wanted the government to keep its 
promise to get rid of the GST, the finance minister thought it would 
be better to do something, to pretend once again that he was solving 
the problem. And that is when he signed the deal with the three 
maritime provinces.
<P>
	This agreement came with a price, a compensation of around $1 
billion handed out to the three maritime provinces. The finance 
minister bought the three provinces with $1 billion in 
compensation. He told the maritimes: ``I need you to grandstand, to 
act as if the Canadian government is doing something about the 
GST, is trying to harmonize it''. First, the tax was supposed to be 
abolished, now it was going to be harmonized.
<P>
	The maritimes replied: ``Minister, if you want to, we will go 
along with you, but there will be a price to pay''. And the finance 
minister, known for his generosity and his wise management of the 
public funds, agreed to put $1 billion on the table. Is it enough? 
This is $1 billion the finance minister took out of his pocket, 
meaning out of our pockets. This is the money that Revenue 
Canada takes out of taxpayers' pockets year after year.
<P>
	Given his generosity and his tendency to waste our money, the 
finance minister has taken out $1 billion to give it to the maritime 
provinces. This is $1 billion that Quebecers and Canadians outside 
the maritime provinces will have to pay. They will have to pay for 
this generous gift by the finance minister.
<P>
	The provinces and especially Quebec are angry about this, but 
not the three maritime provinces, which will receive $1 billion. No, 
those provinces are not upset. But, outside the maritime provinces, 
people are very angry, particularly in Quebec. Quebec will have to 
take $250 million out of its own pocket to pay the three maritime 
provinces, to pay for the finance minister's patronage.
<P>
	Quebecers are even more upset, since Quebec has already 
harmonized its provincial sales tax with the GST. I have been 
saying and repeating it for a long time because, if there is an 
example of true harmonization as  well as true harmony between 
the federal government and Quebec, it is the GST.
<P>
	The Quebec government has acted in good faith. We harmonized 
the tax. We even agreed to administer it on behalf of the federal 
government. We are nice in Quebec, but we did not get one penny 
for all our efforts. The federal government did not compensate us 
despite giving $1 billion to the maritime provinces.
<P>
	The Quebec government is entitled to some kind of 
compensation, since it has harmonized its tax. To give $1 billion to 
the maritime provinces is unfair to Quebec and to the other 
provinces, which could come on board with the HST but oppose 
any preferential treatment. If the maritime provinces get to keep 
the $1 billion, they want to be compensated as well.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	On behalf of the Government of Quebec, the Deputy Premier and 
finance minister of Quebec, Bernard Landry, repeatedly asked the 
federal government and the federal finance minister to provide him 
with the formula used to work out this famous $1 billion 
compensation for the maritimes. We have asked for it day after day, 
we have asked the minister to make the formula used to come up 
with this $1 billion public.
<P>
	By stubbornly refusing to reveal the formula, the government 
showed that this agreement was a political one, that the agreement 
providing for the payment of $1 billion to the maritimes was 
concluded for the sole purpose of buying the maritimes off. And we 
can assume that, in the discussions with the finance minister, the 
maritimes set a very high price for accepting the political 
``frame-up'' that this minister offered them.
<P>
	The people will also remember this waste of public funds. It is 
all very well for the finance minister to say to everyone that he is 
responsible for today's economic situation, but we know he only 
coasted along with the growth in the economy, he only took 
advantage of an overall economic climate that was favourable to 
him, and he only took advantage of extremely low interest rates.
<P>
	Do you know why interest rates are extremely low? There are 
three main reasons. First, it is because of the state of the U.S. 
economy. Second, it is because of the domestic economic climate, 
that is the chronic lack of jobs for 800,000 Canadians. Eight 
hundred thousand unemployed means that there are also 800,000 
fewer consumers. If there are fewer consumers, prices are lower, so 
inflation is less likely to increase. And when inflation is low, and 
even too low-that is close to 1 per cent as it is now-interest rates 
also go down.
<P>
	The finance minister is only taking advantage of this situation. If 
he had been here in 1990 and 1984, the finance minister would 
have received quite a beating. I will remind you of certain facts that 
make you smile. You will remember that during those two periods 
it was not easy to be the Canadian Minister of Finance because  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7007"> 7007 </A></B>
<P>
economic conditions were very unfavourable for a flamboyant 
character in that office.
<P>
	But the present minister takes advantage of the situation. 
However, people will remember that he is wasting public funds. He 
has no right to waste $1 billion as he is doing right now on the GST 
to hide the inertia of his government and its inability to fulfil its 
promises.
<P>
	One billion dollars will be paid out, and the Minister of Finance 
tells us that this is only the beginning. Quebecers and Canadians 
will have to pay this $1 billion in political compensation to the 
maritimes for many years to come. Do you know why? I will give 
you a technical but very short and, I hope, not too tedious 
explanation.
<P>
	The finance minister offered to replace the provincial sales taxes 
in the maritimes and the GST with a single 15 per cent sales tax. In 
the maritime provinces, the total of both the PST and the GST 
averages 19 per cent. The finance minister said: ``I will replace 
those taxes totalling 19 per cent with a unique 15 per cent sales 
tax''. Therefore, the sales tax dropped by 4 per cent in the 
maritimes. But who is going to pay for that? Who will compensate 
for lost revenues in the maritime provinces? We, the people from 
the other provinces, will. And do you know why? Because of 
something called the equalization formula.
<P>
	Few people, even on the government benches, understand this 
formula, but it can be understood if one takes the time to study it 
carefully. This formula is used when a province, for example one of 
Canada's poorest provinces, needs help because it is difficult for 
that province to collect enough taxes from its population to provide 
public services equivalent to what is provided elsewhere across 
Canada. That is where this formula comes in.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	When a province's tax base-that is its ability to collect 
taxes-is reduced, the federal government uses the equalization 
formula to compensate.
<P>
	In the case of the maritimes, once again, the finance minister, 
generous as he is with taxpayers' money, told the Atlantic 
provinces that he would reduce the general sales tax and that the 
federal government would compensate them for the missing 4 per 
cent, year after year, until the end of time.
<P>
	The equalization formula is used automatically when the tax 
base is reduced. The Minister of Finance has reduced the tax base. 
Therefore, we, as Quebecers and Canadians, will always be paying 
for that. As a Quebecer, I am not so sure of that because, one day, 
we will get out of that system. However, starting next year, 
Quebecers and Canadians will be paying for the loss of revenues 
from provincial sales taxes in the maritimes.
<P>
	So on top of the $1 billion that the finance minister is wasting 
shamelessly for purely political reasons, which is already too 
much, Quebecers and Canadians will have to pay hundreds of 
millions more each year to the maritime provinces to compensate 
for this political decision. This is getting to be very expensive for 
mere window dressing.
<P>
	Half a million dollars for the Deputy Prime Minister's election, a 
billion in political compensation to the maritimes and now the 
equalization formula that will be there forever, or until the day the 
decision is made to do away with it within the federal system, or 
until the day, coming soon, when we decide to withdraw totally 
from this system, which has nothing going for it. So that is bill 
C-70, concerning the agreement with the maritimes.
<P>
	There are two other points I would like to speak to, in order to 
clarify things for the public. The first concerns the famous national 
revenue commission. The Minister of Finance has presented us 
with this agreement with the maritime provinces as a model of 
harmonization, a blueprint for the rest of Canada.
<P>
	First of all, if it is a model, it is a very poor one, a very costly 
one. Second, if it is an augur for the future in the rest of Canada, 
that is extremely worrisome. It is a deliberate attack on provincial 
autonomy in collecting taxes. The Minister of Finance has 
established a national revenue commission which will replace all 
of the government bodies in the maritime provinces which used to 
collect taxes on goods and services.
<P>
	This commission was announced in the government's throne 
speech, and the government is holding stubbornly on to it. Its 
intent, using the GST and the maritimes as an example, is to have 
the federal government one day become the only body within the 
Canadian federation to collect income tax, and other taxes, from 
Quebecers and Canadians. Quite a neat trick, especially where 
Quebec is concerned.
<P>
	I am very familiar with Quebec taxation history, even what went 
on in meetings in the time of Messrs. Pearson and Lesage. They 
started off discussing the exchange of tax points at a time when the 
idea was to restore the provinces' taxation autonomy, of which they 
had been deprived during the first world war. Income tax, and other 
things, were borrowed.
<P>
	Given this background, the numerous constitutional 
conferences, the meetings of finance ministers over thirty or so 
years, I am convinced that, if this is what the federal government 
has in mind, it will run into a brick wall in Quebec, where they are 
fed up with the federal government's designs on its taxation 
autonomy.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	Quebecers wanted to have their own taxation system and 
autonomous institutions in areas like education and others. They 
would see it as an attack on their own history and their identity if 
the federal government  considered the possibility of introducing a 
bill allowing a Canada revenue commission to replace Revenu 
Québec.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7008"> 7008 </A></B>
<P>
	I cannot understand the political logic behind such a measure, 
unless the federal government is looking for a fight with Quebec. I 
believe this is what we are heading for. Let us harmonize, no 
problem. Quebec will receive no compensation while the maritime 
provinces received a billion dollars. And now this government 
wants to create a Canada revenue commission. What is it looking 
for? Sometimes I have a feeling that the federal government is 
looking for trouble.
<P>
	Once it has created problems, it pulls out and puts the blame on 
the separatists of Quebec, on sovereignists who are allegedly 
against any agreement with the federal government. This is, to a 
certain extent, the game the Liberals have been playing since they 
came to power three years ago.
<P>
	Quebec has some news for the Liberal government if it thinks it 
will be able to create a national revenue commission and sideline 
Quebec. We will be ready for them and we will have the official 
opposition on our side.
<P>
	I wish to end on a more positive note about the bill. We always 
keep dessert for the end. There is one small positive aspect to Bill 
C-70 which is due to the official opposition and it has to do with the 
partial removal of the tax on books.
<P>
	In the bill, the government suggests that books purchased by 
literacy and educational organizations not be taxed. Not just in the 
maritimes, but throughout Canada. This is good news, but it is not 
enough.
<P>
	Most of the books bought in Quebec and in Canada are not 
bought by educational and literacy organizations. If the 
government wanted to do something, it should remove the tax on 
all books sold, because it is just taxing ignorance. We have all 
heard the slogans about GST on books chanted by those concerned 
with literacy and the transmission of culture.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to point out two things. The 
first is that there is no provincial sales tax on books in Quebec. 
Zero PST. Culture is important.
<P>
	The second thing is that, even before the Bloc Quebecois became 
an official party, back when there were only seven members, with 
Lucien Bouchard as their leader, those seven members took every 
opportunity that came their way to rise in their places and criticize 
GST on books.
<P>
	They fought against it outside the House too, because back then 
their time in the House was limited. Those whose decision it was to 
limit the time available to the Bloc Quebecois must be regretting it 
bitterly today. They must remember it. We certainly do.
<P>
	The seven Bloc Quebecois members, including the eminent 
members for Rosemont and Richelieu whom I can see today, 
worked very hard to keep the GST off  books. When I see a timid 
little measure, which is a step in the right direction, but not big 
enough, I cannot help but praise the seven founding members of the 
Bloc Quebecois for their determined efforts.
<P>
	Politics is a drawn out process sometimes, but eventually one 
gets results. And in this case, the result is a watered down one, but 
it is still a result. I would now like to urge the government, and I 
think I speak for all my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois, to 
remove the tax on all books sold in Quebec and in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	The two founding nations have a duty to promote cultural 
awareness. They have a duty to see that people read Quebec and 
Canadian authors. The government has a duty to make sure that our 
authors can sell their works at competitive prices. The Minister of 
Finance says public finances are quite healthy, so perhaps he 
should do something to help culture, to ensure its survival.
<P>
	That concludes my remarks on Bill C-70. I would like to table an 
amendment. I move, seconded by my colleague, the member for 
Trois-Rivières:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word ``That'' and 
substituting the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``Bill C-70, An Act to amend the Excise Tax Act, the Federal-Provincial Fiscal 
Arrangements Act, the Income Tax Act, the Debt Servicing and Reduction Account 
Act and related Acts, be not now read a second time but that it be read a second time 
this day six months hence.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The motion moved by the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot is in order.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak to Bill C-70, an act to amend the Excise Tax Act, 
the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act, the Income Tax 
Act, the Debt Servicing and Reduction Account Act and related 
acts. Really what this has to do with is the harmonization of the 
GST in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	Before I speak specifically about Atlantic Canada it is important 
to go back and discuss the chronology of events which led us to this 
point.
<P>
	It is accurate to say that this legislation was born of very dubious 
parentage. We had a promise born of a loose lipped government 
member and we had a father who could only be called political 
opportunism. How sad that this young harmonized GST had to be 
raised in such a dysfunctional home, or should I say house?
<P>
	Since 1990 it has become very clear that the government was 
being very opportunistic in discussing the GST and in suggesting to 
Canadians that when it came to power somehow the GST would 
magically disappear.
<P>
	Just to remind hon. members across the way what exactly their 
record is on this, let me refer to some quotes  that came from 
government members over the last several years with respect to the 
GST to remind them how far they have gone astray from their 
original promise.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7009"> 7009 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us go back to government members when they were in 
opposition, in the wake of the GST coming into place under the 
Conservative government. Let me start by quoting some members 
who now hold prominent positions in the cabinet of the Liberal 
government.
<P>
	First, let us go to a quote which came from the current Liberal 
House leader back in the days following the GST coming into place 
under the Conservative government.
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	The current Liberal House leader said: ``Not only do the Liberals 
oppose the GST now, that opposition will continue even if the bill 
is passed. We are not interested in tinkering with the GST. We do 
not want it at all''.
<P>
	Meanwhile, the current finance minister said: ``I would abolish 
the GST''. The Prime Minister said: ``I want the tax dead''. One of 
the quotes that came from the Toronto <I>Star</I> back then was: ``The 
Liberals will scrap the goods and services tax if they win the next 
general election, the leader of the party said. He said: `I am 
opposed to the GST. I have always been opposed to it and I will be 
opposed to it always'''.
<P>
	We saw the climax of the quotes that came from all the various 
members in October 1993 on the eve of the election when the 
current Deputy Prime Minister, on national television-that image 
will be frozen forever in my mind and probably in the minds of 
Canadians everywhere-said: ``If the GST is not abolished under a 
Liberal government I will resign''.
<P>
	We all know that Liberal MPs campaigned in many ridings on 
the promise to abolish the GST. I know members will say that the 
red book stated it would be replaced. However, I need to point out 
that the government did not find the courage to bring the red book 
out until about a month before the election. They only produced 
about 70,000 copies. They did not talk about their promise with 
respect to the GST. Instead, they allowed people to think that they 
were going to still do what they said they would do early on which 
is to get rid of the GST altogether, scrap, axe and abolish the GST. 
However, that is not what they did.
<P>
	All of this, of course, led up to the event last spring when the 
government was under great pressure to fulfil the promise made by 
the Deputy Prime Minister on national television. First the finance 
minister said that perhaps they had made a mistake. However, a lot 
of Canadians felt that he was pressured into that position and it was 
not coming from his heart.
<P>
	Ultimately the Deputy Prime Minister was forced to resign. She 
went to great lengths to make it look like she was doing the 
honourable thing, but we know she polled  her constituents first to 
find out whether she still had enough credibility to win the election 
in Hamilton East. Then of course she announced that she had been 
at the bank machine and could not look anybody in the eye and felt 
she had to resign. Well, $500,000 later she was back in the House 
of Commons.
<P>
	The whole incident was a black mark on the history of 
parliamentary promises. There have been a lot of broken promises 
over the years but none more blatant than that broken GST promise 
of this Liberal government. I do not think that the government has 
yet paid the full price for it.
<P>
	I want to set those incidents aside for a moment and talk about 
some of the aspects of the bill, the harmonized GST. First I would 
argue that the harmonized GST is extremely divisive the way the 
government has brought it in.
<P>
	Members will recall that the government, to get Newfoundland, 
New Brunswick and Nova Scotia on side, had to go to them with an 
offer of $1 billion if they would come on board. It had to try and 
save face with $1 billion because although there was always the 
opportunity for any province to come on board and say that they 
were very interested in the new harmonized GST, there were no 
takers. The government was under great pressure at that point. 
Therefore, the only thing the government could think to do to bring 
governments on board was to offer up a billion dollars. It went to 
the Atlantic premiers and said if they came on board it had a cool 
$1 billion in hush money for them. That is insulting and causes 
great divisions in the country. It encourages dependency. It 
encourages the provinces to be under the thumb of the federal 
government. That is not acceptable as we approach the 21st 
century.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	Some provinces are becoming very responsible. They have 
certainly shown more responsibility in dealing with their finances 
than the federal government has. They have taken leadership roles 
in all kinds of other areas. For the government to say it is going to 
pay $1 billion for those provinces to come on board if they are kind 
of quiet about things and just go along with it is insulting.
<P>
	I want to talk about how divisive that is. I and my friends in the 
Reform Party, and Liberals if they are honest about it, probably 
have had constituents come to them and ask why are they are 
paying more taxes so the government can come up with $1 billion 
to give to three Atlantic premiers? It is very divisive.
<P>
	I received a fax not too long ago from Lorne Taylor, the MLA for 
Medicine Hat-Cyprus in Alberta. He pointed out that the Alberta 
treasury had produced a document that said the effect of giving $1 
billion to Atlantic Canada, except for P.E.I., was to lower the GST 
in those provinces to 5.5 per cent for the first two years of the deal. 
In speaking up for his constituents, which is  the right thing to do, 
he asked why Alberta did not get that deal.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7010"> 7010 </A></B>
<P>
	Ontario asked why in the world did it not get the same kind of 
deal. If Ontario were to harmonize, it would cost about $3 billion. 
The finance minister in Ontario, speaking for the people of his 
province, said $3 billion is what Ontario would require of this 
so-called adjustment money if Ontario was to come on board.
<P>
	If I remember correctly, Manitoba and Saskatchewan came up 
with figures too. They were asking for money as well. I do not 
blame them. They were simply asking for what the premiers in 
Atlantic Canada got.
<P>
	What did the government do? The government said no way, they 
are not getting any money, it is for those three provinces alone. It is 
divisive when one or three provinces are treated in a special way 
and the others are not treated the same way.
<P>
	This has always been the way of the Liberal Party. It has made a 
career out of creating these types of divisions. Obviously it has 
served them well but it has not served the interests of Canadians as 
a whole. That is one very important reason why Reform is speaking 
against Bill C-70.
<P>
	Another concern I have with this legislation is that it raises taxes. 
I know the government will say that all it is doing is broadening the 
base in Atlantic Canada and it will be a wash. It just is not so. It is 
not true.
<P>
	This is a huge bill with many different aspects to it. It addresses 
all kinds of different things. One of the most pernicious aspects of 
the bill is the removal of the notional input tax credit. That was 
done back in April. I remember when it was announced. A lot of 
people did not know what it meant. An accounting firm in 
Winnipeg picked up on it right away. It said that it could amount to 
as much as $1 billion a year tax grab for the government.
<P>
	The government had removed the input credit on used goods 
thereby ensuring that every time a used good changed hands the tax 
would cascade. In other words, if that good was bought after 
someone else had owned it and someone before that had owned it 
and someone before that had owned it, pretty soon there would be 
tax on tax on tax paid. There is no input credit going to the person 
who sold it. Pretty soon the value of that item would be inflated 
way out of proportion because of tax on tax on tax.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	The result is that the government will reap all kinds of new 
revenue. Of course, a lot of the higher costs would be passed on to 
consumers. Potentially the government reaps a billion dollars more 
a year in new revenue.
<P>
	It is a hidden tax grab, one that was never really debated. We 
raised it many times in the House. We received responses from RV 
and car dealers who were concerned and upset about it. To this date, 
the government has not given an adequate answer on how it can go 
ahead with it. People need to be made aware of it and that is why I 
am raising it right now.
<P>
	That is not the only way the bill raises taxes. On April 1, when 
the bill comes into law, as undoubtedly it will, capital taxes will go 
up in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. That is one provision of the 
bill. It allows the provinces to implement capital taxes. That is 
precisely what two provinces are going to do. The provinces will be 
given a new lever to raise taxes.
<P>
	The Nova Scotia finance minister and the Halifax Chamber of 
Commerce have pointed out that one of the consequences of this 
bill will be that property taxes in Nova Scotia are going to go up. 
That is another aspect of the bill that leads to higher taxes.
<P>
	I want to move on to a related area. This bill will not only raise 
taxes it will entrench higher taxes. Something which has not been 
discussed enough is the fact that changes to the provincial portion 
of the tax are going to be quite complicated, in fact, almost 
impossible, if governments want to lower the tax, but much easier 
if they want to raise the tax.
<P>
	I do not know if members realize that it will require unanimity of 
all the provinces, should sales taxes be harmonized across the 
country, to lower the provincial portion of the tax. The provinces 
are being asked to do what they have probably almost never done 
before, and that is for the 10 of them agree on one thing at one time, 
to lower taxes. But they only need a simple majority if they want to 
raise taxes.
<P>
	Obviously this gives the governments of the provinces a 
powerful new tool to go about raising taxes if the government gets 
its wish and the GST is harmonized across the country.
<P>
	There is an ongoing debate in the country about taxes and tax 
increases. However, the debate is not about how high they should 
be raised, it is about how low they should go. The government has 
put in a provision to raises taxes, not to lower them. That is 
ridiculous. Reform cannot support that. Canadians will be outraged 
when they discover that one aspect of Bill C-70, the act to 
implement the harmonized GST in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	It is important to point out that it is not only the Reform Party 
that has raised this concern. Back in 1990 when the current finance 
minister was running for the leadership, and a lot of people would 
argue that he has never quit running for it, he pointed out that he 
thought he would scrap the GST. Not only that, he made special 
reference to the fact that once a harmonized GST is in place across 
the country, it could not be removed. Taxes could not be lowered.
<P>
	If he felt so strongly about it then, what happened between 1990 
and now? When did the conversion of Paul on the road to 
Damascus take place? What precisely  influenced him to think that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7011"> 7011 </A></B>
<P>
now all of a sudden the provinces are going to fall into line, all 10 
at once, and agree to decrease the provincial portion of the GST? It 
simply will not happen. It is simply not going to happen; 10 
provinces agreeing to cut the tax. The finance minister was right in 
1990 when he said that it is not going to happen. I think it is right 
today that it simply will not happen. At a time when we are having 
a debate about taxes in this country we should be finding ways to 
lower taxes, not to increase them.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	I want to say another word about entrenched taxes and about why 
harmonization is a bad idea. One of the great benefits of not 
harmonizing is that it encourages a competition between different 
jurisdictions to keep taxes low.
<P>
	We all know about competition in the marketplace but I think 
competition in government is just as important. That is why for 
instance in my native province of Alberta, where we have no sales 
tax, we have low income taxes, we have the great Alberta 
advantage and people in our province have paid a price to have that 
advantage. We have had to cut back on our spending so that we 
could afford to keep those taxes nice and low. Now that we have got 
to that point, we want to benefit from that advantage. We want to 
attract business from all over the world. In fact, we are.
<P>
	The very fact that Alberta has those low tax rates is, believe it or 
not, a great benefit to the rest of the country not only because the 
rest of the country gets spin-off benefits from what happens in 
Alberta and Alberta sends a lot of money into equalization 
payments, but because it puts a pressure on the province next to it, 
and the province next to it, and the province next to it to get their 
taxes into line.
<P>
	I know many people in the business community have spoken in 
favour of a harmonized GST. They have made the argument that it 
would be simpler. The paper work would not be as onerous and all 
that kind of thing. But that is a minor benefit compared to the 
benefit of having competition between different jurisdictions to 
keep taxes low.
<P>
	I do not understand how that was missed by so many groups 
when they talked about harmonizing the GST. To me it just does not 
make any sense.
<P>
	I would encourage people to look at some of the examples not 
only in Canada where we have Alberta with the low tax rates but in 
North America and around the world. When we have low tax rates, 
when we have competition between jurisdictions ultimately it leads 
to lower taxes across the board which means that people have more 
money in their pockets. It means that they have more opportunity 
and they can create their own prosperity for themselves. They are 
not dependent on a government.
<P>
	If there is one thing we have to get rid of in this country it is this 
dependency mentality that governments tend to breed. They tend to
<P>
breed it and ultimately it is to the detriment of the entire country 
and to all of society. We have seen it over and over again, and not 
just limited to Liberal governments. Tory governments have done it 
over and over again as well. They should be ashamed especially 
now that they can see the fruits of their actions of the past where we 
have entire economies becoming dependent on government 
programs.
<P>
	This is a very important aspect that the legislation does not 
address and ignores, the fact that we need some competition 
between different jurisdictions.
<P>
	The fifth point I want to make is that this bill will mean, at least 
in the short run, and I think members have to acknowledge this 
across the way, higher costs for business in Nova Scotia, New 
Brunswick and Newfoundland.
<P>
	I am not going to ask members to take my word for it. I am going 
to ask them to listen to the words of the Retail Council of Canada. 
The Retail Council of Canada is in favour of harmonization. It is in 
favour of it but what it is against is the government's bringing 
harmonization into three provinces and leaving the rest of the 
country unharmonized. They are saying to themselves: ``Why are 
we pushing ahead with tax in pricing in particular when the 
government knows full well that it is going to hurt business in 
Atlantic Canada and if it hurts business it is going to hurt the 
Atlantic Canada economy?'' Of course there is no economy in the 
country that needs help more than Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	Why out of a sort of perverse need to try to fulfil a wonky 
election promise is the government pushing ahead with this when it 
knows it is going to hurt Atlantic Canada?
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	I am not going to ask members to accept my word for it. I am 
going to quote from a letter written on November 29 by the Retail 
Council of Canada which was sent to the current finance minister. 
This letter is rather lengthy so I ask for members' indulgence 
because the points raised are very important: ``Retail council 
provided you with early estimates of the cost attached to tax in 
pricing in July of this year. At about the same time, seven national 
retailers also prepared a paper which explained how tax in pricing 
harmed their operations and provided estimates of the costs they 
faced.
<P>
	``Since then, retail council members have worked to get a clearer 
understanding of the cost impacts. Ten members accounting for 
roughly 30 per cent of Canadian retail sales have given us in 
confidence their detailed estimates of the impacts for their firms.
<P>
	``As the attached chart shows, these companies alone will incur 
annual ongoing costs of almost $34 million. This is only slightly 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7012"> 7012 </A></B>
<P>
offset by input tax credit and other  savings of $6 million, leaving 
these firms with a continuing annual net cost of $28 million''.
<P>
	This is for firms that represent only 30 per cent of the retail 
sector in the three provinces which have recently agreed to 
harmonization. It continues:
<P>
	``Other RCC members have indicated that they will provide 
similar information on their costs to you directly. Nor are these 
costs incurred only by national firms. The expert distribution, 
warehousing and logistics costs incurred by the suppliers to 
independent and small chain retailers will almost certainly be 
passed on given the relatively weak negotiating position of smaller 
firms.
<P>
	``Second, many of their suppliers are located in provinces that 
are not harmonizing so they will not benefit from any 
ITCs''-input tax credits-``in respect to provincial taxes.
<P>
	``Third, small firms that receive prepriced merchandise will 
incur the same reticketing costs as larger regional and national 
retailers. Retailers operating only in the harmonized provinces will 
face one time costs to reprogram their computer systems but will 
not face the same continuing system integration costs that come 
with operating in harmonized and non-harmonized provinces.
<P>
	``As part of the harmonization agreement, the federal 
government facilitated the imposition of capital and payroll taxes. 
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have taken this opportunity to 
introduce new corporate capital taxes as of April 1, 1997, further 
increasing the costs attached to harmonization''.
<P>
	The letter goes on and on but I will not read any more in the 
interest of time. It is fairly clear this is a group that is arguing 
harmonization is a good idea. It wants harmonization but it is 
saying that the government should not go ahead in three provinces 
while it leaves the rest of the country without the harmonized tax. 
The group points out is will cost millions of dollars.
<P>
	It will not cost the businesses millions of dollars ultimately. 
They will pass the costs on. So who pays for it? Consumers. 
Consumers pay through the nose for a broken Liberal government 
promise.
<P>
	It would be bad enough if Canadians in general paid for that 
promise, but it is the people of Atlantic Canada. It is the economy 
that can least afford to take a tax hit of any region in the entire 
country. But the government did not care. It was so desperate to 
save the Deputy Prime Minister's skin that it went ahead and 
pushed through this ridiculous measure and it did not care that it 
cost people in Atlantic Canada jobs. It meant more money out of 
their pockets. It did not care for a moment.
<P>
	The government does not care that it is divisive to the country. 
At a time when we are trying to hold the country together, the 
government gives Canadians one  more reason to be cynical about 
its desire to treat everybody equally.
<P>
	I must ask a question that I am dying to know the answer to. 
Where are the members from Atlantic Canada? Why are they not 
standing up for their constituents? We know there is a grassroots 
revolt in Atlantic Canada against the harmonized GST. Recently 
Greenberg Stores Ltd. announced it was closing a number of stores 
in New Brunswick. It was closing stores in different ridings. It was 
closing stores in Beauséjour, Restigouche-Chaleur, 
Acadie-Bathurst, Fundy-Royal, Moncton and also in Saint John. 
When stores close as a result of government action and 79 people in 
Atlantic Canada are thrown out of work, the MPs from those 
ridings should be on their feet. Where is the defence minister? He 
should be standing up for his constituents. Where is the junior 
minister of agriculture? Why is that minister not standing up for his 
constituents? What about the Conservative member for Saint John? 
We know that they are lock, stock and tomahawk in favour of 
harmonization and they are not standing up for their constituents.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	That lays out how important it is for us to reform this place so 
that MPs have the power to stand up for their constituents. My 
goodness, if that had happened in my province, I would like to 
think that my colleagues would have jumped to their feet and said: 
``This is unacceptable. I do not care if it is my leader who is 
bringing it in. My constituents say it is wrong and I am going to 
stand up for them and vote against it''.
<P>
	Where are they? Where are the Liberal members from Atlantic 
Canada? There are 16,000 names on a petition against this. Where 
are the MPs from Atlantic Canada? Where are those Liberal MPs? 
Why are they not standing up for their people?
<P>
	Their silence speaks eloquently of the need to reform this place. 
It speaks eloquently of the government's insensitivity to Atlantic 
Canada. It speaks volumes about its approach to treating provinces 
differently, as opposed to treating them equally, something the 
Reform Party truly stands for.
<P>
	I am going to conclude my remarks by saying that our party does 
not believe in this approach. It is wrong. The government should 
have fulfilled its promise. It made a promise. It said it would get rid 
of the GST. Its members went door to door and promised it would 
be gone if they were elected. They were elected in spades; 177 seats 
and still the GST sits there as a permanent reminder that 
governments cannot be trusted. People cannot be trusted to come 
through with their promises when they make them on the doorsteps 
during an election campaign. The government should have 
followed through and gotten rid of the GST. That was its 
commitment to voters. The Deputy Prime Minister said so on 
national television. It was said over and over again.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7013"> 7013 </A></B>
<P>
	I do not think the government has listened closely enough and, 
frankly, I do not think a lot of people have listened closely enough 
to the argument that there has to be competition between 
jurisdictions. If we do not, we are entrenching higher taxes. The 
finance minister said it in 1990. That is a very compelling reason 
to vote against a harmonized GST. We have to have competition. 
If we do we can all enjoy lower taxes in this country. However, 
under the current formula, which requires unanimity to lower the 
provincial portion of the GST, that will never happen, as hon. 
members know.
<P>
	Canadians want lower taxes, not different taxes. We are having a 
massive debate in the House about how we are going to change 
taxes. When I go around to doorsteps, when I have my town hall 
meetings in Manyberries, Alberta or in Taber, Brooks or Medicine 
Hat, Suffield or Empress, or wherever, people do not say: ``Boy, I 
wish the taxes were different''. They do say: ``I wish the taxes were 
lower. I wish I could keep more money in my pocket. The 
government gets its share''. It gets 46 per cent of the average 
person's income. ``Then I have to go out and provide my food, 
shelter and clothing for me and my family. There is not much left''. 
There is hardly anything left, which is why we have record high 
levels of personal debt in this country. It is why we have record 
bankruptcies in this country.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	Instead of debating how we are going to change taxes, why not 
have a debate in here about how we can lower taxes? I think 
Canadians have had it with the government having its own agenda 
which simply does not reflect at all what the agenda of Canadians 
is. This bill does nothing to address the overriding concern of 
Canadians that too much of their money is being spent and wasted 
in many cases by the government. They want that money left in 
their pockets.
<P>
	In conclusion, I urge hon. members not only to listen to my 
arguments, I ask them to listen to the arguments of people in the 
provinces where this tax is being harmonized. Opposition parties 
are raising Cain in the various provincial legislatures saying they 
are against it. The Retail Council of Canada, the Canadian Real 
Estate Association, the Halifax Chamber of Commerce and many 
others are pointing out that the way this tax is being introduced is 
going to kill jobs in Atlantic Canada. I cannot believe a government 
that ran on the promise of jobs, jobs, jobs is going to push through 
with this even though it is going to kill jobs in Atlantic Canada. 
This is contrary to common sense.
<P>
	If Liberal MPs in Atlantic Canada will not listen, I ask all 
members to listen to this. Why will they not listen to the people 
who have made it clear that they do not want this tax? There were 
16,000 names on one petition alone. There may be other petitions 
out there but I am only aware of one. There are 16,000 people who 
are opposed to the harmonized GST in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	If the Liberals will not listen to me and my colleagues in the 
Reform Party, then I urge them, especially the Atlantic Canadian 
MPs, to at least listen to their own constituents and vote against this 
bill and to forever forget the idea of introducing a harmonized GST 
across the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with the hon. member for St. Boniface.
<P>
	Bill C-70 is really about re-engineering the Canadian economy. 
We live in very changing times economically. Surely as if we had 
lived back in the 1800s when the horse was replaced by the iron 
horse, today our society is changing dramatically before our very 
eyes.
<P>
	When we talk about Atlantic Canada, for instance in the 
province of Nova Scotia more people today are engaged in 
education than in the fishery and forestry combined. It tells us that 
the nature of our society is changing. We have to change our 
internal and external trade mechanisms because this is becoming a 
very competitive world.
<P>
	The harmonization of the GST is just part and parcel of a general 
program to make our economy much more efficient by stopping the 
duplication of various taxes and the overlap it causes and make our 
economies efficient and competitive as we move toward the 21st 
century.
<P>
	We have talked about the WTO. It was the Atlantic provinces 
when they first came into Confederation back in 1867 that were the 
engines of growth at that time, the creators of wealth and the 
builders of ships. It is to their credit that those provinces have 
realized the importance of a harmonized GST system and of doing 
away with duplication and overlap to create more efficient 
economies for their people which will create jobs in the future.
<P>
	We need a more homogeneous Canadian market, a Canadian 
trading system. This is just part of the parcel to do that.
<P>
	Let me first address the whole concept of provincial sales taxes. 
Each one of our provinces at various times has implemented 
provincial sales taxes. They have come along and changed them, 
applied them to some things in one province and others in another 
province.
<P>
	When I served on the finance committee I travelled to Atlantic 
Canada. I talked to the people about the kinds of administrations 
that existed in the provincial sales tax system. We get the same 
thing in my province of Ontario. It likes to protect children's 
clothing so it is exempted from the PST. Prince Edward Island is 
very concerned about home heating fuel so it is exempted. In other 
words, there is a patchwork of provincial sales taxes and rates 
which go from 12 per cent to 7 per cent and to 0 per cent in Alberta.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7014"> 7014 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	There is a hodge-podge of provincial sales taxes across the 
country. In and of itself what has that created? I am surprised that 
members of the Reform Party who talk about making this a better 
economy cannot see the importance of changing this outmoded 
system of individual provincial sales tax regimes.
<P>
	When I was in the province of Newfoundland I was surprised 
and shocked to find that businesses were complaining about mail 
order businesses which operated out of Ontario and shipped 
products to Newfoundland because the retail sales tax in Ontario 
was less than that in Newfoundland. In other words, somebody 
would not buy something in their own neighbourhood because they 
could buy it cheaper through a mail order business in Ontario 
because of the difference in the provincial sales taxes.
<P>
	These are some of the very basic problems a harmonized system 
is attempting to address. It is long overdue. It is not a matter of 
change for the sake of change. I hear some people say that the 
Liberals just want to change the GST and harmonize the sales tax 
so that they can meet their election commitments. Nothing could be 
further from the truth. This concept of integrating the two taxes is 
very important for our future as a country and for our economic 
well-being.
<P>
	It is very important to have a similar system across the country 
from coast to coast to coast. That is my ideal. Some members of the 
Reform Party will say that we did it in only three provinces. Those 
three provinces are three more than we had a year ago. At this rate 
we will have harmonization across the country in a few years.
<P>
	I would like to talk about the difference between a multistage tax 
and a single stage tax which basically is what the provincial sales 
tax is. The value added tax is a more efficient tax, if the people 
listening believe that there is such a thing as an efficient tax. It is an 
efficient tax in that it taxes at all stages of consumption. The 
provincial sales tax is not efficient for a number of reasons. One 
very real reason is that the provincial sales taxes invariably become 
embedded in manufactured goods. What do I mean by that?
<P>
	I mentioned initially the importance of re-engineering our 
economy, creating a more robust economy in Canada. Another 
aspect is our export sector which has been the engine of growth and 
the engine of employment. Many people come to the industry 
committee week after week and say that to start a small or medium 
size business in Canada they have to start with the assumption that 
70 per cent of their sales will go outside the country. What does that 
have to do with taxes?
<P>
	The bottom line is that with the provincial sales tax system, we 
incorporate and compound the taxes on our export sales because 
there is no mechanism to relieve our  exports of the provincial sales 
tax. The whole concept of the GST or a value added tax is that 
when we export something, we do not include those taxes in the 
export selling price. In other words, it makes our products much 
more competitive in the world environment. I will give an 
example.
<P>
	In my riding even though we do not have a General Motors plant, 
General Motors is a big player in the economy. General Motors 
currently would pay provincial sales tax in its operations. Everyone 
knows there is no such thing as a business tax per se. We hear the 
province of Ontario argue back and forth that it does not want to 
shift the taxes from businesses to individuals. I would like to 
suggest that there is no such thing as business taxes. The only taxes 
are on individuals. We are all paying the tax on a personal basis 
whether it is in that car or the products that we buy daily, our 
telephones, refrigerators and so on. We are all paying the tax. 
Sometimes we see it, sometimes we do not. That is the essence of 
the problem of provincial sales tax.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	It is amazing that members of the Bloc have not noticed that 
their own system is a very efficient one. It is completely 
harmonized with the existing GST system. The automotive sector 
is one of the growing engines of our economy. It is one of the things 
that has kept people employed and has allowed our economy to go 
forward in the last few years. A car produced in Oshawa when sold 
in the United States has PST, provincial sales tax, embedded in the 
selling price but a similar car produced in Ste-Thérèse, Quebec 
does not. All things being equal, the car produced in Ste-Thérèse, 
Quebec and shipped into the American market is cheaper than the 
one produced in Ontario.
<P>
	Everyone can understand why I believe that Ontario and most 
other provinces will eventually harmonize. It is just good business, 
just good sense and just good for the economy.
<P>
	The interesting aspect about this is that moving toward a truly 
harmonized system means that we have a common base, a common 
rate and a single administration. One of the most important things 
is a single administration so that we end the duplication and 
overlap which exists in the system.
<P>
	I would like to mention a person I contacted just this morning, 
Fred Shaw from St. Anthony, Newfoundland. Fred is an 
accountant. In his own practice, because of the harmonization 
process he is actually going to end up charging more on his 
invoices but he said that his customers are going to be a lot better 
off under a harmonized system. The province of Newfoundland is 
going to be better off by millions of dollars by harmonizing its 
administration system.
<P>
	Mr. Shaw talked about buying a load of gravel. Before, he would 
have had to pay the PST and the GST on a  load of gravel but if the 
same truck had spread it over his front lawn he would not have had 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7015"> 7015 </A></B>
<P>
to pay the PST. This is the sort of ridiculous argument we are all 
doing away with under this system.
<P>
	In conclusion the object of a harmonized system is to create a 
more robust engine within Canada and to create a more dynamic 
economy as Canada competes in the 21st century against many 
other competitors that are doing the same thing.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the purpose of our debate today is to take a serious look at this bill, 
to stay away from the political partisanship that arises from time to 
time when discussing these issues and to make a thorough analysis 
based on the following: does this bill provide more benefits for 
business, yes or no?
<P>
	I think our comments should aim to improve instead of simply to 
attack, criticize, denigrate and crush this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I do not want to take up valuable time with further justification 
of a restructured harmonized federal-provincial sales tax. The facts 
have been clearly and convincingly addressed by my colleagues.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The facts are there. What we have to do now is improve this bill 
if we can.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As we all know, the harmonized sales tax will eliminate hidden 
taxes that inflate prices and hurt exports. It is simpler, more 
transparent for consumers and for business, and an integrated 
approach makes possible a lower overall sales tax rate. We know 
that, those are realities. If people do not agree with the facts they 
should attack them and show us why.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We know perfectly well this is a better, more straightforward and 
less costly approach that will help meet the needs of people in a far 
more flexible way.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Today I want to focus on an aspect of this legislation that has too 
often been attacked by those who place partisan politics and narrow 
regionalism ahead of clear objective thought.
<P>
	The issue of course is a decision by the government to provide a 
formula for short term adjustment assistance to provinces when 
they face significant structural cost to participate in the new 
integrated system. That is the prime issue I want to address today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There will be assistance when assistance is necessary. There will 
be a formula that will indicate clearly, fairly and objectively the 
type and amount of assistance the government will provide.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Under this legislation adjustment assistance becomes available 
to provinces which experience a revenue shortfall in excess of 5 per 
cent of their current retail sales tax receipts because they moved to 
a single harmonized sales tax system.
<P>
	For qualifying provinces, in this case Newfoundland, New 
Brunswick and Nova Scotia, the formula means that the federal 
government will provide, and this is very important, first of all, full 
compensation for the revenue shortfall, that is the shortfall over 5 
per cent of the current retail sales tax in year one; that same full 
compensation for the shortfalls in year two; half the amount of the 
shortfall in year three; 25 per cent of the provincial revenue 
shortfall in year four.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Now we have measures that are concrete, specific and fair.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This assistance is a necessary investment in making Canada 
stronger through helping disadvantaged regions move to a modern 
tax to meet modern challenges. It is a 21st century type of 
investment reflecting the fact that government must change how it 
involves itself in economic development.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We see profound changes taking place aross the country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Businesses have made it clear that the best role for government 
is to give firms and workers the environment to compete and that is 
what it is doing with sales tax harmonization, and that is what 
responsible government and leadership means.
<P>
	The assistance formula developed applies equally to all. There is 
no discrimination, no favouritism, no bribery. It is clear, concrete 
and objective. It applies equally to all. Any province that faces a 
transitional revenue loss exceeding 5 per cent because of 
harmonization qualifies for assistance over that amount on a 50-50 
basis. After four years those provinces are on their own.
<P>
	That means that B.C., Alberta and Ontario would not meet the 
threshold. They will not lose money on harmonization, just as 
Quebec did not when it harmonized. In fact, I am told that Quebec 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7016"> 7016 </A></B>
<P>
made money through its staged harmonization approach, that it was 
clever in doing so and it should be commended for that.
<P>
	Not every province has the economic size and scale to become 
instant winners under harmonization. For the three Atlantic 
provinces, with their less developed economies and such problems 
as the fish stocks, harmonization does carry a painful near term 
cost. That is why this government has developed a compensation 
formula and why those governments will receive about $960 
million in assistance.
<P>
	Under the same formula Saskatchewan and Manitoba will also 
deserve assistance. They would be entitled to over $550 million for 
the four year period when they decide to harmonize, a fact that is 
not propagated loudly or widely by either of those governments. I 
want to mention that under the same formula Saskatchewan and 
Manitoba would also deserve assistance. They would be entitled to 
over $550 million for the four year period when they decide to 
harmonize.
<P>
	It is surprising and to some frustrating that this government's 
approach has been turned into a political football. There is a tragic 
cynicism at work, the type of cynicism that knows the price of 
everything and the value of nothing. ``Let's do what we can in order 
to enhance our popularity which is plummeting, and let's do 
whatever in order to noticed''.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	Who can argue the value of helping provinces provide the 
environment to industry that would help them fly? It is not just one 
or two sectors but all businesses in a region. This is particularly 
true for the Atlantic region which is why it has moved to accept the 
harmonized approach.
<P>
	By what illogical leap can it be suggested that because the 
Atlantic provinces or Manitoba or Saskatchewan qualify for 
assistance, equal financial benefits should be provided by 
provinces that do not suffer major losses?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	How can anyone rationalize such an approach? What kind of 
approach do they want when they say we should not distribute 
wealth according to the needs of a province or a region?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is not a prescription for fairness. If we do not share in a way 
that responds to needs and loss it is a premise for selfishness. 
Statistical uniformity in no way builds economic futures or 
preserves a vibrant Canadian society. One size does not fit all in a 
nation as diverse as Canada. It never has and I do not think any 
provincial politician in their heart of hearts believes any different.
<P>
	For example, Quebec and Ontario are the major beneficiaries of 
our federal tax regime for research and development, the most 
beneficial in the G-7. Do those governments want these credits to 
be proportioned on the basis of geography rather than economic 
reality? I think not.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	No, certainly not. So why, when we are looking at another 
program, do they want the same? Is this not a contradiction? Is it 
not unfair and insensitive? I think so.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is the heart of the issue and the key to fairness. Government 
assistance should be determined by the principles of need and 
performance. That is the way to be effective. That is the way to be 
cost efficient and that is the way to build a 21st century economy.
<P>
	Let me repeat this is not a political issue, or it need not be. It is 
not an accounting debate. Rather, it is a question of Canada's 
economy today and into the next century. Sales tax harmonization 
is a solution that gives Canada's affected provinces an effective, 
more fair and competitive tax.
<P>
	Our challenges are too pressing, our opportunities too real to 
squander on petty partisan politics. Let us get on with looking at the 
issues clearly rather than applying emotional blinkers or dog in the 
manger logic or simply saying something in order to help the 
party's flagging popularity.
<P>
	Yes, our approach and assistance will make the maritimes more 
competitive. Any province can seize a clear and concrete solution 
to the problem by getting onboard themselves. The solution does 
not involve a dramatic fiscal cost. They will benefit quickly and 
surely through greater competitiveness and real cost savings to 
their businesses. That should be carrot enough and reward in full.
<P>
	There are provinces like those in the Atlantic region. They want 
to make the transformation but face a tough short term downside. 
That is a barrier they cannot overcome by themselves so we have 
developed a cost shared short term solution to help them over the 
hump. That is the essence of partnership and of real national 
leadership.
<P>
	Different players bring to the table different problems and 
different resources. By working together, drawing on our strengths 
and compensating for our weaknesses we all emerge stronger. The 
strength of a value added sales tax regime is that it is a better tax for 
today's economy.
<P>
	For Canada's place in that economy we face the problem that its 
advantages have not been fully harmonized with provincial-federal 
taxes. If we work together through the format and approach our 
government has set up, the result will be a tax system that makes us 
stronger, that helps deliver more jobs and that is fairer to us all.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
given the opposition of the Retail Council of Canada and many 
independent retailers to this deal, precisely because it is being 
brought into only one region, and they point out that it will mean 
higher costs for them and ultimately for consumers, and knowing 
the impact on Atlantic Canada will be especially difficult to deal 
with given the state of its economy, how can the member justify 
pushing for this deal when he knows it will hurt consumers in 
Atlantic Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question. I know that he takes these questions seriously.
<P>
	I thought I had shown quite clearly in my address that this was as 
fair an approach as could be found. I have not heard one political 
party, not one politician, come forward with something that is more 
sensitive or sensible which responds to the needs that have been 
articulated. I am befuddled.
<P>
	I suspect he probably has another question. Surely he listened to 
what I said. I said let there be no doubt that all systems are 
imperfect. Let there be no doubt that this has imperfections, but let 
me see something that is better, let me see something that will 
respond more significantly to the needs of Atlantic and other 
Canadians.
<P>
	The major point here is that it treats Canadians fairly. The 
opportunities that were given to the Atlantic provinces are also 
available to Manitoba and Saskatchewan. There is a formula. It is 
not discrimination. It is not biased.
<P>
	Of course, when one talks about taxes in general we are not 
going to find a whole lot of people who are going to agree with any 
level of taxation or any adjustments to the taxation system. Clearly 
what we have now is not efficient. Clearly what is being proposed 
here is much better. It is much more sensitive. It is much more 
workable.
<P>
	Surely if my colleague has another option, he or his party will 
put it forward and then we will let people look at it and decide 
which of the two options is better.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is necessary to make the point right now to the hon. 
member that the Reform Party, as much as it should be, is not the 
Government of Canada. Therefore it is not up to us to put forward 
options for this particular tax. Certainly during the election 
campaign we will be putting forward options on a whole range of 
issues so that Canadians can choose between the various parties 
and their platforms.
<P>
	In this particular case, given that the hon. member and his party 
campaigned during the 1993 election campaign on scrapping, 
abolishing, doing away with the GST, how can he reconcile that 
with the present plan to harmonize it? How can he reconcile 
harmonization with the promises that were made by him and his 
party during the 1993 election campaign?
<P>
	He states what is fair. What is fair to the Canadian people is for 
the government to live up to its election promises.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Indeed, Madam Speaker. My colleague has no 
doubt seen an accounting by the Prime Minister of Canada with 
respect to the promises made on the electoral platform. The 
majority of those promises have been honoured.
<P>
	My hon. colleague who asked the question knows full well that 
setting aside the GST was one of a number of options. 
Harmonization was in the electoral platform. My colleague knows 
that. My colleague is intentionally trying to make it an issue when 
it is not. Why would my colleague not read the relevant sections 
into the record? Harmonization was clearly an option. 
Harmonization was mentioned on a number of occasions. My 
colleague knows that.
<P>
	The other thing that I find extremely strange is, as I understand 
it, every party in the House of Commons is in favour of 
harmonization. Every single party. If I am wrong, let them stand up 
and say so. As I understand it, businesses are in favour of 
harmonization. Yes, there is additional work that needs to be done. 
Yes, the systems need to be fine tuned. However, let them stand up 
and be counted. Let us have no more rhetoric. Let us look at this 
initiative as it is intended to be, to make the system fairer, simpler 
and less costly. Let us look at it from that perspective.

	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the remarks of my colleague opposite, and 
I would like to say that the bill is nothing more, in the opinion of 
the Bloc, than a collection of amendments to the GST.
<P>
	In addition to several dozen small technical changes on 
exemptions from payment of the GST, there are a series of 
amendments providing for the harmonization of the GST with the 
sales taxes of the three maritime provinces. In Bill C-70, the GST 
becomes a harmonized sales tax, as the Minister of Finance 
describes it.
<P>
	The bill also provides an exemption from federal sales tax, and 
this applies right across the country, for books bought by public 
libraries, schools, colleges, universities and other organizations 
involved in literacy programs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7018"> 7018 </A></B>
<P>
	We received this bill at the last minute and we in the official 
opposition deplore the way the Minister of Finance tabled these 
documents. The official opposition had less than 24 hours to 
examine the text of a bill of over 300 pages, which came without 
any explanatory notes. In this way, the government is trying to 
avoid debate and to keep the real issues hidden from the people 
of Canada.
<P>
	The Liberals do not keep their promises, to say the least. The 
Deputy Prime Minister should resign again. The GST is with us for 
the duration, as Bill C-70 pointedly indicates. The Prime Minister 
promised transparency in the last election campaign. The Liberals 
are doing now what they criticized the Conservatives for doing in 
the past. The new GST is a hidden tax, because it is buried in the 
selling price of goods and services.
<P>
	The 1994 Liberal majority report stated that it would simply be 
wrong to keep Canadians in the dark as to what they were paying in 
taxes to their governments, and a hidden tax would make it difficult 
for them to force the government to account for the way taxes are 
collected and, to a lesser extent, for the way public funds are spent.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance is today presenting us with the hidden 
tax he criticized at the time. Furthermore, in 1989, the dissenting 
report of the minority Liberal opposition stated: ``In addition, if the 
GST is hidden in the selling price, it will be much easier for the 
government to increase it later on''.
<P>
	The old Liberal federal sales tax was hidden in the price. The 
Conservatives made it visible by creating the GST as we know it. 
With the proposed agreement with the maritimes before us today, 
the Liberals are again hiding this much hated tax. There is always 
this double talk: They say one thing when in opposition and another 
when in office.
<P>
	In 1989, the Liberals tore out their hair over this issue, but now 
that they are in office, they are hiding the GST as if nothing had 
happened, as if this tax had never existed.
<P>
	This is a disgrace. This shows selective memory. The Liberals 
boast about listening to businesses. But when the Canadian 
Chamber of Commerce surveyed its members in 1994, it concluded 
that 70 per cent of Canadian businesses were against hiding this 
tax. In February 1996, the same organization surveyed its members 
again, only to find again that 76 per cent of them were against 
hiding this tax. For a government that boasts about listening to 
business, it does not seem to be listening very well.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	Let us take a look at the compensation formula, which is in fact a 
$1 billion political present. But the real cost is that of harmonizing 
with the maritime provinces.
<P>
	In a shameless exercise in window dressing, the Minister of 
Finance has paid off the maritimes so that  they would help him 
honour an election promise that had not been acted on. One billion 
dollars is what Quebecers and Canadians from the other provinces 
will have to pay for an election promise that was not kept by the 
Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister. One billion dollars is 
what this measure is really costing us.
<P>
	There is no mention of the compensation formula in Bill C-70. 
The MOUs provided for some $961 million in compensation. We 
are still waiting for the Minister of Finance to unveil the criteria for 
his compensation package and to clearly show that Quebec is not 
entitled to such compensation.
<P>
	In spite of Quebec's repeated requests to that effect, the federal 
government has turned a deaf ear. The objective is always the 
same: to penalize Quebec and particularly Quebecers, who elected 
a sovereignist government. This compensation may be a political 
gift to make the Liberal UI reform, which adversely affects 
seasonal workers in the maritimes, more palatable to the 
population of these provinces. Otherwise, why would Ontario, 
Quebec and the other provinces not be entitled to such 
compensation for harmonizing their sales tax with the federal one?
<P>
	This cost of $1 billion over the next four years will be largely 
exceeded. The result of reducing the tax base at the consumer's 
level from 19 per cent down to 15 per cent will be that, in future, 
Quebecers and Canadians from the other provinces will have to pay 
more equalization to the maritimes.
<P>
	These additional equalization costs will be paid by all taxpayers 
in Canada and Quebec. The commitment made by the finance 
minister to the governments of the maritime provinces is not 
acceptable, when you compare the cushy deal reached with the 
maritime provinces on harmonization with what happened in 
Quebec in recent years.
<P>
	The agreement reached by the federal government and the three 
maritime provinces will eventually be expanded to include all 
Canadian provinces. At the present time, the majority of Canadians 
are against the minister's plan, against the introduction of a single 
15 per cent tax, to be collected by the Canadian revenue 
commission the government wants to set up.
<P>
	The tax burden would thus increase in Quebec, in Ontario, and in 
several other Canadian provinces. Bill C-70 will have a number of 
consequences for Quebec. For many years now, the Government of 
Quebec has made a genuine effort to harmonize federal and 
provincial tax bases. Quebec collects and administers for the 
federal government the GST such as we now know it in Quebec. 
We have therefore worked very hard in Quebec to bring about this 
harmonization at no cost to other Canadians.
<P>
	This bill is unfair to Quebec on more than one count. Quebec's 
fiscal autonomy would be undermined by the  Canadian revenue 
commission, which would be responsible for administering the 
new 15 per cent GST. The present harmonization worked out 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7019"> 7019 </A></B>
<P>
between Quebec and Ottawa is therefore a far cry from the minister 
of finance's bill, whatever the Liberals might say.
<P>
	Quebec will never agree to take part in such a fiscal regime. This 
new attempt by the federal government to interfere in provincial 
jurisdiction must be denounced.
<P>
	Far from harmonizing federal and provincial sales taxes, this bill 
stands a good chance of jeopardizing several years of efforts by 
Quebec to achieve harmonization with federal taxation. The 
existing harmonization in Quebec was accomplished with the 
consent of both parties, and in all good will.
<P>
	Today, the Minister of Finance is scrapping all the agreements 
signed with Quebec and trying to replace them with a bill that is 
nothing more than a pre-election ploy.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	The government has made only partial use of a measure 
proposed by the Bloc Quebecois, so the public ends up with a 
half-victory. In our opinion, however, even with this GST credit on 
books, the government is not going far enough.
<P>
	Ever since Quebec introduced the QST, all books have been 
exempt from the provincial sales tax, and not just those purchased 
by literacy institutions, schools, public libraries and so on. All 
books are QST exempt, including those purchased by consumers in 
bookstores, which represent the bulk of GST revenues on book 
sales.
<P>
	The measure announced by the Minister of Finance is, therefore, 
a cosmetic one, designed merely to enable the Liberals to boast that 
they have eliminated the GST on books, when in fact they have not 
done anything of the sort. Taxing books means taxing knowledge, 
making it even less accessible to certain members of society.
<P>
	This does, however, represent a half-victory for the Bloc 
Quebecois and for the public, in that we have been battling from 
the very beginning, even as far back as when the Conservatives 
were in power, to eliminate the tax on books. For this to become a 
total victory, however, all books would have to be exempted from 
this GST disguised as a harmonized sales tax, not just books bought 
by literacy and educational organizations.
<P>
	What the Liberals are aiming at with Bill C-70 is, in fact, nothing 
more than a whitewash, a diversionary tactic, at which they are 
experts, and which is what has kept them in power for so many 
years. The moment of truth is at hand. They will have to answer to 
the Canadian public in the next election. Then their poor track 
record will speak for itself.
<P>
	Rather than passing this bill, the Bloc Quebecois proposes a 
concrete revision of the corporate taxation system. According to 
our analysis, the federal  government could recover up to $3 billion 
annually by revising or abolishing certain outmoded, inefficient 
and unfair tax expenditures, using the money instead to encourage 
businesses to create jobs.
<P>
	In today's struggling labour market, the purpose of corporate 
taxation ought to be to encourage the creation of good, lasting jobs, 
while ensuring that the funding of public services is equitably 
divided between corporations and individuals, and among the 
corporations themselves.
<P>
	A number of analysts see a problem in the way taxes are 
collected in Canada: While the tax rate on profits is lower than 
elsewhere in the world, capital and payroll taxes are higher. This 
discourages job creation. Instead of remedying this situation, the 
Liberal government is attempting to hide yet another broken 
election promise. What a poor record the Liberals have to show for 
themselves after three years in power.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened with interest to the 
comments of the hon. member opposite and, as usual, there was the 
litany of complaints. But he did allude to the fact that of course 
Quebec has a harmonized tax. I would like him to tell this House 
whether that is an improvement over the situation which prevailed 
previously when there was a separate Quebec sales tax and a 
federal GST.
<P>
	Is the hon. member supportive of harmonization as it has been 
working in Quebec and, if so, why would he deny the same 
opportunity to other regions of the country?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélisle: </B>Madam Speaker, I can inform the parliamentary 
secretary that yes, I strongly support harmonization as 
implemented in Quebec. What I want to say today, before this 
House, is that Quebec received no compensation for its efforts to 
put together a harmonized federal and provincial sales tax.
<P>
	Why has the federal government committed nearly $1 billion in 
compensation for the three maritime provinces, the plan we are 
discussing today, while Quebec is not entitled to any 
compensation? I deplore this double standard.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	It is the same old story. In the end, the federal government is 
trying to make amends for its new employment insurance policy.
<P>
	In the three maritime provinces, there are many seasonal 
workers who will be penalized. The government is providing a 
disguised subsidy of nearly $1 billion just before a federal election 
is called, in an attempt to make its employment insurance policy 
more palatable to the maritimes and make seasonal workers in 
these three provinces forget they have been penalized. They want to  

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7020"> 7020 </A></B>
<P>
make them forget about that before the next federal election. That 
is what I find intolerable.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Madam Speaker, Quebec did not receive 
compensation at the time that it harmonized. It would not qualify 
for compensation under the formula that was announced, debated 
and passed by this House several months ago.
<P>
	That formula requires a province to incur a net loss of tax 
revenues of over 5 per cent in order to qualify for assistance on any 
measure. Quebec would not be in a position to benefit from that 
formula, nor might I add would Ontario were it to harmonize now 
or British Columbia. Other provinces would qualify. The maritimes 
do quality and that is the simple answer.
<P>
	Not only did the province of Quebec not lose revenue on 
harmonizing in the manner in which it did several years ago, but in 
fact gained revenue by operating two systems simultaneously for a 
period of time. I wonder if the hon. member is aware of that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélisle:</B> Madam Speaker, I can inform the parliamentary 
secretary that I know all that. They say that according to the 
formula that was approved, Quebec and Ontario are not entitled to 
compensation, but what is particularly galling is that 25 per cent or 
about $250 million of the $961 million in compensation being 
granted today to the three maritime provinces will be paid for by 
taxpayers in Quebec. I think this is something we and Quebec 
taxpayers cannot accept.
<P>
	In addition, the equalization formula will be modified, which 
will also affect the three maritime provinces that will get this 
compensation. In the end, these three provinces will not be getting 
$1 billion and Quebec taxpayers will not be paying $250 million. It 
will be a much larger amount. That is what the people of Quebec 
refuse to go along with and that is the point I wanted to make today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a 
great pleasure for me to join this debate on Bill C-70. It is the act 
that will harmonize the GST and the sales taxes in the Atlantic 
provinces.
<P>
	As members are aware, one of the government's objectives is to 
have a fully harmonized sales tax system across Canada. Bill C-70, 
dealing with Atlantic provinces only, takes us significantly closer 
to that goal.
<P>
	Harmonization is a first step toward replacing the GST with a 
truly national sales tax system. The bill provides for a single 
harmonized or combined value added tax called the harmonized 
sales tax, or HST, to replace the current retail sales taxes in Nova 
Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador and the 
federal GST in those provinces on April 1, 1997. On that date the 
three  Atlantic provinces will have a simpler, less costly and more 
efficient sales tax system.
<P>
	I should mention that this bill by no means diminishes the 
government's commitment to working with the remaining 
provinces to make this a single harmonized sales tax system for 
Canada. I urge the people of Ontario to follow this debate very 
closely because harmonization in the Atlantic provinces will give 
those provinces a clear competitive advantage over Ontario which 
is not at the present time moving toward harmonization.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	In addition to replacing the current system, the harmonized sales 
tax will reduce the current combined sales tax rates to 15 per cent 
in the Atlantic provinces, will establish a single administration of 
both federal and provincial sales taxes, introduce tax inclusive 
pricing so that consumers will know exactly what they are paying 
in advance and ensure a level playing field for businesses in the 
participating provinces.
<P>
	The new combined sales tax and GST rate of 15 per cent, for 
example, in the province of Newfoundland is a reduction of 
somewhere between 4 per cent and 5 per cent of the current total 
taxes paid by the people in that province.
<P>
	Businesses in the three provinces should be particularly pleased 
with having to deal with only one tax, one set of forms, one 
administration, one rate and one base instead of two of everything 
as is the case now. This is particularly important for very small 
businesses which simply lack the staff to deal with multiple levels 
of taxation.
<P>
	Under the current provincial retail tax system all businesses pay 
tax on the goods and services they purchase to operate their 
businesses. These taxes are hidden in the final price of all goods 
and services sold in the provinces so prices are inflated by several 
layers of provincial sales tax. The new harmonized sales tax will 
eliminate these hidden taxes by allowing businesses to claim an 
input tax credit for sales taxes paid on goods and services 
purchased to make their products and run their operations.
<P>
	Businesses in the three Atlantic provinces now pay over $700 
million in hidden sales taxes to their provincial governments. 
Eliminating these hidden taxes will mean that the cost of 
manufacturing, wholesaling and retailing will come down, making 
prices in those provinces more competitive.
<P>
	Exports from those provinces should strengthen because goods 
produced in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and 
Labrador will no longer have hidden taxes embedded in their prices 
when they are shipped abroad. This could also be true in the 
province of Ontario if the Queen's Park government would move 
toward harmonizing the GST and the provincial sales tax.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7021"> 7021 </A></B>
<P>
	This change is not an abstract, accountant based benefit. Canada 
is a trading nation with about one-third of its economy currently 
dependent on exports. Just as important, it is the export sector that 
has been creating the new jobs over the past few years. Therefore, 
it is vital that our exports be as competitive as possible.
<P>
	It is not only exports that will gain under the new harmonized 
sales tax. Removing the currently buried taxes will mean that 
goods produced in the Atlantic provinces will be more competitive 
than goods imported into those provinces. Lower prices will be a 
greater incentive to buy items made at home by workers in the 
participating three provinces.
<P>
	I would also like to mention that the system of input tax credits 
will also help to combat the underground economy. With input tax 
credits available at the 15 per cent harmonized tax rate, instead of 
covering only the current 7 per cent GST, there will be a 
substantially increased incentive for businesses to operate within 
the sales tax system rather than outside it.
<P>
	I mentioned before that businesses in the participating provinces 
will deal with a single tax administration under the new 
harmonized sales tax. At the moment businesses are faced with two 
separate sales tax systems, two sets of forms and two sets of 
auditors. Businesses, and in particular small businesses which now 
deal with two or more separate sales tax systems on a daily basis, 
will save because of the reduced compliance burden. This could 
also be true in Ontario if it moved to harmonize the GST and sales 
tax.
<P>
	One sales tax system means less time and money spent on 
paperwork. Small businesses, the micro businesses, with less than 
$30,000 in taxable sales, will not even have to register for either the 
federal or the provincial sales tax in the maritimes.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Also helpful will be the fact that businesses currently registered 
for the GST will automatically be registered for the new tax. 
Registrants will continue to use the current GST return to calculate 
net tax remittances.
<P>
	When reporting tax collected and remitted and input tax credits 
claimed, there will be no need to separately identify the federal and 
provincial components of the harmonized sales tax at the 15 per 
cent rate or tax collected or payable at the 7 per cent rate. It will be 
much less complicated.
<P>
	There is clear evidence also that businesses will pass on savings 
in the form of lower prices in the competitive marketplace. Past 
studies in Canada and in other countries show that when sales taxes 
are replaced with value added taxes, savings are passed on to 
consumers. This helps to refute some critics of the harmonized 
sales tax who claim that harmonization will hurt low income 
earners more than high income earners because of  increased taxes 
on basic necessities like home heating fuel and clothing.
<P>
	The cost of goods should actually decrease because of the lower 
combined tax rate and the removal of the hidden provincial retail 
sales tax already included in the price of those goods.
<P>
	One issue of concern to retailers under the new harmonized sales 
tax is tax inclusive pricing, which is the answer to consumers 
wanting to know the total tax included price in advance of their 
purchases. This is a matter of including taxes in the price listed in 
the supermarket or wherever. The government's objective in this 
respect is to ensure transparency. The tax will be clearly shown on 
receipts.
<P>
	Retailers have expressed concern that tax inclusive pricing will 
cost them money, make them less competitive and result in higher 
prices. The rules are flexible enough to minimize competitive 
inequities since businesses will have the option of displaying tax 
excluded prices alongside tax included pricing.
<P>
	On April 1, 1997 the three Atlantic provinces will have a 
simpler, less costly and more efficient sales tax system. I hope that 
the other provinces, including Ontario, will soon follow suit. I urge 
all my colleagues in the House to support Bill C-70.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, the member 
opposite suggests that making it easier to pay taxes somehow 
makes it more attractive, something like turning vinegar into wine.
<P>
	Why should retailers or anyone else feel better about paying this 
tax?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Adams:</B> Madam Speaker, one thing about the harmonization 
process we are going through, which has already taken place in the 
province of Quebec, is that it simplifies and cheapens tax 
collection. Like the member, I do not like paying taxes, but I 
certainly do not like paying taxes unnecessarily to have my taxes 
collected, which is the situation now.
<P>
	Where there is a sales tax and a GST there are two sets of tax 
collectors, two sets of forms, different dates for submission of the 
taxes. All of that costs money. As a result, the amount of tax being 
paid is greater. I believe that a simpler, harmonized tax system that 
lowers the tax we pay is better than the current complicated and 
expensive tax system.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-70 which amends 
a number of acts but, most important, provides for the 
implementation of agreements between the federal government and 
the governments of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and 
Newfoundland and Labrador to harmonize the federal and 
provincial sales taxes effective April 1, 1997.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7022"> 7022 </A></B>
<P>
	This legislation is an important step in our election promise 
regarding the GST. Let me remind the House, especially members 
of the Reform Party, of our promise. The red book states: ``A 
Liberal government will replace the GST with a system that 
generates equivalent revenues, is fair to consumers and to small 
business, minimizes disruption to small business and promotes 
federal-provincial co-operation and harmonization''.
<P>
	This is the promise that I made to the people of 
Guelph-Wellington in the fall of 1993 and it is a promise that I 
look forward to seeing to its completion right across Canada.
<P>
	We promised to replace the GST with a system that generates 
equivalent revenues. At a time when the people of 
Guelph-Wellington are demanding fiscal responsibility and 
restraint from their federal government it is important not to 
overlook the $18 billion that is currently raised by the GST. Any 
realistic Canadian knows that we cannot continue to provide social 
programs, reduce the deficit and care for our people without 
revenue.
<P>
	It is also important to note that all net revenue from the GST is 
deposited into the debt servicing and reduction account. This 
means that all moneys generated by the GST go to fight the deficit. 
We have had a clear picture from Canadians of what they want us to 
do with the deficit.
<P>
	We promised to replace the GST with a system that is fair to 
consumers and to small business. The cry for tax fairness is loud 
and clear in Guelph-Wellington. My constituents do not mind 
paying their fair share, but they want a tax system which distributes 
the burden.
<P>
	We know that the Standing Committee on Finance worked long 
and hard to find alternatives to the GST. I congratulate my 
colleagues on the committee for their work. As a relative 
newcomer to the committee, I appreciate the long hours that 
members faced in looking for an alternative to the GST. The result 
of this work was the national VAT, and its recommendations are 
seen in the agreements signed between the federal government and 
the governments of the three Atlantic provinces.
<P>
	The recommendations of the committee received an important 
endorsement, one which I would like to remind the House of: ``It is 
simply unacceptable that Canada remains the only country in the 
world with ten different sales tax regimes''. This person went on to 
say: ``We commend the government on its attempt to harmonize 
the tax with the provinces''. That endorsement came from the 
Reform Party in June of 1994. I look forward to its support of this 
legislation.
<P>
	We promised an alternative to the GST which would minimize 
disruption to small business. I polled small business in 
Guelph-Wellington in November of 1994 on this issue. Sixty-four 
per cent of respondents said they  believed that a harmonized VAT 
would be simpler and more fair.
<P>
	I asked business people in my riding because they are directly 
affected by changes to the GST. They know that a harmonized sales 
tax is good for business. Businesses must currently pay two 
separate taxes and deal with two separate bureaucracies.
<P>
	The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants estimates that 
harmonization will save businesses between $400 million and $700 
million annually.
<P>
	The idea of harmonization received another important 
endorsement in June of 1994. Let me remind the House of what this 
person had to say: ``I want something that works. And I'll tell you 
this, that if we had one VAT, one base, one bureaucracy to collect it, 
the manufacturers and the businesses of Ontario would save over a 
billion dollars by being able to deduct those costs that you cannot 
deduct today on the sales tax''. This person went on to say: ``It has 
been one of the areas of major competitive disadvantages that 
Ontario manufacturers have had and Ontario businesses have had, 
and I say stop the rhetoric, stop the politics, stop the finger 
pointing. Get on with harmonization and simplification of the GST, 
or whatever the new initials are, and the PST''.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	That endorsement comes from Mike Harris, then the leader of 
the third party in Ontario and now premier of the province. I look 
forward to his support for a harmonized sales tax in Ontario.
<P>
	We promised an alternative to the GST that promotes 
federal-provincial co-operation and harmonization. I have said in 
this House before that my constituents are tired of governments 
that blame other levels of government. They want us to work 
together with all our partners for their betterment and to secure a 
better future for Canada.
<P>
	They are proud of our Team Canada approach to international 
trade and they want to see that approach in solving all our 
problems. Bill C-70 is an important step in a Team Canada type 
effort in sales tax harmonization.
<P>
	The efforts that have resulted in this legislation were not easy. It 
is important to remember that the Standing Committee on Finance 
reviewed suggestions and comments from over 1,200 individuals 
and representatives from various associations. They rejected many 
suggestions because they did not generate the revenue they needed 
or because they were simply unworkable.
<P>
	I believe that the proposals that we are debating today go a long 
way in fulfilling our promise. Our country continues to face serious 
problems. It is simply irresponsible for this government to abandon 
its deficit reduction efforts by ignoring the revenues generated by 
the GST. Nor did we promise to do so.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7023"> 7023 </A></B>
<P>
	Deficit reduction and our future remain our priority. In doing 
so, we are fulfilling another important promise, to generate and 
create opportunity and in doing so creating hope and growth for 
our country.
<P>
	We made a promise to replace the GST. Reformers, on the other 
hand, promised to keep it as it is until the deficit was eliminated. 
We know that their deficit reduction target seems not to matter to 
them any more. Irresponsible tax cuts and more spending are 
election promises that Canadians will be hearing from Reformers. 
Deficit reduction, promise keeping and sound administration is 
what Canadians are seeing from this Liberal government.
<P>
	This is important legislation. When it passes, Canadians living in 
New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador will 
save time and energy for their businesses. They will have a tax that 
is better for consumers and they will have promoted federal and 
provincial co-operation.
<P>
	The premier of Ontario, Mike Harris, said in opposition: ``Stop 
the rhetoric, stop the politics, stop the finger pointing. Get on with 
harmonization and simplification''.
<P>
	We have taken his advice in Atlantic Canada at least. This 
legislation deserves our support.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate hearing the member speak on this issue. I have to smile 
a little when she talks about the keeping of promises. That is 
getting to be a joke to the people across Canada in terms of what 
the Liberals have done.
<P>
	I would like the member to comment on a statement that was 
made in 1994 by the then revenue minister from Vancouver, now 
the transport minister, who predicted that voters will punish any 
provincial government that fails to merge its sales tax with a 
revamped goods and services tax. If that would be the case I 
wonder if this member can tell me why the results in P.E.I. recently.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Madam Speaker, first, I am very glad I 
made the member smile. As we know, newspapers say that 
Reformers do not smile very often. So I am very happy to have 
helped him along today.
<P>
	I also would like to say that I think the reality of this initiative is 
something like our health care initiative. The reality is that 
particular initiative across Canada had to start in two or three 
provinces. The GST is being implemented in the same way in two 
or three provinces. As we move across Canada we will eventually 
have a GST in place that will help the retailers an awful lot.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	The reality of this is reflected in a poll I conducted in early 1994. 
My retailers told me very loudly and clearly that it was very 
important to have a tax at the end of the sale that is not visible. The 
retailers originally asked the Conservative government 10 years 
ago to make the tax visible. They have since come forward to the 
finance committee and admitted they made a very serious error, 
that it has really hurt the growth, the competitiveness and the 
buying patterns of all Canadians. That is what we are hoping to 
achieve with this change.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Madam Speaker, there is one nice thing about 
asking a question in Government Orders as opposed to question 
period. In question period we do not get a second chance. I did not 
hear the member make any comments with regard to the voters 
punishing the government that will not go along with this. The 
voters in P.E.I. sent a very loud message that they are not 
interested. Could the member comment on the results of the P.E.I. 
election?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Madam Speaker, in reality, as I said in my 
speech, if the member was listening, we have to look toward the 
provinces co-operating. We also need a solution that is proper for 
each province. At this time P.E.I. has decided to have a second 
look, which is fine. We have to work together in harmony although 
I know the Reform Party has difficulty with that. But we will take 
our time, we will go slowly and we will do it right.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the Minister of Finance has asked this House to approve 
the blended tax deal he has made with the Atlantic provinces. The 
Reform Party opposes this legislation on several grounds.
<P>
	First, it does not fulfil the election promise to kill the GST. The 
red book fine print may have hedged on this issue but the 
impression left with the public was quite clear. The Liberal Party 
had been in a historic fight with the Conservative government's 
Brian Mulroney against the GST. With such a fight under its belt, it 
would use the opportunity of being in office to scrap the hated tax. 
The resignation of the Deputy Prime Minister and the 
parliamentary protest actions of the members for York 
South-Weston and Broadview-Greenwood support this view.
<P>
	Second, the blended tax deal comes with too high a price tag for 
the rest of Canada. Why should taxpayers outside the Atlantic 
provinces pay nearly $1 billion to the governments of those 
provinces which have voluntarily agreed to go along with the 
federal government's plan? They have no moral right to be 
compensated for an action which was essentially voluntary. It is 
quite clear that the transfer was a political bribe by the federal 
government so that it could pretend that it had begun to deliver on 
its election promise to scrap the tax.
<P>
	Third, the blended tax does nothing to get rid of the fundamental 
flaws of the GST system as enacted by the Mulroney government.
<P>
	As an economist, I was a strong supporter of the policy that 
would replace the manufacturer's excise tax by a  value added tax. 
The latter promised to eliminate the cascading of taxes, distortions 
between industry's prices, be good for exports and leave a paper 
trail that discourages tax evasion. However, the value added tax 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7024"> 7024 </A></B>
<P>
which eventually emerged from the Conservative's deliberations as 
the GST fell far short of the ideal found in academic studies of such 
a tax.
<P>
	The most serious problem stems from the failure to apply the tax 
to the broadest base possible. Once the political decision to exclude 
food had been reached, a Pandora's box of other exemptions and 
so-called zero rating became subject to successful political 
lobbying.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	The result is a special treatment of the so-called MUSH sector 
covering municipalities, universities, schools and hospitals which 
are exempted from the tax. Doctors and professionals are zero rated 
which means that they do not charge the GST, but they do not get a 
rebate on the GST they paid on the materials they bought while 
providing their services.
<P>
	Hearings by the finance committee produced many stories about 
the nightmarish complexity and administrative costs of the GST in 
general. These stories went from the inequity of having five 
doughnuts taxed because they are assumed to embody food service 
delivery, while six doughnuts are not taxed since they are pure 
food, to the false incentives implicit in the taxation of garbage 
collection services delivered by a private firm and non-taxation of 
municipal garbage collection services. Imagine what that does to 
the privatization of the often much more costly municipal garbage 
collection services.
<P>
	From evidence produced by the witnesses, it is clear that the 
GST did not discourage but encouraged tax evasion. Firms in 
construction, in home, shoe and automobile repairs and a variety of 
other service industries that pay the GST face serious competition 
from many that do not. In addition, participants in the scam to 
defraud the GST are alleged also to be avoiding paying income tax.
<P>
	One of the most dramatic presentations was by a witness who 
owned a business selling used goods. The GST has virtually 
bankrupted him primarily because of competition from used goods 
dealers that do not charge the GST. Similar stories were told by 
legitimate dealers in used cars. The notional GST return on used 
goods did not prevent the erosion of the nationally important 
legitimate trade in used goods and automobiles.
<P>
	The paperwork involved in paying the tax and claiming rebates 
is very significant. For larger firms the day to day operations have 
reached a reasonable level of cost as a result of the intensive use of 
computers. For small businesses the cost remains high in spite of 
the government's willingness to accommodate the special needs of 
such firms.
<P>
	In sum, all of these costs and false incentives of the Canadian 
GST system still affect the blended tax. In some ways they have 
become worse because of the need to integrate the provincial sales 
tax with the GST. The rates are higher, the incentives to evade are 
larger and so on.
<P>
	Fourth therefore are the inequities resulting from the 
harmonization of the sales tax of individual provinces with each 
other and the GST. This harmonization produced a number of 
inequities.
<P>
	Historically, provincial governments have used the sales tax to 
engage in social and economic engineering according to the 
demands of their electorates. This explains why some provinces 
exempt food, children's clothing, reading materials, some services 
and medical supplies from sales taxes while others tax such items, 
some at different rates from those charged in other provinces.
<P>
	On top of this there were differences in the rates of taxation 
depending on how much money provincial governments had to 
raise by this method. Some taxed people and companies at different 
rates; some spent more than others; all of which determined the 
average provincial sales tax rate in the individual province.
<P>
	The GST has a much broader base of taxation than the provincial 
sales taxes. Blending them therefore meant that provincial taxes 
had to be put on to many items of consumption that were 
previously untaxed. However this broadening of the tax base meant 
that provinces could raise the same amount of money at lower tax 
rates. This fact underlies the Liberal assertion that provincial tax 
rates are lower in favour of consumers. This of course is a shell 
game. By definition the average consumer pays the same with the 
blended sales tax as she did with the GST plus the provincial sales 
tax. Otherwise it would have been a tax grab and we would have 
heard the screams all across the country.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	Averages hide a lot of variations in gains and losses to 
individuals under different circumstances. People who buy a lot of 
reading material may or may not make up the extra taxes they pay 
through reductions in the rates paid on other consumer purchases. 
People who find their tax obligations have increased are justified in 
complaining to the Liberals since they voted for the elimination of 
the GST, not a change which costs them personally.
<P>
	A fifth reason Reform opposes the blended tax legislation is that 
the Liberals have claimed that the administration of the blended tax 
will result in substantial savings in administrative costs to 
governments and taxpayers. Returns have to be filed and audits 
only have to deal with one bureaucracy rather than two. Such 
savings are real. However the question arises as to how large these 
savings will be in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7025"> 7025 </A></B>
<P>
relation to the extra costs involved in switching to the new system 
and in the day to day operations.
<P>
	As it turns out, one provision in the legislation has resulted in a 
significant increase in costs. I will discuss this briefly by 
describing the problem that it attempted to address. It is the 
so-called tax-in provision of the legislation.
<P>
	This provision requires merchants to display all prices including 
the taxes paid and not show the taxes separately. This mandated tax 
inclusive pricing works very well in Europe. It removes many of 
the annoyances consumers experience when under the present 
system they are faced with a bill for their goods and services, often 
inflated unexpectedly much by the GST and provincial sales taxes 
whenever they reach the check-out counter. European shoppers 
became quickly used to tax-in pricing and merchants adjusted their 
operations quickly.
<P>
	Many in Europe and in Canada had opposed the inclusion of 
tax-in pricing requirements in the GST legislation because of the 
fear that it would permit governments to raise GST rates of taxation 
surreptitiously without explicit consultation and the kind of 
openness and resistance which is brought when people are required 
to file their personal income taxes. According to the experience in 
Europe, it turns out that this fear was not well placed.
<P>
	When the Government of Germany recently tried to raise the 
GST tax by one percentage point, it ran into a storm of opposition. 
In the end it was forced to drop the plan for this increased tax. I 
believe the same would occur in Canada.
<P>
	It is for all these reasons that show an advantage of tax-in pricing 
that the Reform Party in its minority report to the study on the GST 
endorsed the tax-in pricing provision for a national sales tax. 
However, the problem is that we do not have a national sales tax. 
We have what has been called a blended sales tax in order to 
distinguish it from the national sales tax. In fact it applies only to 
four of the Atlantic provinces.
<P>
	As it turns out, I have no doubt that there may be savings for 
individual retailers from having only one sales tax, the blended 
sales tax. I have not seen how big these savings are. Therefore I am 
not able to relate them to the kinds of costs the tax-in pricing 
provision has imposed on these retailers and which costs they are 
required to pass on to the consumers in the provinces which are 
subjected to this legislation.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	What are these costs? There is the once and for all cost required 
of individual firms to switch their system of calculating the price 
charged at the till. This requires not only reprogramming 
computers, but it is very important that it also requires the 
retraining of the individuals serving the consumers. These once and 
for all costs may  be justifiable in light of the savings on the other 
side by not having to deal with two authorities.
<P>
	It turns out that there are also very large costs associated with 
day to day operations which will go on for as long as there is a 
blended sales tax in that region and the GST and provincial sales 
taxes in the other provinces. What are these costs?
<P>
	According to an independent study by Ernst and Young, prices 
that have been attached to labels on goods manufactured, let us say 
in the United States or Ontario, to be marketed throughout Canada 
will have to be changed. Tags will have to be removed by hand and 
replaced on the goods that are being sold in that area. In some cases 
the price is printed on the good, such as on greeting cards the price 
is printed on the back at the bottom. Stores will have to relabel all 
of those cards.
<P>
	Major retailers base many of their marketing campaigns on the 
use of flyers and house to house distribution of material. Right now 
the copy is prepared only once with the prices and conditions 
applying to all of Canada. In that particular region, special copies 
will have to be written and separate copies will have to be printed. 
It is a very serious increase in costs.
<P>
	We should also note that warehousing and cost of distribution are 
expensive parts of retailing. Those of us who have never been in 
that business do not realize what it takes to keep the shelves filled 
with goods of the required size, quality, quantity and variety that 
consumers want. One problem is that the varieties, quantities and 
qualities are not predictable.
<P>
	Retailers now have as an option that if in one region their sales 
have exceeded those expected and they require more goods from 
another region, they can go to the warehouse in another region and 
ship the goods to the area with the shortage. There will now be an 
invisible barrier at the edge of the blended tax zone which means 
they cannot get something from the other warehouses. The studies 
said that truckers who deliver goods in regions on either side of the 
invisible barrier may now have to shift the goods around in their 
trucks to get at those goods which have the appropriate label for the 
area. This is not a fantasy. This is not something made up. Some 
estimates are that these costs may be as high as $100 million for 
this region.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	Let us say that half of it involves continuous costs every year. 
Who is going to pay those costs? The consumers in that region. 
Eaton's and other big national retailers cannot pass them on to the 
rest of the country because there is too much competition, forcing 
them to keep prices down, not allowing them to raise prices.
<P>
	We believe that the very least the government can do in order to 
help the consumers of the Atlantic provinces is to postpone the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7026"> 7026 </A></B>
<P>
required tax in pricing approach until a blended sales tax or a 
national sales tax exists throughout the country.
<P>
	In the meantime, however, there are so many flaws in this bill 
and in this approach to replace the GST that I believe Reform is 
acting in a socially responsible manner by opposing it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member opposite for his comments. Unfortunately, one gets used 
to a lot of the rhetoric coming from the other side, so the hon. 
member's candour and honesty is very refreshing.
<P>
	He endorses harmonization. I would not expect otherwise, in the 
light of the Reform Party's position after the GST review. He 
endorses tax included pricing. He is widely recognized as a 
prominent economist. I would be surprised if he said otherwise. He 
accepts, in all fairness, that there will be one time costs, but in the 
light of ongoing savings they may well be offset in the long run. All 
of that is refreshing and welcome. I would be surprised if the hon. 
member had said otherwise. He also has some doubts and some 
concerns. That is also fair.
<P>
	I want to make one observation and ask him one quick question. 
The observation is on tax included pricing. Is he aware of the 
accommodations that the government has made in consultation 
with businesses in responding to the very concerns he raised about 
implementing a harmonized system in one region and not others? 
For instance, accommodations are being made which will allow 
catalogue publishers and retailers that produce catalogues to 
overcome the concerns they have. They need not print the prices in 
the harmonized provinces, as long as they indicate in the catalogue 
that their prices do not include taxes.
<P>
	Is he aware that discussions are ongoing and regulations will 
reflect that the government and retailers have agreed to allow bin 
pricing for those items that are labelled, which would otherwise 
have to be relabelled individually? That would be a tremendous 
imposition on business so the government has accepted the 
principle of allowing small items that are prelabelled to be placed 
in bins, with the prices indicated on the bin. In modern retailing 
that is often the way things are done. We only have to think of our 
neighbourhood stores.
<P>
	Is he also aware that the opportunity still exists for retailers to 
indicate sale prices that are exclusive of taxes as long as the tax 
included price is also indicated?
<P>
	Is he aware that there are ongoing discussions toward improving 
the system more as regulations are drafted? He may not have been 
aware of those things. I am sure he will welcome all of those 
comments.
<P>
	The question is to him as an economist, because he stood and 
spoke as an economist and less so as a politician. We welcome that 
in debates on critical issues such as this.
<P>
	He did not speak, at least not at length, about the inefficiencies in 
provincial sales taxes, particularly where hidden taxes are 
concerned, which is a cascading of taxes, tax on tax. The ultimate 
consumer pays for all those hidden taxes.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	I wonder if he would comment on whether a harmonized system 
where input credits are available now, not just for those taxes paid 
under the GST system, but for the component of provincial taxes 
would also be available, is a much more efficient system. I ask him 
what a rational retailer business person would do in light of those 
savings.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the kind words of the 
member opposite.
<P>
	The steps now being taken in order to deal with the shortcomings 
of the tax in pricing provision are a typical Liberal approach: 
``There is no sense in admitting that we made a mistake and drop 
the whole thing but let us patch it up''.
<P>
	The member and I sat together in finance committee hearings 
about the GST. The length of the horror stories about the different 
provisions and difficulties that business has was caused by a 
previous government's unwillingness to do the right thing and say: 
``We made a mistake. Let's drop it. Let us go, say, for a broad based 
tax. Instead of 7 per cent, let us have it on everything but only 4 per 
cent''. That is what we heard all the time.
<P>
	I predict that if the member is going to sit in the finance 
committee two years from now he will hear horror stories about the 
administrative costs, the difficulties of going from bin pricing to all 
kinds of other provisions that he has mentioned. The government is 
going in the right direction but why does it not swallow its pride 
and say: ``We'll suspend the tax in pricing provision for this 
legislation in order to get the other advantages''.
<P>
	I agree with him. This is why with all intellectual honesty we 
came to Ottawa and said that when the government does something 
right, proposes something that is good for Canada, we will support 
it. We will not play pure politics. That is why we said in our 
minority report that we believe harmonization of provincial sales 
taxes and the GST is a good idea. We still think so.
<P>
	However, we did not endorse and we cannot honestly endorse the 
imposition of such a tax in a particular region only and having the 
rest of the country pay substantial sums for this to be acceptable to 
those regions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7027"> 7027 </A></B>
<P>
	I feel that the thrust of what I said remains unchallenged by the 
points made by the member opposite. This is not a good piece of 
legislation. At the very least Canadians should expect that the tax 
in pricing provision be removed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his responses. He did not comment on the second part of the 
question and I want to give him an opportunity to do so. I asked 
him about the credits on inputs and how that will work in a 
harmonized system. Does it make good economic sense and what 
will happen to those savings?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Madam Speaker, I thought that I indirectly 
admitted the correctness of this position. This is exactly why 
Reform supported the idea that we should have a national sales tax. 
Though I must say to the hon. member that after the very lengthy 
study of the GST as it is in operation I have really changed my 
mind about the merit of such a value added tax unless we could 
start from scratch and do what the New Zealand government did: 
put it broadly on everything.
<P>
	The administrative nightmare, the distortions that I have 
mentioned in my speech that are caused by exemptions, zero rating 
and various other twists that are too complicated to explain here 
have made the tax into a nightmare. I do not believe it can be fixed. 
To come forward and say that we need a valued added tax on 
everything, including food, simply will not go in this political 
system, however good it would be.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	For this reason I believe the country needs fundamental tax 
reform which would lead to flatter rates: flatter personal income 
tax rates, the elimination of double taxation on income from 
property and lower rates or maybe even the elimination of capital 
gains taxes. Economists agree that all those measures would do 
wonders for the efficiency and the growth of an economy.
<P>
	In the process of having such tax reform I believe that it would 
be appropriate to eliminate the GST and impose the revenue loss on 
the other forms of taxation. We have done some very preliminary 
calculations which involve a flat tax. This is not Reform Party 
policy but we are doing our homework which is expected of us as 
elected members of Parliament. We are expected to do our 
homework, to investigate the costs and benefits of different types 
of taxation.
<P>
	When we ran simulations of different tax rates on the computer, 
we discovered that the average flat tax rate would have to increase 
by only about three percentage points to afford to get rid of the GST 
with all the nightmares associated with it, including the need to 
send monthly cheques to individuals in Canada with lower 
incomes. Members know how much it costs to write, print and keep 
track of cheques, yet the GST and the blended sales tax require the 
government to send out those kinds of cheques to people with low 
incomes. They can be helped some other way.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with considerable pleasure that I rise to take my turn in the debate 
on Bill C-70, which concerns various amendments to legislation 
pertaining to the goods and services tax in Canada, commonly 
known as the GST.
<P>
	This bill is the recognition in fact of action taken by the current 
federal government to harmonize the GST with the provincial sales 
tax in three maritime provinces, with the combined tax becoming 
the HST or harmonized sales tax. The HST does not apply to the 
purchase of books anywhere in Canada by public corporations, 
such as public libraries, schools, colleges and universities. All 
organizations involved in literacy programs are also now exempt 
under this bill from paying the GST on books.
<P>
	We have many reservations about this bill. About its form, to 
start with. This is, by the way, a very technical bill of some 300 
pages in length. It was delivered to the official opposition late 
yesterday afternoon. Opposition members therefore had little time 
to properly prepare criticism, which we had hoped would be more 
articulate and thorough, because of the lack of time and the size of 
the document.
<P>
	It is at once intriguing and distressing, because it must be 
remembered that the government's position on this is not clear. The 
history of the debate on the GST is not a high point in the history of 
the Liberal Party of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	While very important promises to kill the GST were made by the 
Liberal Party in its red book, this does not even come close. This is 
about harmonization, with the maritimes in this case.
<P>
	In an area where the government party does not keep its 
promises, we would have expected them to at least have an open 
and truly honourable debate on this issue, after giving the 
opposition parties more time so we could have been better prepared 
than we are now.
<P>
	The government had made a clear, simple and specific 
commitment, but so far it has not kept its promises, quite the 
contrary. On an individual level, this has been illustrated by the 
behaviour of the Deputy Prime Minister and member for Hamilton 
East, and the promises she made, hopefully in good faith. Unless 
they were made in good faith and with intellectual honesty, this 
will confirm every preconceived idea the people of this country 
have about politicians not weighing their words.
<P>
	That is what the Liberal candidate for Hamilton East did at the 
time, when stating that she would resign if the GST was not 
abolished. When the GST was not abolished, she had to resign, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7028"> 7028 </A></B>
<P>
which she did, not out of intellectual honesty, but under pressure 
she could not resist. She resigned for form's sake. The very next 
day,  the Prime Minister called a by-election in her riding and she 
was re-elected with, fortunately, a clear warning from the people 
that she must not play that little game again.
<P>
	During a difficult time of fiscal restraint, this little game has cost 
Canadian taxpayers $500,000, just because one person did not keep 
her word, but pretended to, in order to save face at public expense.
<P>
	Let me quote the hon. member. Not too long ago, on March 11, 
1996, the <I>Globe and Mail</I> reported something she had said as a 
candidate:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``I have already said personally and very directly that if the GST 
is not abolished, I will resign''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	She did resign, but it was for appearances' sake, a symbolic 
resignation. She did not resign as a matter of principle, saying: 
``Since the government to which I belong did not do this, I would 
be ashamed to be a part of it''. No, she resigned for appearaances' 
sake, because she could not withstand the pressure brought to bear 
on her. Then, taxpayers had to pay for the intellectual 
irresponsibility displayed regarding this issue.
<P>
	You will agree that the Prime Minister does not fare much better. 
The Prime Minister said, with typical clarity and transparency, 
using carefully chosen words: ``We will scrap the GST''. As you 
know, to scrap means to get rid of something. The yard is now full 
of scrap. The Prime Minister, in his great wisdom, and also with 
indignation and all the sincerity that he could display, said time and 
again, in reference to the Liberals' red book: ``We will scrap the 
GST''.
<P>
	What is the situation now? The Prime Minister cannot claim he 
is unable to take action. After all, he is in office, he is the Prime 
Minister. We are not quoting some backbencher, we are quoting the 
Prime Minister, the leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, who 
came into office on October 25, 1993, following an election 
campaign that included written and oral commitments, including 
this one, which could not be any clearer: ``We will scrap the GST''. 
This promise is not worth much more than this other slogan of the 
time: ``jobs, jobs, jobs''. What happened to that other 
commitment? ``We will scrap the GST'' and ``jobs, jobs, jobs'' are 
pretty well on a par. People say just about anything they want, 
including the Liberal candidates who ran in the ridings of Hamilton 
East and Saint-Maurice.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	They say anything that comes to mind, that they will resign or 
that they will scrap the GST. The Prime Minister said as clearly as 
could be that he disagreed with this tax, when he said: ``We hate the 
GST and we will kill it''. This is an unequivocal statement. It does 
not leave much room for interpretation. The Prime Minister did not 
make many clear and specific commitments  during his career, but 
he did promise to get rid of the GST.
<P>
	Today, we can see what is happening on this issue. The 
government no longer mentions it, except to try to harmonize that 
tax. We saw what the Liberals accomplished in three maritime 
provinces. A harmonization process did take place. It was 
explained that, before this harmonization, provincial and federal 
taxes amounted to 19 per cent of the consumer price. An agreement 
was reached to lower this 19 per cent to 15 per cent.
<P>
	The shortfall was made up in two ways. First, there was the 
immediate payment of approximately one billion dollars to these 
three maritime provinces, using money from the taxes paid by the 
other seven provinces. This money did not just drop out of the sky. 
It came from the other provinces. And the way the accounts are 
figured out in Canada, almost $250 million of this came from 
Quebec taxpayers.
<P>
	That is harmonization for you. That is Canada's idea of 
distributing the wealth fairly. We are used to this game, but we will 
not put up with it, and it is one of many reasons why Quebecers are 
giving more and more thought to whether they want to remain in 
this country and why they came within a hair of deciding to leave 
on October 30, 1995. It must be remembered, and there is no reason 
not to say it, that on that day 60 per cent of francophones made a 
decision to leave Canada, and we will keep pointing this out.
<P>
	Here we have a wonderful example of what it means to belong to 
Canada and what it costs. As we see it, staying with federalism is 
costing the Quebec economy. Every year, we come up short, unless 
you factor in, as the federal government does, what we receive in 
unemployment insurance and social assistance. Unless we boast 
that Quebec is poorer than the other provinces. And this is the 
diabolical logic the federalists are stuck with when they try to sell 
federalism in Quebec.
<P>
	It therefore looks like the people, the governments of the three 
maritime provinces in question were, to put it bluntly, bought, 
given one billion dollars in exchange for agreeing to harmonize the 
tax, as it were.
<P>
	The second way of making up the shortfall of 4 per cent 
mentioned earlier, the 19 per cent that turned into 15 per cent in 
return for one billion up front, is that they said that from now on, 
transfer payments would be the way to ensure that these three 
maritime provinces were not penalized. In other words, year after 
year, almost automatically, the maritime provinces, through 
equalization payments, will be compensated for this loss of 4 per 
cent, a practice we condemn.
<P>
	This is one of the aspects that we feel shows a great lack of 
regard for other Canadians and other provinces. Another aspect, 
which is more likely to affect consumers, is the decision that was 
made as part of this  harmonization with the maritime provinces to 
put taxes which are now visible under wraps once more, taxes that 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7029"> 7029 </A></B>
<P>
consumers could see so they could figure, when they paid for a 
meal or for an item of clothing, how much they were paying in 
federal taxes. At the time that was something new, but now it seems 
that harmonization will again put this tax under wraps.
<P>
	This is probably typical of the way the government runs the 
country, because when it is not actually hiding something, it is at 
least trying to.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	This is a partial harmonization because it also harmonizes a lack 
of transparency. The public will be even less aware of how much it 
pays for services it receives from the federal government. This 
does not augur well.
<P>
	At a time when there is so much talk about proper management 
of public moneys, when all consumers are being asked to do more 
and more in this respect, I think it is rather insulting that the 
government should go ahead and hide the GST, although the 
Liberals, and this was part of the abolition scenario, had made a 
clear commitment to keep a visible GST.
<P>
	A typical example is what happened to the report of the finance 
committee where, in 1994, the Liberal majority said it would be 
improper to hide from Canadians the taxes they were paying to 
their governments and that creating a hidden tax would make it 
difficult for them to make the government accountable for the way 
these taxes were collected and, to a lesser extent, how public 
moneys were spent.
<P>
	In fact, in a dissenting report by the Liberal minority in 1989, 
under the Conservatives, the Liberals said that if the GST was 
hidden in the sales price, it would be much easier for the 
government to increase it later on.
<P>
	When the Liberal government decides to hide the GST, it knows 
very well what it is doing. It cannot plead ignorance, and it is 
reversing the positions it formerly held on the issue and doing so 
publicly.
<P>
	In concluding, I still think we have reason to be pleased that 
some representations made by the Bloc Quebecois were partially 
included, as regards the GST on books. As was pointed out earlier, 
from now on all public institutions involved in education and 
literacy training-in culture as well, when we include public 
libraries, schools, universities, and community colleges-will all 
be able to buy books without paying the GST. We are pleased 
because otherwise, it would mean putting a tax on knowledge, 
research and intellectual curiosity.
<P>
	We are pleased but we deplore the fact that this exemption on 
books is not extended to all taxpayers who buy books in this 
country but reserved only for public institutions.

thanks to the leadership of Toronto City Councillor Kay Gardner 
and the Toronto Board of Health, the Drink Smart Canada 
campaign promoting the responsible use of alcohol has been 
endorsed by over 120 Canadian cities. Their concern about alcohol 
abuse, particularly during pregnancy, was one of the main reasons 
for their supporting health warning labels on the containers of 
alcoholic beverages.

	On October 16, the Minister of Health and the president of the

alcohol syndrome. They made it clear that the wisest course for 
women to take was to refrain from alcohol consumption during 
pregnancy.

have noticed that many of my colleagues are wearing red ribbons 
on their lapels this week. I would like to take this opportunity to tell 
Canadians about the significance of these ribbons.
<P>
	This past Saturday MADD Canada launched its annual red 
ribbon campaign. MADD is asking people to place these ribbons on 
the antennae of their vehicles as a reminder to practise safe and 
sober driving at all times, but especially during the holiday season.
<P>
	The holiday season is supposed to be a time of joy and 
happiness, of friends and of family, but too often party functions 
and social gatherings associated with the holiday season end in 
tragedy. The women and men of MADD Canada, many of whom 
have suffered their own personal tragedies, want to make sure that 
for others the holiday season will continue to be a time of joy and 
happiness rather than of mourning and regret.
<P>

gratitude and support for MADD Canada and wish them the best of

CIDA. After three years of restructuring, CIDA has yet to prove its 
capacity for renewal, as a number of grey areas still exist, 
according to the auditor general.
<P>
	We are concerned to note that it continues to have difficulty 
explaining the contributions its projects make to the government's 
prime objectives as defined in <I>Canada in the World</I>. We deplore the 
agency's lack of transparency with its partners and the Canadian 
public and its delay in setting up a more effective accounting and 
management system.
<P>
	In the opinion of the Bloc Quebecois, the progress is too slow. 
We think CIDA should have its own enabling legislation, which 
would provide it with a clear mandate and require it to be more 
transparent.

	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
serious concern is being expressed for the welfare of children. In 
Vancouver East and in many areas of Canada there are a large 
number of families that live under the poverty line. These are 
families with children who, like their parents, live in poverty.
<P>
	The current discussion between federal and provincial 
governments is very encouraging. However, even though money is 
a concern, early prevention is just as much of a concern. We keep 
looking for the perfect program to assist this category of people. 
This program exists and is successful. It is the Community Action 
Plan for Children, CAPC.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The program started up in 1992. In 1994, the grant was cut in 
half, and next year other significant cuts will be made, preventing 
the program from continuing.
<P>
	The organizations responsible for the program work with 
families and children. I would ask the Minister of Health to 
continue and expand the program because, as one native participant 
put it: ``Children have better parents thanks to the Community 
Action Plan for Children''.

	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canada's children are our future. Every Canadian child regardless 
of their parents' income or their province's wealth deserves the 
basic necessities of life.
<P>
	In a prosperous country like ours there is no reason we cannot 
nurture all our children; nurture their little bodies, their bright 
minds, their strong spirit and their diverse personalities.
<P>
	In Alberta 20 per cent of our children live below the poverty line. 
This means that one in five is at risk. One in five faces a life 
without hope for a healthy, happy childhood and without hope of 
contributing to and sharing in Canada's bright future.
<P>
	There is an urgent need and an inescapable responsibility to 
harmonize federal-provincial programs for children at risk. The 
Liberal members of Parliament from across northern and western 
Canada are encouraged by the progress made by our Minister of 
Human Resources Development and the provincial ministers this 
week. We are heartened by their promise to have concrete 
recommendations for the Prime Minister and provincial premiers 
by January.

	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the people of Saskatchewan have a proud tradition of 
working together to help those in need. Children living in poverty 
are a high priority for us. A national child benefit targets resources 
to those in need. It helps families in need. It is good family policy.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	This is the kind of action poor children need, not the false hope 
offered by the third party. Its talk about helping families is little 
more than a smokescreen for a program of tax cuts that will benefit 
wealthy taxpayers more than poor families. It brags about taking a 
million people off the tax rolls, many of whom now get a refund 
from the government because of the child benefit or GST rebate.
<P>
	What it does not tell Canadians is that its fresh start will mean 
over $3,000 in tax savings for a high income family of over 
$100,000 and less than $500 for families living on $15,000. 
Whatever happened to the lofty statements from the third party 
about targeting resources to those in need?

poverty.

Speaker, Canadian Airlines is desperately trying to restructure. The 
ripple effect for the economy is great, especially in western 
Canada. I must speak up for the workers in my area of B.C. who 
have given so much to keep Canadian airborne.
<P>
	The company has considered all options to reorganize and part of 
the rearrangement is employee cost. Five of six unions have agreed 
to save jobs and, like always, Buzz Hargrove is the loner 
preventing any deal.
<P>
	Yesterday the hon. member for Burnaby-Kingsway asked the 
government to reintroduce trade barriers and to give money. The 
NDP member has no clue about economics. He, like union leader 
Buzz Hargrove, does not believe in markets or the democratic 
process.
<P>
	The NDP says it is standing up for jobs when in actual fact it is 
standing up for union control while keeping their members 
dependent.
<P>
	Canadian Airlines workers are in jeopardy of losing their jobs 
because the socialists are unwilling to demonstrate accountability

<P>
	Incomes are lower in aboriginal communities and housing is 
crowded, but birth rates in these communities are higher than 
average.
<P>
	Through programs like ``Head Start'' and ``Brighter Futures'' 
much has been accomplished by the government and by caring 
people in our communities, but there is still much more to do.

Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the many Canadians suffering

body's healthy cells. All parts of the body, including major organs, 
can be involved. While lupus knows no age or gender barriers, it is 
more prevalent among women in their child bearing years.
<P>
	An insidious chronic ailment, lupus is characterized by 
unpredictable flare-ups of acute disease activity causing pain, 
inflammation of body tissues and organs.
<P>
	Its erratic nature brings with it emotional turmoil and economic 
loss.
<P>
	To date there is no cure for lupus. Though medication provides 
some measure of control, its efficacy varies in each case and is not 
without long range debilitating side effects.
<P>
	Given the physical and economic consequences of lupus, 
persons severely afflicted by this disease who have a prolonged 
functional impairment and who have been assessed as disabled by 
qualified physicians call on this government to allow eligibility for 
disability tax credits without further investigation by Revenue 
Canada.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, pardon me, but the minister is not doing a good job of 
defending herself. What we are talking about here is a 200-page 
opinion on this matter, an unfavourable opinion from Revenue 
staff, a document that was not given to the public accounts

thoroughly investigate the family trust scandal.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	How can the government justify, other than by referring to the 
other government, that the committee in question, which was to 
investigate this scandal, was not aware of this 200-page opinion 
prepared by the departmental staff of the minister of revenue?

	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as usual when it comes to questions under the Access to 
Information Act, the department responds directly and 
considerably. We reviewed all the documentation. We wanted to 
provide to the requester the amount of information that we could. 
We felt that the appropriate thing was to provide the 200 pages. The 
review has been made. I would point out as well that we provided 
all the information to the public accounts committee that it 
requested.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, an article that appeared in a Canadian tax publication 
three weeks after the tabling of the Minister of Finance's motion, 
supposedly intended to close the tax loopholes, proposed no fewer 
than eight ways of getting around these new restrictions on 
transferring assets out of the country.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance admit that his ways and means 
motion still allows the rich to avoid paying their fair share of taxes 
and therefore leaves us back at square one?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
we closed the loophole with the ways and means motion. That is 
very clear.
<P>
	Now, if the hon. Leader of the Opposition thinks the tax experts 
in the private sector are going to give up trying, he has another 
think coming. We know very well that they will keep trying it on 
for size, that is how our system operates. But, I tell you, the 
loophole has been plugged. They will keep on trying, and we will 
keep on plugging the holes. That is how our system operates.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, of course the experts will keep trying, but with the 
government as an accessory? That is what is happening.
<P>
	On October 2, the Minister of Finance tabled a motion that was 
supposed to plug a tax loophole that allowed the transfer of a trust 
fund outside the country, like the $2 billion that was transferred to 
the United States tax free. In this motion, the Minister of Finance 
asks holders of Canadian trust funds to provide a guarantee equal to 
the amount of income tax they would normally have to pay 
Revenue Canada at the time of transferring the trust fund outside 
the country.
<P>
	Unlike the rules applying to ordinary citizens or other rules 
applying to guarantees for tax deferral by a trust fund, would the 
minister agree that no interest is collected on the amount deferred 
and there is no limit on the deferral period? No interest is charged.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>On deferred 
taxes? Is that it?
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows perfectly well, and if he 
does not, he can ask any accountant in his party, that deferred taxes 
are not taxes due. Taxes are due in cases where companies make a 
profit. If they make a profit, they will pay taxes immediately. 
Unfortunately, the hon. member is wrong once again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Finance is misleading us. That is the 
difference.
<P>
	What he is saying with his ways and means motion is that a rich 
taxpayer with a family trust that owes $1 million to Revenue 
Canada can defer this amount indefinitely without paying a cent in 
income tax. Try and do that as an average citizen, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the Bloc Quebecois critic is wrong.
<P>
	As soon as taxes are due they have to be paid. If they are not 
paid, interest will be charged. In the situation described by the hon. 
member, if a tax is not due, no payment is required. Payment is 
only required when taxes are due.

	Legislation was drafted in 1984, draft amendments to the Food

somebody or some group of people decided that the legislation and

claim the member is making his comments. I will repeat what I 
said yesterday.
<P>
	In the interests of everyone in getting to the bottom of all the 
circumstances surrounding this very tragic situation, it would 
possibly be advisable for Mr. Justice Krever to call the people who 
were there at the time to testify before the commission. Certainly in 
the case of Monique Bégin, I know she has already indicated in 
writing that she is prepared to appear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, none of these excuses hold water. The Deputy Prime 
Minister said yesterday that the former minister of health offered to 
testify to the Krever commission and the commission declined to 
call her. However, in a letter from Mr. Rennie, counsel to the 
former minister Monique Bégin, to the Krever commission on 
August 16, the minister indicated she did not wish to testify or offer 
any evidence but rather would respond only by way of written 
submission.
<P>
	Mr. Justice Krever has had trouble right from the start trying to 
ascertain why in 1984 the Liberal government of the day did not 
proceed with legislation and regulations that might have prevented 
the tainted blood scandal.
<P>
	Why does the government not simply provide Justice Krever 
with all the information that he is requesting to get to the bottom of 
this tragedy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the statement that I made 
yesterday holds again today. In fact it was the legal representative 
for Mr. Justice Krever who made the statement last year that she 
did not intend to call any of the previous ministers as witnesses.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if we cannot persuade the government that it has a legal 
obligation to act in this matter, can we persuade the government 
that it has a moral obligation to act in this matter?
<P>
	Justice Krever thinks these documents hold the key to why the 
blood supply failed 3,000 AIDS victims and 12,000 victims of 
hepatitis C. It is the Liberals who constantly portray themselves in 
this House as the guardians of Canadian health care. Let them 
demonstrate it in a practical way.
<P>
	I appeal again to the Deputy Prime Minister to give Krever what 
he wants, give him the truth. Will the government release all the 
documents pertaining to the draft legislation and regulations of 
1984 to Justice Krever?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to underscore for 
the people of Canada that this government has no intention of 
protecting previous governments, particularly in light of the fact 
that the previous government about which the member has heard 
was the government of Mr. Brian Mulroney.
<P>
	That being said, I do want to underscore that if Mr. Justice 
Krever really wants to get to the bottom of the issues surrounding 
the Conservatives' decision allegedly not to proceed with 
regulations that had been proposed by the Liberals, he should call 
the Conservative and Liberal ministers to the commission.

that is not what I said yesterday. I said that the offer to be made by

Act had tied their little hands and they could not act; and now 
excuse number three, Judge Krever just has to subpoena some more

	Why do we care about these documents? A patient of mine, Judy

It is because of Judy B. that we need these documents.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	The least we can say is that the minister is not very sensitive to 
the very costly impact of the Employment Insurance Act on many 
unemployed people. Last Thursday, the minister said in this House, 
and I quote: ``We will shortly be making some very minor 
administrative changes to the regulations''. However, the measures 
that will most significantly affect the unemployed will take effect 
on January 5.
<P>
	So I am making another attempt. Can the minister tell us when 
the regulations will be ready, and can he assure us that they will 
include transitional measures to soften the brutal consequences of 
the bill that will come into effect on January 5?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the transitional period started 
last January. It is time the hon. member for Mercier realized that 
the reason why some provisions of the act were implemented on 
July 1 while others will take effect January 1 is precisely to give 
people time to adjust to the reform.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	Last week, I provided the hon. member with an answer 
concerning regulations. She asked whether there would be 
additional regulations. I am telling her again that the additional 
regulations will be minor and have a minor impact, particularly on 
relations with clients. These regulations will be made public in the 
coming weeks, but they are not very significant.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have to 
stand by my initial comment. The minister is definitely not 
sensitive. I will phrase the question differently, since he may not 
have understood it.
<P>
	So that women and young people without 26 35-hour weeks of 
work are not excluded from EI benefits, is the minister prepared to 
say that, for 1997 and 1998, those who will work between 15 and 
35 hours will be considered as having worked 35 hours, so they can 
collect benefits?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we are moving toward a new 
employment insurance program precisely to break some old 
patterns that kept people in a state of dependency.
<P>
	We chose to base the system on the number of hours worked, so 
that people can be protected, starting with their very first hour of 
work. People will no longer have to put up with employers who, in 
the past, would not provide more than 13 or 14 hours of work per 
week, because they did not want to pay premiums. I say to these 
workers that, as of January 1, this system will no longer exist and 
they will be covered from their first hour of work.

	My question is for the Minister of Transport. How much longer 
is the government going to allow one man to block the democratic 
rights of union employees?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member is quite correct to point out the 
importance of having the CAW onside not just with company 
management but with five other unions, with American Airlines 
and with the governments: the federal government, the government 
of the province of British Columbia and the government of the 
province of Alberta. It is important for them to be onside.
<P>
	The purpose of that is so we can present a common front when 
the company is dealing with its creditors. When it is dealing with 
its creditors, it is important to have the clear expression of will. 
That is why we urge the CAW leadership to come on board with the 
restructuring program.
<P>
	To engage in a long debate with respect to the change of 
legislation or something in the future is not productive at this 
particular time. What we want at this time is to have a common 
front of all the unions, the three governments concerned and the 
two companies so that we can negotiate successfully with the 
creditors.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if air travellers lose confidence in Canadian Airlines and 
book with another company perhaps from the U.S., that means lost 
revenue for Canadian Airlines.
<P>
	This is not about big corporations. It is about the men and 
women whose financial security is at stake, people like the single 
mother of two who wrote: ``Mr. Gouk, you must keep trying to help 
us. I love my job and I need it. Every day that this issue remains 
unsettled does irreparable damage to my company''. To ``my 
company''; that is how Canadian employees feel.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Transport: When is the Liberal 
Party going to join with Reform in a non-partisan manner and tell 
that single mother that we are listening, that we care, and that we 
will act? How much longer can one person be allowed to cause this 
anguish and threaten the financial security of her airline?
<P>
<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I share with all members of the House the concern over 
the situation that the individual quoted earlier is in. It is a serious 
problem for the employees of Canadian, of whom there are 16,400 
who have their employment threatened if the company is put in 
further jeopardy.
<P>
	I am pleased, however, to announce that American Airlines has 
now agreed to take part in restructuring and to accept Canadian 
Airlines' proposal for a reduction of its fees as requested by 
Canadian. This will be the fees on such services as yield 
management, accounting functions, operations planning and 
support. This is a very positive step because it is the first time a 
creditor has indicated its firm support for the restructuring 
proposals put forward by the president of Canadian Airlines.

forced to reopen 2,000 other cases affecting an additional 70,000

<P>
	Are we to understand from the minister's remarks that the

its actions?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

deal of compassion for Singer's retired employees. This is an 
extremely complex situation, and the case has been brought to my 
attention in recent weeks. It has been examined from every angle.
<P>
	What I obviously said was that, had we reached an out of court 
settlement, as Singer's lawyers were requesting, any such 
settlement could have had an impact on other cases before the 
government, because it would not necessarily have reflected the 
very complex reality with respect to the rights, which are justified 
in this case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, the 
minister is droning on again about compassion. We know how he 
defines it. When there is no cost involved, he is compassionate. But 
when he has to pay, his compassion is all gone.
<P>
	The battle by Singer's retired employees against the federal 
government can be compared to the fight between David and 
Goliath. Everyone knows that all these retired workers abandoned 
by the federal government do not have the means to defend 
themselves before the courts, while the federal government can 
afford to.

reduce taxes for the working poor, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development said: ``Very often low income families do 
not pay taxes which is the reason we are looking for a more 
sophisticated system''.
<P>
	A single income family of four earning less than $23,000 now 
pays over $1,700 in federal taxes. Why will the minister not do 
something to help these families and lower their taxes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
the hon. member will look at the vast range of measures which the 
government has brought in-the  working income supplement, help 
for poor families, help for caregivers-she will see that we have 
done exactly that.
<P>
	If she will also look at her own numbers, she will find that those 
low income families for whom she is now saying she would 
provide relief will receive a minuscule amount of relief compared 
to the amount of relief the Reform Party is prepared to offer upper 
income Canadians.
<P>
	By cutting health care and by cutting equalization she is 
probably taking money away from low income Canadians to give it 
to their rich friends. That is simply not on.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr.

Under Reform's plan these families would pay no federal taxes and 
would instead receive a refund of $690.
<P>
	Contrary to the minister's statement yesterday, 6.1 million low 
income Canadians now pay taxes. We do not need a new, 
sophisticated system or a new government program, as the minister 
suggests. Anyone can see that these Canadians are being crushed 
under the burden of taxation. Will the minister just lower their 
taxes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Reform Party owes it to Canadians to put the true facts forward 
on what its plan is.
<P>
	If those low income Canadians lived in one of the seven 
provinces receiving equalization, they would not get the same level 
of public services to which they are entitled now as a result of what 
Reform has said. If somebody in a family happened to get sick and 
the province in which they lived had to absorb a $4 billion cut to 
the Canadian health and social transfer that the Reform Party has 
advocated, they would be in deep difficulty.
<P>
	If that family required the Canadian pension plan or help in old 
age it would not get it because what the Reform Party has put in 
front of the Canadian people is a pension plan for upper income 
Canadians and would deprive lower income Canadians.

over a difference of 10 to 12 per cent.
<P>
	Given that each 1 per cent reduction in the interest rate on credit 
cards enables Canadian and Quebec consumers to save at least $10 
million a month, why is the minister not acting to put a stop to 
these indecent rates?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canadians are faced 
with several hundred credit card choices. Many of those credit 
cards have very low interest rates below 10 per cent, some as low as 
9.25 per cent. Canadians have that choice.
<P>
	There is also a wide variety of items on credit cards: discounts 
on goods, airline points and all of these various things. It is not that 
Canadians do not want those choices. Canadians do want those 
choices. The cost of credit cards is a very small proportion of 
consumer debt. I believe that something like 3 per cent of the total 
consumer debt is on interest bearing credit cards so it is really a 
very small proportion of that.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since 1994, 
three members have tabled bills in this House to cap credit card 
interest rates: myself, the member for Simcoe North and the 
member for Davenport, a few weeks ago. Furthermore, there are 
more than 140 members of this House from all parties demanding 
that the banks and major stores lower their interest rates on credit 
cards.
<P>
	If this effort does not pan out within a few weeks, is the minister 
prepared to support Bill C-351 tabled in this House by the member 
for Davenport on November 21?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the problem with 
capping credit rates is that it reduces their availability to 
consumers. Hundreds of thousands of consumers would not have 
credit cards available to them.
<P>
	Canadian consumers are smart enough to chose the right cards. 
When they go out to do their Christmas shopping they are going to 
get the best deal for their families. When they go out looking for 
credit cards they will also make the best deal for their families.

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, just a 
little correction for the minister. I am sure he somehow missed this 
but the Reform plan would take one million low income people off 
the tax rolls. That $4  billion would be put back into health care. If 
this plan did help wealthy Canadians then the millionaire finance 
minister would be in favour of it.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I ask the hon. member to be very judicious in his 
choice of words. He is repeating the words he used yesterday. 
Please be judicious.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, if people want to know how much 
importance the Liberals place on parenting, they should check out 
the government's family tax policy. It is a tax policy that forces the 
single income earner with a $60,000 income to pay $7,000 more in 
tax than the same family where both parents are working outside 
the home. In other words, the government policy on parenting is to 
tax parents $7,000 more, a parenting tax.
<P>
	When will the minister recognize the gross injustice of this 
inequity in the tax system and quit punishing families who choose 
to raise their children at home?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the one million families referred to by the hon. member would end 
up paying for that tax reduction in lowered services if they lived in 
one of the equalization receiving provinces. When a party cuts 
equalization, it is saying that Canadians who live in those 
provinces are not entitled to the same level of public services.
<P>
	The hon. member says that his party will put $4 billion into 
health care which is simply not the truth. The fact is it would take 
$4 billion out of health care at the very beginning. Then it would 
ask Canadians to trust that it would put it back, but Canadians will 
not do that.
<P>
	On the issue of millionaires, I would like to thank you, Mr. 
Speaker, for defending the member for Calgary Centre against the 
attacks from one of his own.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It goes both ways so please be very judicious in 
your choice of words.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 70 per 
cent of women are in the workforce today. Only 30 per cent want to 
be there.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> The reason they cannot is because of this 
government's tax policy, and I remind hon. members across the 
way to check out the latest Angus Reid and Decima polls.
<P>
<B>(1455 )</B>
<P>
	The average Canadian family pays 36 per cent of its income to 
provide food, shelter and clothing. The tax burden takes up another
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7040"> 7040 </A></B>
<P>
whopping 46 per cent. That leaves Canadians with 18 per cent of 
their income to purchase all those luxuries out there, things like a 
car to go to work, a telephone and a bed to sleep in.
<P>
	When will the government realize that this tax burden is 
crushing Canadians and eliminating their options to live a decent 
life? When will the government cut taxes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Canada pension plan, which the Reform Party would seek to 
destroy, is depended on by more women than men. It is an essential 
part of their retirement. The Reform Party would take it away.
<P>
	Health care, which the Reform Party will cut, is important to 
Canadian women. Why is the Reform Party threatening to take it 
away? Equalization payments in Atlantic Canada, Manitoba and 
Saskatchewan are important for the public services that they supply 
to women.
<P>
	The Reform Party has the nerve to stand up here and say that 
they would defend the basic public services on which women 
depend. The facts speak for themselves. This party is a 14th 
century party raising headlines in the 8th century. That is what we 
are dealing with.

<P>
	Earlier this year, for the first time, a minister allowed the 
lowering to half mast of the flag on the Peace Tower to honour 
police officers killed in the line of duty.
<P>
	Is the minister prepared to allow the lowering of the Peace Tower 
flag for other events of mourning such as the national day of 
mourning for workers killed and injured on the job or, more 
imminently, this Friday for the national day of remembrance and 
action on violence against women?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member who has 
involved herself very much in this issue will know that in 1966

<P>
	However, as a result of the intervention of the member and 
others when the day of mourning for police across the country was 
brought to our attention we were able to revisit the protocol. 
Indeed, we are developing a new system where the flag can be 
flown at half mast to share the nation's sense of collective grief 
around issues like the deaths of workers. On the national day of 
remembrance and action on violence against women the flag will 
be flying at half mast this Friday.

<P>

<P>
	My question if for the Deputy Prime Minister. Since this was the 
only recommendation that the government decided to move on of 
the many recommendations coming out of changes to Canada Post, 
and considering that 10,000 families will suffer because people 
will lose their jobs as a result of this decision, will the Deputy 
Prime Minister explain to the House why the government is 
moving on such a cruel and tasteless act that will wreak havoc with 
10,000 families across this country six days after Christmas. Will 
she reconsider this decision?

question is for the Minister of Finance and it is a very simple 
question. It is a question that I asked him last week, a question the 
minister did not answer. Instead, I got some warmed over rhetoric.
<P>
	I would like to ask the Minister of Finance whether he and his 
Liberal government believe that the employment insurance account 
should be used, yes or no, for the purpose of reducing the deficit.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the unemployment insurance account is being treated by this 
government exactly as it was under the previous government. In 
fact, the innovations brought in by the previous government were 
the recommendations of the auditor general.
<P>
	As the hon. member knows, since we have taken office we have 
in each and every year brought unemployment insurance premiums 
down. In fact, in the last two years we have brought them down by 
$1.8 billion. Also, as the hon. member knows, the fact is that when 
the  Conservative government was in power each and every year 
that it took office it increased those premiums.
<P>
	The real question that the whole country wants to know is how is 
the Progressive Conservative Party going to pay for the massive tax 
cut it has recommended. Is the Conservative Party going to do as 
Reform and cut health care? Is it going to do as Reform and cut 
equalization payments?

	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last week I did 
rise on a question of privilege protesting a directive of the Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans to department staff members ordering 
them to track all calls from MPs.
<P>
	It is my contention that the directive to track calls from MPs will 
have a chilling effect on communication between MPs and public 
servants. This will cause particular hardship for members' staff 
members who contact public servants on a regular basis to seek 
help as they respond to calls from constituents.
<P>
	As an example, last Friday DFO staff members in Vancouver 
were reminding my staff that they would have to record the fact 
that they had spoken to my staff member.
<P>
	To resolve the matter, I would propose that the minister 
voluntarily withdraw the directive.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, that was where the matter stood, if I 
might use that term, when we broke the last time. At that time I said 
to the House that I would return to the question of privilege, which 
I am now, and that I wanted perhaps to clarify the record or at least 
to put on the record his side of the story, the hon. Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, who is with us now.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, quite frankly I am surprise by the question of 
privilege that has been raised by the hon.  member for Delta. Very 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7042"> 7042 </A></B>
<P>
little surprises me after a few years in this House but I am really at 
a loss to understand why this is considered to be a loss of privilege.
<P>
	I think there is a suggestion made that there was an attempt to 
deny information to members of Parliament. I am not sure whether 
that is what he is implying. In fact, if that is the implication I think 
it is totally absurd.
<P>
	I want to state clearly, unequivocally and emphatically that there 
is no attempt by me, my staff or my department to deny answers or 
inquiries from any hon. member.
<P>
	I have a great respect for this institution, for Parliament, and in 
particular for my colleagues in the House of Commons on all sides 
of the House. Anyone who knows me would attest to that. It is in 
that spirit that I have directed my department to respond quickly 
and rapidly to members of Parliament on all sides of the House.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Mr. Speaker, could I ask the hon. members to 
listen? They have had their say and I would like to have mine. 
Could I have the courtesy that I accorded to them?
<P>
	On a technicality, I want to make sure you are very clear on this, 
Mr. Speaker. Actually I did not write the directive. The directive to 
which the hon. member for Delta refers was not a directive issued 
from my office but a memo from one of my regional senior 
officials in response to a question of my office. There is no 
question it did come from my office at my request, but I just want 
to make sure the technicalities were clear.
<P>
	The intent of the request was to ensure that members of 
Parliament, and Senators of course who are also members of 
Parliament, receive the information that they need in a timely 
manner. I also wanted to ensure that the departmental officials with 
whom they are dealing are the most qualified and the most 
appropriate people to answer their questions.
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	Sometimes these questions are very difficult. Sometimes the 
questions are complex and deal with complex issues. I wanted to 
ensure, with respect to the supervision of my staff, that the most 
appropriate officials at a senior enough level would direct attention 
to these questions from hon. members.
<P>
	Far from discouraging public servants from speaking to 
members of Parliament, the request was to ensure that members of 
Parliament receive the best possible advice.
<P>
	As the hon. member is well aware, through his many dealings 
with my department, his access to departmental information I 
believe is generous. It is generous, indeed, as it should be. His 
future access to information should in no way be stifled or 
diminished. There is absolutely no intent to do that. As I said 
earlier, it is quite the reverse.
<P>
	I am not, as the member implies, in the business of doing things 
that are not in the interests of this House, whether it is in the House 
during question period, whether it is in discussions or whether it is 
at meetings with hon. members on all sides of the House to answer 
questions they may have. I make myself available and I do not 
think there is a member here who could say otherwise.
<P>
	The hon. member strikes at the heart of the democratic process, 
in my mind, and the business of governance. For a minister to do 
his or her job properly that minister has a responsibility to be aware 
of what people communicate to anybody associated with the 
portfolio. I have a responsibility to the hon. member, to this House 
and to all our constituents to make sure that my department 
responds to these questions in a proper fashion. How would I know 
that has been happening unless I know what is happening with 
respect to the number of queries that have been posed by hon. 
members of this House?
<P>
	I have a reputation for openness. I have no reason to hide 
anything. I have an open department. It has a very close interface 
with the public. It is a very operational department. The request 
from my office, I say in all sincerity and in all seriousness, was 
indeed to ensure that members are accommodated; it was not to 
inhibit them.
<P>
	I am committed and I will continue to be committed to providing 
the best possible service to my colleagues, the elected officials of 
this House.
<P>
	By way of wrapping up the thoughts that I have put forward in 
the last few minutes, the intention when issuing this request to my 
senior officials was to ensure that members of Parliament are the 
recipients of the best, most knowledgeable and most timely 
information when they take the trouble to contact my department. I 
assure all hon. members that their requests will continue to be 
handled in a timely, expert and professional fashion.
<P>
	I can only promise the House that I will continue to keep an open 
ear to all the voices communicating with me or my department, 
including the hon. member and each and every one of his 
colleagues.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We are not dealing with a point of order but a 
point of privilege. This is the situation, as I understand it.
<P>
	We have a letter that was issued which the hon. member, I 
believe, has tabled in this House. The hon. member for Delta has 
read the letter and he has interpreted it in one way.
<P>
	We have now the source, if you will, of the letter; if not the letter 
itself, where the idea came from, the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans who, today in the House in front of all of us has told us 
what the intent of the letter was and why the letter was sent.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7043"> 7043 </A></B>
<P>
	Now we have an interpretation on one side and an explanation 
on the other.
<P>
	Colleagues, I do not want to be trite, but is the glass half full or 
half empty?
<P>
	This, surely, is a matter of looking at things differently, but in my 
view it is not a point of privilege. For this particular matter, with 
this letter at this time, for the hon. member for Delta and for the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, so that they will know and this 
House will know, I find that this is not a matter of privilege.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-70, 
an act to amend the Excise Tax Act, the Federal-Provincial Fiscal 
Arrangements Act, the Income Tax Act, the Debt Servicing and 
Reduction Account Act and related acts, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee; and of the amendment.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to engage in this debate today on behalf 
of the government, speaking in support of Bill C-70, the 
harmonized sales tax. This legislation represents a very important 
first step for the replacement of the goods and services tax with an 
integrated federal-provincial sales tax which is going to be a better 
sales tax system for Canada.
<P>
	On April 1, 1997, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and the province 
of Newfoundland and Labrador will break new ground when the 
retail sales taxes and the GST in those provinces are replaced with 
the new harmonized sales tax. The governments of these three 
provinces are to be commended for their foresight in proceeding 
with the HST. Rather than waiting for the remaining provinces, 
they have put aside the political grandstanding and joined in what 
is a positive initiative for their taxpayers and the consumers in their 
provinces.
<P>
	Next April the three participating provinces will have a simpler, 
less costly and more efficient sales tax system. The bill before us 
today is a distinct improvement over the GST and will represent for 
those three provinces a comparative advantage over the other seven 
provinces.
<P>
	Sales tax under the new system will be charged at a single rate of 
15 per cent on the same tax base as the GST. HST will not apply to 
goods currently not subject to GST, things like basic groceries, 
prescription drugs  and medical services. The benefits to 
consumers are very important.
<P>
	For Nova Scotia and New Brunswick sales tax will drop from a 
combined rate of 18.77 per cent to 15 per cent. In Newfoundland 
and Labrador that rate will decrease from 19.84 per cent to 15 per 
cent.
<P>
	At present the sales tax system in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick 
and Newfoundland and Labrador is cumbersome, costly and 
complicated. The current system inflates prices. Businesses are 
now taxed by the provinces on the items that they buy to run their 
companies. Businesses pay a tax on these inputs. However, 
consumers pay for it in the end because the tax is embedded in the 
final price. Most consumers do not even know about these hidden 
taxes. The sales slip, for example, may say that 11 per cent or 12 
per cent of the purchase price was provincial sales tax. However, a 
significantly higher rate may have been paid because of the taxes 
buried in the final price. About 34 per cent of sales taxes collected 
by the provincial governments are hidden in the price of the goods. 
That is over $700 million worth of hidden taxes. I find that 
unacceptable.
<P>
	Consumers are also paying in reduced jobs and incomes because 
hidden sales taxes drive up the prices of provincial exports, thereby 
making those products less competitive on Canadian and foreign 
markets. All of this changes under integrated value added tax.
<P>
	Harmonization will eliminate the $700 million in hidden 
provincial sales taxes because businesses will be able to claim an 
input tax credit for tax paid on the goods and services bought to 
make their products and run their operation. In other words, 
businesses will no longer pay provincial sales tax during the 
production and distribution process. That means consumers will no 
longer pay provincial sales tax on the provincial sales tax already 
included in the price of goods that they are buying from businesses. 
Instead, tax will apply once and only once on the final sale price of 
a good or service.
<P>
	Consumers will benefit from lower tax rates on most goods, 
lower prices on many goods and knowing the full price before they 
get to the cash register.
<P>
	Consumers will pay tax on a broader range of goods and services 
but the broader base will make it possible to keep the HST at a 
lower level. Including services in the tax base will spread the tax 
burden more evenly across all sectors of the economy. 
Governments must ensure that revenues keep apace with changes 
in the economy.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	Service industries are the fastest growing component of 
expenditures in Canada. Some critics maintain that expanding the 
tax base will mean higher prices but consumers will benefit 
substantially from lower tax rates in each province.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7044"> 7044 </A></B>
<P>
	For Nova Scotia and New Brunswick the new rate will 
effectively be almost four points lower than the current combined 
rate. For Newfoundland and Labrador the new rate will effectively 
be almost five points lower than the current combined rate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As I just said, abolishing the provincial retail sales tax on 
business inputs will enable businesses to recoup the HST paid on 
business purchases, and as a result, these costs will no longer be 
hidden in retail prices.
<P>
	The price of certain goods and services that were not taxed 
before might go up, but this increase will generally represent an 
amount lower than the provincial portion of the HST. Again, this 
will have been made possible by eliminating hidden taxes.
<P>
	The HST will also ensure greater tax fairness for individual 
consumers and families buying various combinations of goods and 
services.

	Evidence indicates that businesses will pass on tax savings in the 
form of lower prices. Past studies done in Canada and other 
countries show that when sales taxes are replaced with value added 
taxes, savings are passed on to consumers.
<P>
	After the introduction of the GST in 1991, prices were monitored 
by the GST consumer information office. Its analysis of changes in 
the consumer price index showed that after adjustments, the 
increase in the CPI attributable to the GST was around 1.1 per cent.
<P>
	The results also showed that overall the old federal sales tax was 
removed from prices and savings for the removal of that tax were 
passed on to consumers. The 1.1 per cent increase attributable to 
the GST was below the estimates the office had made prior to its 
introduction when the estimate was 1.4 per cent increase in overall 
prices, assuming that the savings resulting from the removal of the 
FST were fully passed on to consumers. The increase attributable 
to the GST was 1.5 per cent over the first three-quarters of 1991.
<P>
	These figures included adjustments for inflation and other tax 
changes. After adjustments, prices in 20 out of 46 categories of 
goods and services surveyed had actually gone down when these 
prices were compared with pre-GST prices.
<P>
	Business pass through of tax savings is a direct function of 
competitive markets. Any business that fails to take advantage of 
harmonization to improve its price competitiveness will soon find 
itself priced out of the marketplace. Competition among businesses 
is intense in today's marketplace. If one business can attract more 
customers by reducing prices, other businesses will be forced to 
follow suit in order to stay in business.
<P>
	Studies of the Canadian experience under the GST and those of 
other countries that have adopted a value added  tax model indicate 
that market forces ensure that business savings are fully reflected 
in consumer prices within a very short period of time.
<P>
	Members should know that 18 other countries have value added 
taxes so Canada is not venturing into new territory. The longest 
running value added tax can be found in Australia where it was 
introduced in 1930. Denmark has had a value added tax since 1967, 
France and Germany since 1968 and the U.K. since 1973. One 
might ask: ``Then what is wrong with the GST?'' The answer is 
very simple. Not one of those countries has two contradictory 
co-existing levels of retail sales tax.
<P>
	In introducing the GST, the previous government gave Canada 
one unique characteristic among countries of the world: two retail 
level sales taxes applied on different bases to different goods and 
services, all paid by the consumer on the basis that they have to go 
to the cash register to figure out whether the good is taxable under 
the GST and under the PST, under the GST but not the PST, or 
perhaps not the GST and the PST. Then they must calculate the 
appropriate rate doing the two different calculations to see whether 
it is 7 per cent GST and 8 per cent PST, or perhaps it is 9 per cent 
depending on the province, or if you are fortunate enough to live in 
Alberta, zero per cent PST.
<P>
<B>(1525 )</B>
<P>
	You can see that this is slightly different from a totally 
harmonized sales tax where the consumer picks up the good at the 
counter, goes to the desk and pays the price marked on the good. 
That is progress.
<P>
	With businesses now having to apply, collect and remit HST 
when they sell into a participating province, these goods will not be 
free of provincial sales tax. This means that consumers buying 
locally will not pay any more tax than consumers ordering goods 
from out of province firms.
<P>
	As I say, a key benefit of the HST to consumers will be tax 
inclusive pricing. Consumers across the country have clearly 
indicated their preference to know the full price of an item before 
they actually make a purchase.
<P>
	The days of consumers in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, 
Newfoundland and Labrador calculating taxes mentally, on the 
back of an envelope or having to carry a calculator with them 
before they go to the cash register, will soon be over because the 
sales tax will be included in the price which is what consumers 
across Canada want to have. At the same time, the amount or rate 
of sales tax payable will be visible on receipts and invoices so that 
consumers will still know how much and what tax they are paying.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The flexibility incorporated in the tax inclusive pricing rules will 
reduce unfair competition, since businesses will be able to continue 
posting the before tax price next to the tax inclusive price. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7045"> 7045 </A></B>
<P>
Similarly, participating businesses will not be at a disadvantage 
vis-à-vis the competition from everywhere else.
<P>
	In addition, the federal and provincial governments will work 
together to ensure that consumers are informed of how the tax will 
be included in prices. Participating governments want this process 
to be transparent. Under the tax inclusive pricing scheme, the 
amount paid in tax will be clearly visible on receipts. Consumers 
will know right off how much the goods and services they buy will 
cost because the tax will be visible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Next April consumers in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and 
Newfoundland and Labrador will have substantially lower sales tax 
rates, a simpler sales tax system and lower prices on most goods. 
Would that it be true as well in Ontario. They will also know the 
full price of an item before they get to the cash register. They will 
pay only one tax and they will know how much tax they are paying. 
They will know that their federal and provincial governments are 
working more efficiently by eliminating needless and costly 
duplication.
<P>
	Bill C-70 represents a significant step toward the goal of a fully 
harmonized sales tax system in Canada. I would like to add that the 
federal government and the governments of the three participating 
provinces will not generate any more revenue under the HST than 
they do now under the existing taxes.
<P>
	Harmonization has many supporters. When the announcement 
was first made last April, Nova Scotia's finance minister explained 
this by saying: ``On balance we believe consumers will come out 
ahead. It may cost you $1 more to fill up your tank, but on a $500 
car repair bill you will save more than $20 in tax. You may pay $1 
more for a haircut but you will save a buck when you buy shampoo, 
soap and toothpaste''.
<P>
	An excerpt last April from a press release issued by the Certified 
General Accountants Association said: ``There is no question that 
today's announcement with Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and New 
Brunswick will be a tremendous shot in the arm for consumers in 
those provinces''.
<P>
	Rosalie Daly Todd, Consumers Association executive director 
had this to say: ``Consumers will no longer have to guess at the 
total cost of their purchase, a situation which has been the source of 
frustration for many people. At the same time, listing the amount of 
tax on the bill or receipt keeps the tax visible and the tax makers 
accountable to consumers''.
<P>
	Newfoundland's finance minister is quoted as saying last April: 
``Taxpayers would have $105 million more to spend, save or invest 
and there would be significantly lower after tax prices on a wide 
range of goods and services, and significantly less tax paid by the 
people of the province''.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	In October, Elizabeth Beale, Atlantic Provinces Economic 
Council president, was quoted as saying: ``The HST will be an 
improvement on a number of fronts. Consumers should see relief in 
the total level of taxation dropping on a whole range of products''.
<P>
	APEC recently issued a report that was highly supportive of 
sales tax harmonization. It identified significant economic and 
administrative efficiency benefits to the harmonizing provinces. 
That is the reason the premiers of the three Atlantic provinces have 
bought advertising space in newspapers displaying the Atlantic 
advantage: no sales tax in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and 
Newfoundland and Labrador.
<P>
	It is time that the other provinces also got on board with the 
harmonized sales tax. This is the tax of the future. This is a fairer 
tax. This is an easier tax for business to administer. It is a more 
understandable tax for consumers. I do not understand why a 
government of a province in Canada would be unwilling to move 
forward with a measure that is so much in the interests of its 
taxpayers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to congratulate the Minister of Industry on his fine defence of 
the harmonized sales tax. I will make a few comments and ask a 
few questions along the way.
<P>
	I seem to recall that when I served on the Standing Committee on 
Finance three years ago and we were looking at the GST 
replacement, I reviewed what the Liberals said when in opposition. 
I found that the minister was a member of the Standing Committee 
on Finance at that time, or at least a member of a group that 
submitted a minority report to the government of the day 
suggesting a solution to the manufacturers sales tax which was not 
a goods and services tax. It was not the GST. He opposed the GST. I 
seem to recall that he supported something completely different 
which was more along the lines of the single tax that the member 
for Broadview-Greenwood was proposing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> No way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Okay, I need clarification on that but I know there 
was something different. I do not want to put words in his mouth 
but I would like to know what it is he recommended at that time. I 
do know that he was against the GST.
<P>
	In his speech the minister indicated that this was an 
improvement over the GST. How is it an improvement when the 
GST has not changed? All the inherent problems are still there. In 
fact that party during the election campaign promised to scrap, to 
kill, to abolish the GST and then tried to weasel its way out of that. 
But let us say to even replace the GST with something which is 
revenue neutral, the Liberals have failed on both counts.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7046"> 7046 </A></B>
<P>
	On the first count, the Liberals did not scrap or replace the GST. 
In fact they have entrenched the GST into our lives forever 
because now they have harmonized it with a provincial sales tax 
and there will be no future provincial government that will ever 
want to give up that source of revenue, especially at the high rate 
of 15 per cent. All the inherent problems of the GST will still 
exist. Exempt or not exempt, zero rated, all these different rules 
will still be there and will still cause problems.
<P>
	Second, during his speech the minister said that the new 
harmonized tax will not increase revenues for the government. We 
all know it decreases revenues for the provincial governments 
because of the drop in their PST. In their red book the Liberals 
promised they would replace the GST with something that was 
revenue neutral.
<P>
	If what he said in his speech is true, that this is revenue neutral, 
no more revenue to the government, which means no less revenue 
to the federal government, it is going to cost the federal 
government $961 million as a payment to the three participating 
Atlantic provinces. It means that this new tax is not revenue 
neutral, it is revenue deficient and therefore it is going to cost the 
taxpayers money.
<P>
	Finally, I find this to be somewhat like the minister of myth. The 
finance minister likes to brag about the ads on the Atlantic 
advantage. How can the provincial premiers say there is no sales 
tax when there is a GST which represents the goods and services 
tax of 15 per cent?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
questions. Other than confusing my interest in a system of tax 
which he later supported, he asked good questions. Let me begin at 
the end of his comments.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	In order to understand the impact of a retail sales tax such as the 
provincial retail sales tax on the consumer, one must understand 
why the Atlantic premiers claim there is no sales tax. What 
happens with the existing retail sales tax is that not only is it 
applied to the price of the goods that are purchased, but it is 
embedded in the cost of every item produced and every service 
generated by a business in a province with that kind of tax.
<P>
	Take the classic case of the barber shop which everyone likes to 
talk about. People say there is no tax on haircuts. Who do they 
think pays the tax that the barber paid when he bought his barber 
chairs? Who pays the tax that the barber paid when he bought all 
his hairdressing equipment? Who pays the tax that the barber paid 
when he bought all of the other services that are necessary for him 
to render his hair cutting service? It is embedded in the price of the 
haircut.
<P>
	If we take the case of another business that is producing a good, 
then again the provincial sales tax systems as they exist in 
Canadian provinces cause a cascading of the tax. Every time in 
every stage of  production tax is paid by the business on inputs, it is 
embedded in the price of the good that the business sells. Tax is 
applied to that, which includes tax on the tax previously paid, and 
so on down the chain.
<P>
	Under the harmonized sales tax, all of that is eliminated. When a 
business sells a good to a consumer, the only sales tax is the sales 
tax that is applied at the retail level. There is no sales tax embedded 
in the original price of the good. That is why the Atlantic premiers 
can say with pride that there is no sales tax, because they have 
managed a system that is clean when the good is finally sold to the 
consumer. The consumer knows that the sales tax component he 
pays on that good is 15 per cent. It is demonstrated on the bill. 
There is no hidden sales tax. There is no hidden tax on a good in the 
Atlantic provinces.
<P>
	Once again the member suggests, and the Reform Party has tried 
to make something out of this for several months, that somehow 
the red book did not represent this party's election promises in 
1993. That of course is something the Reform Party did not try to 
proclaim at the time. Reformers were given the red book as were 
other opposition parties. Our promises were plainly made and they 
have been fulfilled.
<P>
	If the hon. member wonders why we opposed the GST in 1989 
and 1990, then I commend to him the report that we wrote. 
Circumstances have to be dealt with as they are found at the time. 
We recommended against implementing this tax for some of the 
same reasons that we are trying to fix it now.
<P>
	As I spoke of earlier, with two sales taxes at the retail level, it is 
the only jurisdiction in the western world that has tried to do that. It 
was not a good idea. It was confusing. It was predictable that we 
would have the tax chaos which resulted. But there was no turning 
back the clock and saying we wished it had never happened and let 
us go back to the old sales tax and begin with that. Time had moved 
on.
<P>
	When the Liberals campaigned in 1993 we made it very clear 
what we would do. Given the reality that the government of the day 
had already imposed the GST and that the introduction of the tax 
had been absorbed in the economy, we said that we would have the 
finance committee study it in the first year of government and 
prepare a report on how we might move forward to produce a better 
tax that would be harmonized with provincial sales taxes.
<P>
	It is disingenuous of the hon. member to suggest that he can take 
things out of a 1990 debate in the House of Commons before the 
law was enacted, before the tax was imposed, before the retail 
community had to make the adjustments in order to apply the tax, 
before the manufacturers sales tax had been withdrawn and use 
them in debate in 1996 when we are trying to make the mess we 
found liveable for retailers and consumers. It might be good 
political rhetoric but it is not precisely what the hon. member 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7047"> 7047 </A></B>
<P>
would like to be identified with in putting real and substantial 
choices before the Canadian public as we move on from here.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 1993 
in Wild Rose the campaign was hot and heavy. ``We will scrap, we 
will kill, we will abolish the GST'', were the words I heard.
<P>
	I am pleased to see a front line minister speaking to this issue. I 
also noticed that another front line minister, the former minister of 
revenue who is now the Minister of Transport, made a prediction in 
a Victoria newspaper where he said that voters will punish any 
provincial government that fails to merge its sales tax with a 
revamped goods and services tax. If that be the case, then why in 
Prince Edward Island, where the Liberals were pushing for this 
merger of taxes, were they so soundly defeated?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> Mr. Speaker, I found it a little hard to follow the 
question since Prince Edward Island is not one of the provinces that 
adopted the harmonized sales tax. One might argue that had they 
done so, they would have been re-elected.
<P>
	I would like to take the opportunity to refer to the comments that 
were made by hon. members opposite with respect to compensation 
paid to the Atlantic provinces in order to make this transfer. Any 
time a transition is made on a very substantive policy issue, 
transition payments are often considered.
<P>
	I point out to hon. members opposite that when the government 
moved to eliminate the transportation subsidy under the Western 
Grain Transportation Act, popularly known as the Crow rate, a full 
$1.6 billion was made available to western farmers in order to 
compensate them for this important transition. It was painful, there 
is no doubt about it. In the long term it is the correct policy, the best 
policy for the economy of Canada. It is the best policy for western 
Canada and the best policy for the western Canadian farmers who 
are making the adjustment. Never once did that party get up and 
criticize compensation being paid to western Canada.
<P>
	How is it when another important change is made which is good 
for the economy of Canada and good for the economy of Atlantic 
Canada and has short term cost implications for the provinces 
involved that a one time transition payment is so offensive to that 
party? It sounds to me like the petty politics of regional envy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to address or undress this government on its proposed legislation 
for a harmonized sales tax and to streamline the GST under Bill 
C-70.
<P>
	First, I have a little humour that might put this in perspective. A 
good friend of mine in Calgary, Martin Struthers, is a travelling 
salesman in the clothing line. He  told me that he ran into a lot of 
Liberals over the summertime on the golf course. They were 
playing with a particularly cute golf ball that had the logo of the 
current Deputy Prime Minister on it. When he asked the Liberals 
why they were using this golf ball they said: ``Well if we use this 
golf ball, we are free to change our lie any time''.
<P>
	On November 29, 1996 the government boldly issued a press 
release announcing that three Atlantic provinces, Nova Scotia, 
New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador, had agreed to 
harmonize the GST and provincial sales tax effective April 1, 1997. 
The effective date is important. It is next year, not this year. I will 
come back to that later on in my speech.
<P>
	The finance minister is quoted as saying: ``This proposed 
legislation represents another step toward an integrated national 
sales tax system for Canada''. I stand before this House to state 
unequivocally that this comment by the finance minister is 
misleading, that the steps he has taken to harmonize the GST are 
hypocritical and that this whole exercise is nothing more than 
politically self-serving by Liberals at its worst. These are the three 
arguments I wish to address and I will do so under those titles: 
misleading, hypocritical and politically self-serving.
<P>
	Under misleading, it is misleading that the rest of the country 
will not participate in the harmonized sales tax system even though 
the finance minister says that this is leading toward it. P.E.I. 
dropped out. Ontario has said to take a hike. Alberta wants the net 
effective rate that the Atlantic provinces get, which is 5.5 per cent. 
His whole claim that he is moving forward contradicts the facts.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	Take Ontario. Why would Ontario comply when it has already 
indicated that it would cost Ontario consumers another $2 billion in 
goods and services with a combined rate? Why would Mike Harris 
want to punish Ontarians just to play politics with the 99 Liberals 
who are doing very little for Ontario, other than downloading their 
problems in health care, education and welfare, increasing taxes 
through the elimination of certain loopholes and tinkering with the 
corporate rate structure?
<P>
	On top of that, the government's share of the billion dollar bribe 
to entice the three provinces to participate is going to cost $400 
million over three to four years.
<P>
	It is misleading for it to claim it is making progress when only 
three provinces out of ten are participating.
<P>
	The finance minister has failed to get the other provinces to 
participate. Why? It is a tax increase on consumers. Even the 
department of finance of Nova Scotia, one of the participants, in its 
analysis of May 1996 revealed that the net effect of the harmonized 
sales tax burden on consumers would increase by $80 million. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7048"> 7048 </A></B>
<P>
Retailers, especially national retailers in the region, claim  that 
their extra costs to retain a dual system of taxation for those stores 
within the three provinces and for those outside will cost them $27 
million.
<P>
	The government claims, in defence, that businesses will pass on 
any portion of their savings achieved through harmonization. 
Excuse me, based on what prior evidence? There will be a $107 
million increase to consumers in Atlantic Canada. That is what will 
happen through a reflection of price increases. A billion dollars has 
been taken from the federal coffers, from the rest of Canada, to 
transfer the system.
<P>
	It is misleading to state that the Reform Party supports 
harmonization. In the Standing Committee on Finance, of which I 
was a member and one of the co-authors of the report, when the 
government was looking for a GST replacement we indicated quite 
strongly that if the government was going to harmonize it had to 
harmonize on a national basis, with all the provinces, at the same 
time, and make it revenue neutral, with the widest possible base, 
providing the lowest rate. That has not been achieved. Other 
provinces will not participate. We clearly stated in our executive 
summary that harmonization cannot be fully endorsed. Talk about 
being misquoted and taken out of context.
<P>
	Therefore we oppose the harmonized sales tax in its present 
form. If the government would bring us something which is for all 
of Canada we would consider it.
<P>
	It is misleading to claim that this will save money when it will 
cost the rest of the provinces close to $1 billion, $961 million to be 
exact. We call it a bribe to compensate the provinces for the lost 
revenue of the lower PST and to entice them to participate.
<P>
	That is very misleading. Who is going to compensate the other 
provinces, entice them or bribe them? Where is the money going to 
come from to provide the lost revenue for the other provinces, such 
as Saskatchewan, as the member previously mentioned?
<P>
	This move is also hypocritical. I will touch on this point briefly. 
When in opposition the finance minister said: ``I would abolish the 
GST because the manufacturers sales tax is a bad tax, but there is 
no excuse to repeal one bad thing by bringing in another''. That 
appeared in the April 4, 1990 edition of the Montreal <I>Gazette</I>.
<P>
	On March 17, 1990 in an interview with the Calgary <I>Herald</I> the 
finance minister said that the GST is a tax which discriminates 
against the regions and that he would get rid of it if possible. 
However, he said it would be difficult to do that if the federal tax 
becomes integrated with provincial taxes: ``If it becomes 
integrated'', which the government is now bragging about, ``with 
provincial taxes'', which it has just done, ``we will never get rid of 
the GST. We will never replace the GST''.
<P>
	He further said that another alternative would be to look at 
alternative consumption taxes that are not regressive and do not 
penalize the regions of the country.
<P>
	We are talking about the hypocrisy of the finance minister's 
statements. The hypocrisy lies in the fact that he has acted exactly 
opposite to what he said in opposition and opposite to what his 
personal beliefs are. He has entrenched the GST instead of getting 
rid of it. He has also introduced a taxation system which penalizes 
the non-participating provinces to the tune of $961 million. He is 
making seven provinces pay for lower tax rates in three provinces 
and basically penalizing the rest of the country just to integrate a 
bad tax, which he said he would never do. His deal is with three 
provinces that have Liberal premiers, three provinces that may 
soon have three Conservative premiers once this ripples through 
the economy of those three provinces.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	We do not need to remind everybody what happened in P.E.I. My 
colleague from Wild Rose has already pointed that out. That 
Liberal premier lost his job thanks in great part to the federal 
Liberal government and its action in this regard.
<P>
	I believe it is also hypocritical to argue that the Liberals have a 
pan-Canadian view of Canada because they are taking from the 
richer provinces and giving to the poor. Is this a new definition now 
of equalization payments where seven provinces are paying for ten, 
a complete reversal of the current equalization system where three 
provinces pay for seven?
<P>
	It seems to me there is hope for Reform's fresh start platform. 
We suggest that we should review the equalization payment system 
and have maybe the top five provinces paying the bottom five and 
have a little competition in there which would be a better approach 
to a new vision for a better Canada.
<P>
	Finally, I also feel that the harmonized sales tax is politically 
self-serving. We all know the promises from the Deputy Prime 
Minister, the Prime Minister to the finance minister and a whole 
bunch of other MPs during the campaign about what they said at 
the door and also what is in the red book. They have not even kept 
their red book promise because this is a partial and it is not even 
revenue neutral and any way you cut it they have broken their 
promise.
<P>
	We all know about the member for York South-Weston who has 
quit over this because of principle. We all know about the member 
for Broadview-Greenwood. What these people campaigned on 
and what they delivered are two different things.
<P>
	In order to limit the damage and in order to continue the myth 
that they are solving and keeping their red book promises they have 
introduced this GST harmonization at a huge cost to the country, at 
a great disservice to the premiers of those three provinces who 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7049"> 7049 </A></B>
<P>
were hoodwinked, bribed and misled and where the Atlantic 
residents will see their cost of living go higher.
<P>
	The finance minister has admitted that he failed to deliver on his 
promise to scrap the GST. The Deputy Prime Minister admitted 
they have not delivered on their promise and quit subsequently. She 
never promised that she would run again but she did and she got 
re-elected.
<P>
	The only person who fails to admit that they failed to deliver on 
their election promise is the Prime Minister who is off around the 
countryside taking credit for all the global deals, thanks to 
businessmen who have been working hard for five years and thanks 
to the previous government that fought hard and implemented free 
trade and the North American Free Trade Agreement.
<P>
	This harmonized sales tax is politically self-serving because they 
have told the Atlantic MPs to keep quiet. Why are they not 
speaking out on this and telling us how wonderful it is and how 
great it is? Why do they not go on the record and tell Atlantic 
Canadians that this is the best thing since sliced bread and there is 
no sales tax in the Atlantic provinces? It has disappeared. The ads 
are there. Defend that. I would like to see them defend that. I would 
enjoy listening to them defend that there is now no sales tax in 
these three provinces.
<P>
	There will be businesses going under in the Minister of National 
Defence's riding. They have already shut their doors. These 
Atlantic MPs have been told to stay quiet. Where are they? How 
can all of them say this is a good deal in light of all the people who 
have come forward and said this is not a good deal, especially 
MMG Management Group which runs discount chains under 
names like Greenberg, Red Apple, MetMart and Metropolitan in 
New Brunswick where 79 jobs have already been lost due to this 
harmonization and a 50-50 chance of another 71 jobs being lost 
according to their own calculations?
<P>
	The worst example of all that I have of political self-serving is 
contained in the Public Accounts, volume 1, pages 1.24 to pages 
1.26. It talks about the whole financial aspect of accounting and 
also the auditor general's comments: ``Responsibility for the 
integrity and objectivity of the financial statements rests with the 
government. The financial statements are prepared under the joint 
direction of the President of the Treasury Board, the Minister of 
Finance and the Receiver General for Canada in compliance with 
governing legislation''.
<P>
	The auditor general then gives his comments. Here are some of 
his startling concerns that he felt should be brought to the House 
and parliamentarians made aware of: ``The inclusion of transitional 
assistance'', which is the same debt word as bribe, ``of $961 
million in the 1996 deficit and accumulated deficit represents a 
departure from both sound accounting practice and the 
government's own accounting rules. In my opinion the transitional 
assistance of $961 million should be included in the deficit
<P>
subsequent to the 1995-96 fiscal year. Failure to comply with 
generally accepted principles resulted in an overstatement by the 
annual deficit and accumulated deficit of $961 million''.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. The hon. 
member purports to be quoting from the auditor general's report 
and he made reference to the word bribe. I would like to know if 
that is part of what he is quoting from the auditor general. If not, 
would he excise that and read the quote again without that word in 
it.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I think the hon. member is 
raising a question to the member for Calgary Centre. However, if 
he wishes to clarify the matter, I am sure he would be pleased to do 
so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will clarify. I thank the hon. member 
for the correction. I did kind of ad lib. The word bribe is not in the 
report.
<P>
	Here are his startling concerns: ``The inclusion of transitional 
assistance of $961 million in the 1996 deficit and accumulated 
deficit represents a departure from both sound accounting practice 
and the government's own accounting rules. In my opinion the 
transitional assistance of $961 million should be included in the 
deficit subsequent to the 1995-96 fiscal year. Failure to comply 
with generally accepted practices resulted in an overstatement of 
the annual deficit and accumulated deficit of $961 million''.
<P>
	The transitional assistance of $961 million has been recorded as 
a liability at March 31, 1996 and as an expenditure, a resultant 
increase in the deficit for the 1995-96 fiscal year.
<P>
	As I said at the outset of my intervention this afternoon, this 
agreement does not come into effect until April 1, 1997, two fiscal 
years later, the year ending 1997-98.
<P>
	Is this bribe or transitional assistance, as the government prefers 
to refer to it, a liability as of March 31, 1996? Clearly this is not the 
case because according to generally accepted accounting principles 
and the government's own rules: ``Financial obligations are 
recorded as liabilities if the underlying event occurred prior to or at 
year end''. It did not occur prior to March 31, 1996 and it did not 
occur at year end March 31, 1996. In fact, it is occurring now. 
Agreements are being signed now and they will take effect April 1, 
1997, which is the next fiscal year, not even in this one ending in 
1997.
<P>
	Also: ``Transfer payments are recorded as expenditures when 
paid and when the recipient has fulfilled the terms of a contractual 
transfer agreement''. Clearly this is not the case. They have not 
fulfilled the terms of the contractual agreement. The auditor 
general agrees with me because he states in the Public Accounts: 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7050"> 7050 </A></B>
<P>
``Eligibility criteria had not been met by the three provinces by 
March 31, 1996 and, accordingly, the $961  million of 
compensation should not have been recorded in the accounts at that 
time. Although the government is committed to compensating the 
provinces once agreements are signed, the $961 million is not 
payable until the agreements are signed''.
<P>
	The government and its officials hung their hats on 
memorandums of understanding. Mr. Speaker, I know you were an 
outstanding lawyer when you where practising and know the terms 
of law very well. You and I both know that letters of agreement, 
memorandums of understanding have a certain way of sometimes 
changing. That is why the auditor general is right. That is why 
generally accepted accounting principles cannot be departed from. 
Shame.
<P>
	The integrity of government financial statements is at stake. This 
action on harmonization impairs the integrity of the process. 
Shame. Shame on the finance minister, the deputy finance minister, 
the President of the Treasury Board, the secretary of the Treasury 
Board and the receiver general and the deputy receiver general, 
who have all compromised some integrity, walking a fine line on 
interpreting generally accepted accounting principles and prior 
government practices, setting a new precedent just to help the 
Liberals fulfil a self-serving political promise and to help the 
finance minister bury the high cost of harmonization in a prior year 
ending in 1996 just because the government had bettered its deficit 
target and done better than it had projected in that year. Therefore 
this was a good time to bury it, hide it and then forget about it and 
we will not have to record this transition cost, this bribe, this 
enticement, whatever anybody wants to refer to it as. This is 
nothing more than political self-serving and I say shame.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	I have given examples and testimony to prove conclusively that 
this feeble, partial, half-hearted effort of replacing the GST with 
something that is revenue neutral is not. I quote from the red book. 
I am trying to interpret legitimately, accurately what the Liberals 
now say they promised door to door.
<P>
	Knock, knock. Hi, I am the member for 
Broadview-Greenwood. I will replace the GST with a tax that is 
revenue neutral, that will take as much money out of pockets as it 
does now and then we never worry about the GST again. That is 
what the Liberals said they promised. I believe with the examples I 
have given I have pointed out how misleading, hypocritical and 
self-serving have been their remarks for a period of four years.
<P>
	This is an important issue. The GST is a bad tax. In and of itself 
it can be good in terms of consumption taxes. But when it was 
introduced the Liberals in opposition argued against it, as they 
should have. Now that they are the government they promised to 
get rid of it. They have not. They have entrenched it.
<P>
	Most everyone acknowledges that the GST has been the biggest 
cause of the growth in the underground economy. How is it then 
that by entrenching a 15 per cent tax is going to eliminate the 
growth in that economy and eliminate the activity within that 
economy?
<P>
	The Liberals brag about how this is a step in the right direction, 
how this will replace the GST and be revenue neutral. We will still 
have the high cost of administration of the GST type of tax that we 
had. Reformers feel that the government should get out of this 
domain altogether, leave it to the provinces. The $15 billion net 
revenue required should be put into a simplified tax system 
featuring a dual rate. That is how to raise that revenue. That is 
simplifying it. That is eliminating the GST. That is making it 
revenue neutral. That is solving the problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will use the same themes that the 
hon. member opposite used: misleading, hypocritical and 
self-serving but I will throw them back at him.
<P>
	The hon. member is misleading the Canadian people. The 
auditor general did not qualify the financial statements of the 
Government of Canada. He made an observation. We disagree 
about that observation. That is entirely permissible and within what 
is appropriate under generally accepted accounting standards. The 
hon. member knows that.
<P>
	The hon. member also said the tax is not revenue neutral. I ask 
him to prove that. That is untrue, it is revenue neutral.
<P>
	It is interesting under hypocritical. I had the privilege to work 
with the hon. member. He worked diligently with other members of 
his party on the committee that went across the country looking 
into replacements for the GST. I will tell who is hypocritical. The 
hon. member supports harmonization. He neglected to tell us that.
<P>
	Under self-serving, it is interesting. The hon. member attacks the 
transitional assistance but I have never heard him attack the $1.6 
billion paid to western grain farmers when the Crow rate subsidy 
was removed. Not a word. Here we have a member from one region 
of the country criticizing transitional assistance going to another 
area of the country and telling them what is good for them but 
never rising to criticize similar transitional assistance in his own 
backyard.
<P>
	This is a quiz show if you will, Mr. Speaker. I ask the hon. 
member one further question. Who said the following? ``I want 
something that works. If we had one value added tax, one base, one 
bureaucracy to collect it, the manufacturers and businesses in 
Ontario would save over $1 billion by being able to deduct those 
costs that cannot be deducted today on the sales tax. It has been one 
of the areas of a major competitive disadvantage that Ontario 
manufacturers have had and Ontario businesses have had. I say 
stop the rhetoric, stop the politics, stop  the finger pointing. Get on 
with harmonization and simplification of the GST or whatever the 
new initials are, along with the PST''. Who said that? I will give the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7051"> 7051 </A></B>
<P>
hon. member a hint. He is now the premier of the province of 
Ontario.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
intervention. I will try to answer his comments about my 
misleading the public and that the auditor general did not qualify 
his observations in his signing off on the financial statements.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	I agree with the hon. member. He did not make a reservation on 
it because he said: ``Substantially the changes and effect that would 
occur that year might happen but the significance would happen 
and those looking at the Government of Canada from afar would be 
able to recognize that that is the intent of the government''. 
However, he did make it clear and spent a lot of effort in pointing it 
out to us, notwithstanding that he did not make a reservation on it 
and signed off.
<P>
	The point is that if we start allowing politicians to do things with 
financial statements that go to the edge of generally accepted 
accounting principles, integrity is at stake. When you go against 
the history of 126 years in Parliament, which has never been done 
before, of taking something that has not been consummated, that 
may lead to a deal down the road and charge it off to prior years-
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy: </B>Gobbledegook.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> No, that is not poppycock. That is exactly what has 
happened and that is what the auditor general is making us aware 
of. We should be aware of it so that this kind of stuff will not be 
allowed to happen.
<P>
	I am not misleading. I acknowledge that there was not a 
reservation. I just did not put it in my speech. Am I misleading by 
saying it is not revenue neutral? I accept the claim that it will 
generate the same amount of money as is currently being generated 
by the GST but there is a cost to setting up this new system.
<P>
	When the Liberal red book stated that they would replace the 
GST with something revenue neutral, they did not say at a cost of 
$1 billion or $2 billion or $100 million. There was no cost to it. I 
assumed and I think most Canadians assumed that they would 
replace it with something that does the same. If it was supposed to 
save money in administration and in efficiency and if it saved 
money for businesses and governments, it should not cost us a 
billion dollars. We know why it cost us a billion dollars. It was 
either a bribe, an enticement or a transitionary cost. Any one of 
those three can be picked. I know the government will take the 
transitionary cost.
<P>
	We have never supported harmonization. He and I were on the 
committee. The minority report of the Reform Party on replacing 
the GST clearly stated in its executive summary, right from the 
beginning to the end, that: ``Harmonization cannot be fully 
endorsed. While harmonization does simplify the tax system, it 
makes no sense to do it in a piecemeal, ad hoc fashion because it 
simply increases the confusion, the cost and the resentment across 
the country''. That is what the government is doing.
<P>
	The purpose is to eliminate dual tax regimes but this version 
retains it for national firms. The Reform Party opposes tax 
inclusive pricing. This practice violates the principle of open 
taxation which is essential to efficient functioning of open 
democracies. The disclosure of taxes paid on cash register receipts 
preserves an element of openness in taxation but as the experience 
in Europe has shown, it eventually results in strongly diminished 
public awareness of the tax.
<P>
	The Reform Party sees the GST as an unnecessary temporary tax 
which does not belong in the federal domain, but inasmuch as the 
tax will exist temporarily, then the Reform Party encourages the 
government to streamline taxation, remove as many of the 
significant problems that exist until such time as a much wider tax 
reform that provides both tax relief and tax simplification can be 
implemented.
<P>
	If the government presented a national integrated sales tax with 
the lowest possible rate on the broadest possible base, the Reform 
Party would seriously consider looking at such a proposal. 
However, the government is not doing that. This is a piecemeal, ad 
hoc presentation. This would be only conditional consideration 
because the Reform Party's final solution to the GST, as I 
mentioned earlier, would be to eliminate the GST after the budget 
is balanced, incorporate the net revenue required into a simplified 
tax system featuring a dual rate.
<P>
	I think I have addressed the issues of the hon. member of being 
misleading and hypocritical. I welcome that. If I challenge them for 
being misleading and hypocritical they have the right to accuse me 
of the same. I have, unlike the government, addressed each of those 
items and have given my answers. I would now like the hon. 
member, if there is a minute left, to tell me if I am still misleading 
and hypocritical in light of my answers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was pleased to hear the hon. 
member say that in the minority report they did endorse 
harmonization, although not without some qualifications. At least 
we have that much on the record because he neglected to say that 
they support the principle of harmonization. I thank him for that 
clarification.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to further add, so that the 
member does truly understand, we would eliminate the GST unlike 
his government. Given, however, that the GST is going to be 
around for another three years or so, if it is possible to improve the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7052"> 7052 </A></B>
<P>
tax  regime and eliminate and simplify and reduce taxes, then we 
would support the government in measures like that.
<P>
	But as an overall philosophy this party does not and will not 
support the harmonized sales tax in the present form that this 
government has put forward.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Halifax.
<P>
	I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on Bill C-70 
respecting the harmonized sales tax agreement. I have listened 
closely to the debate today and some of the criticisms that members 
from parties opposite have raised.
<P>
	Let me take a moment and read a number of quotes from national 
organizations regarding the need to move on to a harmonized tax 
system. In June 1994 the president of the Retail Council of Canada 
stated in an interview: ``Harmonization is abundantly desirable. 
The provinces cannot ignore forever the pressures that are on us as 
a nation to get our House in order and getting the sales tax right is 
an important element of that''.
<P>
	In the same month the president of the Canadian Chamber of 
Commerce said: ``They,'' meaning businesses ``could create more 
jobs if the PST and the GST were integrated by doing more 
business more efficiently and more effectively''.
<P>
	Even the members of the third party, and we heard that from 
debate here, supported harmonization in the minority report on 
replacement of the GST. In that report they said: ``It is simply 
unacceptable that Canada remains the only country in the world 
with 10 different sales tax regimes. We commend the government 
on its attempt to harmonize the tax with the provinces''. That is 
exactly what the government is working toward.
<P>
	As the House is aware, on October 23 three provinces, Nova 
Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador, signed a 
harmonization deal with the federal government, In doing so, these 
provinces have taken a bold step forward. It is a step that will help 
the three Atlantic provinces to become more competitive, more 
self-sufficient and more attractive for businesses.
<P>
	In signing this deal, the province of Nova Scotia and its two 
partners are leading the way to what I believe will be an eventual 
agreement among the provinces and territories. Let us look at the 
facts. Over its lifetime the GST has taken an additional $3 billion 
out of the Atlantic region, a bigger increase in federal sales tax 
payments than in any other part of Canada. In signing this 
agreement these three provinces will receive adjustment assistance 
close to $1 billion over four years.
<P>
	I have heard the criticisms from members opposite on this 
element of the deal. I would like to remind my colleagues, 
however, that this decision is consistent with Canada's long 
standing principle of providing adjustment  assistance to provinces 
and individuals when they need help adjusting to major policy 
changes initiated by the federal government.
<P>
	I want to emphasize quite clearly what the agreement will mean 
to Nova Scotia. In Nova Scotia the harmonized sales tax agreement 
will improve its economy and its competitive position vis-à-vis 
other provinces. The agreement will ensure that $100 million more 
will be left in the pockets of Nova Scotians. This extra money in 
the economy will mean a permanent increase in Nova Scotia's 
gross domestic product of .8 per cent. Over the next few years that 
will translate into approximately 3,000 new jobs.
<P>
	A central component of the sales tax reform is that the new 
system must be both fair and simple to use. The HST meets both of 
these criteria. Consumers and business people will operate in a 
marketplace where the rules are clear and where there is less 
paperwork.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	For consumers, all Nova Scotians will benefit from a tax rate 
that is almost four points lower than the current combined rate. The 
new system will mean lower prices on most goods, not only 
because the combined rate will be lower, but also because hidden 
provincial sales taxes will be eliminated.
<P>
	As well, businesses in Nova Scotia will experience many 
competitive advantages under this new system. With full input tax 
credits, operating costs on everything from phone bills to 
computers will come down. Many other business expenses will 
also be lower, including hotel and meeting costs. This will provide 
an opportunity for local businesses to expand and to grow, and that 
is what this is all about. It also gives businesses an excellent reason 
to locate in my province of Nova Scotia.
<P>
	For businesses the HST will mean they will only have to 
administer one tax instead of two; one collector, one auditor. 
Businesses have campaigned for a simpler administration system 
for many years. As of April 1 next year, we will be able to deliver.
<P>
	I would like to turn for a moment to a number of specific sectors.
<P>
	Let us look at the issue of tax rebates on books. During the 
summer months I heard from many businesses and individuals in 
my constituency of Annapolis Valley-Hants. They were calling 
for an exemption on the taxation of books. The message I heard 
was that the continued taxation on books was in effect an 
impediment to promoting and improving literacy in Canada. This is 
a view that I brought forward to the Minister of Finance in early 
August on numerous occasions. I was pleased therefore when the 
minister responded positively to these concerns.
<P>
	Under the HST there will be 100 per cent GST rebate on all 
books purchased by public libraries, schools, universities, colleges, 
municipalities and qualifying charities and non-profit orga-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7053"> 7053 </A></B>
<P>
nizations. That clearly is the way to go. This rebate will support the 
important role played by these front line organizations in helping 
individuals acquire the tools they need to learn to read or to 
improve their reading ability.
<P>
	During this time of limited resources the best way to ensure the 
biggest impact for every dollar spent is to target assistance which 
will have the most impact on literacy. This decision will have a 
positive impact in supporting literacy in Nova Scotia.
<P>
	I also want to speak for a moment about how this agreement will 
positively affect the housing industry. After all, a strong 
component in any economy is a strong housing industry. While 
provincial sales tax does not apply directly to the sales or rental of 
residential property, a substantial amount of provincial retail tax is 
still embedded in housing prices. Consumers are paying for 
unrecoverable tax on materials such as lumber, paint and 
appliances. As well, contractors pay provincial sales tax on 
building equipment and other capital goods.
<P>
	Under the HST, builders will be entitled to input tax credits on 
inputs used in the building of a home. That is important. In addition 
to that, in Nova Scotia under the HST there will be a housing rebate 
for all buyers of new homes to a maximum of $2,250. Coupled with 
decreased building material costs this will ensure that new homes 
cost the same or less once the new agreement is in place.
<P>
	Let us turn to the tourism industry for a moment. In Nova Scotia, 
as I am sure everyone is well aware, tourism is a billion dollar a 
year industry. In my riding of Annapolis Valley-Hants, tourism is 
a growing area and one in which jobs can and will be created.
<P>
	Under this agreement visitors from outside Canada will get their 
tax back on hotels, conventions, bed and breakfasts and on the gifts 
they take home to their families. Even visitors from other 
provinces will face a lower tax rate for meals and for 
accommodations. Clearly this agreement will make our tourism 
sector even more competitive and more successful.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	As any government whether federal, provincial or municipal can 
say, tax reform is never an easy process. Any attempt to change and 
improve the tax system will inevitably lead to criticism and calls to 
leave things as they are. But I believe the agreement our 
government has reached with the three Atlantic provinces will 
improve the economy of Nova Scotia and will free up more money 
for Nova Scotian families and businesses.
<P>
	This package will help create jobs and it will help the economy 
grow over the long term. For those provinces that have taken the 
lead and signed on to this agreement, they will become more 
competitive both nationally and globally.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, some 
information has been supplied to me regarding some comments 
about this whole idea.
<P>
	The Retail Council of Canada has said that by forcing stores to 
bury the new tax in prices, the harmonized tax regime will cost 
retailers at least $100 million a year. A study by Ernst and Young, 
the government's own accounting firm, estimated that a midsized 
national chain with 50 stores in the Atlantic provinces would pay 
up to $3 million in a one-time start up and $1.1 million a year to 
comply with this new system.
<P>
	The Halifax Chamber of Commerce has predicted that the 
harmonized sales tax will push up new house prices by 5.5 per cent 
and will force municipalities to raise the property taxes. The 
Canadian Real Estate Association says that harmonization will 
increase the cost of a new house by $4,000 in Nova Scotia and 
Newfoundland and by $3,374 in New Brunswick.
<P>
	GST harmonization is responsible for the closure of five 
Greenberg stores and the loss of jobs. I thought the issue of jobs 
was really important to this government. The management of this 
store has said that there is a 50-50 chance of further store closures 
and the loss of more jobs.
<P>
	I am really surprised that the backbenchers from the Atlantic 
provinces are not in an outrage over losing jobs and raising more 
taxes. There must be a lot more here than what they are mentioning 
to the people of Canada including the taxpayers across the Atlantic 
provinces.
<P>
	Consumers will pay more for funeral services, children's 
clothing, books, auto repairs, electricity, gasoline, home fuel 
heating, haircuts and a whole bunch of things. They will be paying 
more for these things and many of these families can barely get by 
now.
<P>
	I am really confused that members from the Atlantic provinces 
are willing to accept this job killing situation. That is what is 
happening. It is killing jobs. Those who are making these 
statements are high-fluential people.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> High-fluential, high-fluential, whoa.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> They have some knowledge about what is 
going on. They are on real estate boards and councils.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> High-fluential.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> The best thing the member for Halifax can do is 
yap off at the mouth. She is sitting there heckling somebody else 
and she does not know what she is talking about. I will direct my 
questions to the other member who spoke eloquently, and I thank 
him for that.
<P>
	These are highly influential people who are making these 
comments. I am not the one who is making them but people who 
have the knowledge of what is going on are. I would like the 
member to respond.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7054"> 7054 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murphy:</B> Mr. Speaker, the technology for the changeover 
is already in place. There will be some changes but the technology 
is in place and it is not the same as introducing a whole new 
system.
<P>
	The member talks about the prices of houses going up. I just 
indicated in my speech that housing prices will go down because 
the input costs will go back into the industry and they will bring the 
prices down.
<P>
	The member mentioned that jobs are being lost. One of the major 
features of this tax is that over the long term, over the next few 
years, jobs will be created. There will be all kinds of input taxes 
being returned to the different companies in Atlantic Canada and in 
Nova Scotia in particular. They will have more money to work 
with. Consequently, they will be able to put that money back into 
improving and expanding their businesses and obviously creating 
jobs.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	About 73 per cent of Nova Scotians who were surveyed prior to 
this system coming into place wanted a system which provided one 
price which included the tax in it. Businesses asked for it. That is 
why we made these agreements with the Atlantic provinces, with 
the exception of P.E.I. We wanted to create a better situation for the 
consumers, namely that they would be able to go to the cash 
register with a $15.95 price tag and pay $15.95.
<P>
	I am sorry that the member opposite has been misled. 
Unfortunately, his comments the way he put them are incorrect.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The hon. member for 
Halifax on debate.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Halifax, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, before I begin 
my remarks in this debate, may I say that I am delighted to be 
speaking here today, the first time since you took up your new 
duties as assistant deputy chairman. May I congratulate you on that 
appointment, a most worthy appointment. I am delighted to be here 
but having said that, I am afraid that I am less delighted about 
several things.
<P>
	First, I would like to extend my compliments to the hon. member 
for Wild Rose. I would let him know that the name of Canada's 
10th province is Newfoundland, like ``understand''. If you are 
going to understand a province, you should also know how it is 
pronounced.
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary Centre spoke quite eloquently, if 
somewhat off the point, a little earlier. I would like to say a few 
things to him too. I have great respect for that hon. member. I know 
that his belief in public service and in doing things for Canadians is 
very strong and I take no exception to that.
<P>
	However, I will say as a Nova Scotian to the hon. member who 
comes from Alberta that I do not think Nova Scotia members 
lectured Albertans or westerners when the grain farmers took a 
$1.6 billion subsidy from the federal government. They did not say 
that it was not good for them. On behalf of the members of the 
three Atlantic provinces who are accepting this deal and who think 
this is a good deal, I would just say: Keep your lectures at home. 
We think we know a little bit better what is good for Nova Scotia, 
what is good for Newfoundland and what is good for New 
Brunswick.
<P>
	Does the hon. member really think that premiers such as Brian 
Tobin, John Savage and Frank McKenna get together and say: ``Let 
us do something bad for our provinces''? With the greatest of 
respect to the hon. member, does he really think that people who 
have barely gotten their feet wet in the salt water of the Atlantic 
Ocean know better than these people who have led their provinces 
in good times and in bad? Does the member really think that he 
knows better what to do for Nova Scotians, New Brunswickers and 
Newfoundlanders than Frank McKenna, John Savage and Brian 
Tobin? I do not think so.
<P>
	With the greatest of respect to members of the third party and 
possibly others in the official opposition who might oppose this 
excellent plan for Atlantic Canadians, may I say that in that region 
they are not even on the radar screen politically and there is a 
reason for that. They do not comprehend what is good for Nova 
Scotians. Not even being able to pronounce the name of one of the 
provinces is a good reason they are not on the radar screen.
<P>
	Having dealt with that, let me now deal with why the harmonized 
sales tax is a good thing for the people of Nova Scotia and her sister 
provinces.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	Let me quote a premier I was talking about just a few minutes 
ago, the hon. Frank McKenna, one of the most successful premiers 
in Canadian history, I might add. Frank McKenna said on Sunday: 
``This is a chance for Atlantic Canada to enjoy the single biggest 
advantage we have ever had in the last 50 years against the rest of 
the country. We are now the most competitive area in all of North 
America for doing business''. That comes from Premier McKenna 
and from the Atlantic Provinces Economic Council, a most 
respected organization in our region.
<P>
	The GST has sucked an additional $3 billion out of our region, a 
bigger increase in federal sales tax payments than in any other part 
of Canada, so it is no wonder the three provinces opted for the new 
tax to replace it, along with the $1 billion in transition funding. It is 
only appropriate that the region that took it, Atlantic Canada, was 
the one that was losing the most with the GST.
<P>
	What is going to happen with this transitional funding? The 
transitional funding will be used in part by the provinces accepting 
this to assist those small numbers of consumers who are going to be 
hurt somewhat by the  broader base of the tax, those few things that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7055"> 7055 </A></B>
<P>
will go up in price. Will some things go up in price? Yes, some will. 
The transitional funding will in part be used to assist those people.
<P>
	I might also add there is no loss in the low income rebate of the 
GST that was instituted when the GST came in. It will continue to 
be paid to those people who qualify in the three Atlantic provinces.
<P>
	The three Atlantic provinces as of April 1997 will have a 
simpler, less costly and more effective sales tax system, and that is 
the bottom line. Clearly members from Alberta have so little 
knowledge about what is important in Atlantic Canada that his has 
not managed to penetrate. I am not sure what does manage to 
penetrate, but then that is another story.
<P>
	The BST will be the crowning in touch in turning Atlantic 
Canada into the most attractive business location in all of North 
America. From the days of wooden ships and iron persons until 
today this is something that has been long overdue in Nova Scotia, 
in New Brunswick and in Newfoundland.
<P>
	I really do think that when members opposite think they can 
lecture us on what is good for the Atlantic region they should at 
least be able to say they know something about the region that they 
are attempting to lecture. We do not take kindly to lectures down 
there. We know what is good for us and the harmonized sales tax is 
very good for us.
<P>
	Consumers will know what the price is before they go to the cash 
register. How many times has every one of us in this House and the 
people we represent seen an item that we wanted to buy, taken it to 
the cash register and by the time it was all added up, whammo, we 
were paying considerably more than we thought we were going to? 
Those days are over in Nova Scotia. That will be finished come 
April 1.
<P>
	Consumers will have lower tax rates and on many goods will pay 
lower prices. This message has to be repeated and repeated because 
when it comes to misleading, and I know the hon. member opposite 
does not really wish to mislead, or at least I assume he does not 
wish to mislead, over and over again scare tactics have been used 
with regard to this plan on the consumers of my province and the 
two neighbouring provinces, trying to suggest that people will be 
paying considerably more when the truth is they will be paying 
less.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> You don't know what the truth is.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> That snappy comeback from the member for Wild 
Rose has just made me want to sit down and burst into tears but I 
will try to control myself.
<P>
	Businesses will have to deal with only one tax. From the first day 
that the GST was mentioned in this House, when you and I, Mr. 
Speaker, were rookie MPs in opposition, I have heard from small 
business people in  Nova Scotia how they needed the simplification 
of the tax system and, again, this is what this is doing.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	I will tell a little story about someone I deal with a lot in Halifax. 
His name is Bob Richards, a cab driver. He is probably the best cab 
driver in Nova Scotia. This is not to take away from other cab 
drivers there, but Bob has been driving me to and from the airport 
since I was elected. Through storm or sleet or dark of night, if I can 
steal a line from the American post office, he is there. He has a 
number of clients who know how good and reliable he is and 
consequently he has a good limousine business in Halifax.
<P>
	Bob has complained bitterly about the kind of red tape and the 
bureaucratic detail he as a businessman has been hamstrung by in 
this tax. This tax is going to be a lot less cumbersome to business 
people like Bob Richards in the three Atlantic provinces that have 
taken this deal. That is a good thing. This is something Nova 
Scotians care about. Am I out of time, Mr. Speaker?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I hope so.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> I have one minute. The member for Wild Rose 
hopes I am out of time. I can only tell the hon. member that I will 
be here making my point long after he too has joined the pantheon 
of Reformers leaving this House.
<P>
	In closing let me say something about books because I have to 
correct what the hon. member for Wild Rose said. Books will not 
be more expensive in the province of Nova Scotia. Indeed some 
books purchased by public libraries, schools, universities, public 
colleges, municipalities, qualifying charities and non-profit 
organizations, most particularly those dealing with the literacy 
problem, will receive a 100 per cent GST rebate. That comes about 
because the Minister of Finance listened to the Liberal backbench 
that went to him and told him how important it was to have this 
movement and this rebate on the GST on books.
<P>
	We in the backbench of the Liberal Party are proud of what we 
did. We are proud of the HST. It is good for Nova Scotia, New 
Brunswick and Newfoundland. I am delighted to have had the 
opportunity to say so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank the member for Halifax for her intervention on this 
issue. I am glad to hear somebody from Nova Scotia get up and talk 
about it and defend it, defend it to the degree and with the passion 
that she has.
<P>
	Let me clarify a few things she said in her comments. In no way 
during my speech was I trying to lecture to Nova Scotians and to 
tell them what was right for them or what was better for them. In no 
way was I giving a lecture. I was criticizing the method with which 
this government is implementing a harmonized sales tax. I was 
criticizing the government in its implementation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7056"> 7056 </A></B>
<P>
	It is not a question of knowing better. I am not saying I know 
any better. I am here to give some suggestions and some ideas 
and that is all I have been trying to do. Doing what is right is 
important. In the Standing Committee on Finance when we looked 
at replacements for the GST there were a lot of alternatives looked 
at. The Liberal government had a lot of options and a lot of 
choices. It hung its hat on replacing the GST with a harmonized 
sales tax but it did it piecemeal. It is doing it ad hoc. It is doing 
it at a high cost.
<P>
	Let me point out to the hon. member where the high cost is. First 
of all, to reduce the combined current rate in those three provinces 
of 19 per cent down to 15 per cent. Obviously it is a loss of revenue 
to them. Call it a transfer payment. Let us not get into partisan 
politics for a minute. Let us call it a transition cost from one regime 
to another of $1 billion. That is $1 billion of expense that need not 
happen if they would have taken the full report and looked at the 
Reform recommendations in the minority report.
<P>
	Reform said it would not solve the problems because this is just 
entrenching the GST. The Liberal Party wants to replace the GST. 
In other words, get a system of taxation that is revenue neutral that 
is not this confusing, complicated, bureaucratic, red tape system of 
taxation.
<P>
	Reform said if it were going to do it and look at it, look at an 
integrated system with those provinces that have provincial sales 
tax. Given that it wanted to look at it, here are some 
recommendations Reform has. Make it integrated. Make it the 
broadest possible base, the widest base. Let us tax everything, 
groceries, prescription drugs. Tax everything. That way there 
would be the lowest rate and we would not have this billion dollar 
cost to make up for lost revenues in certain provinces.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	Second, for those low income people who are affected, we 
currently have a system of rebate and this national integrated sales 
tax could then adjust to the fact that certain people who are the 
lower income level would get a bigger rebate than they currently 
get and we have taken care of those in society we have an 
obligation to take care of.
<P>
	These were legitimate recommendations. The reason I am so 
vehemently opposed to the current botched up mess the 
government has is that it is not doing it right. It is being done 
wrong. It is not getting all the provinces to agree. The Liberals 
quote Mike Harris of Ontario. Mike Harris would love to 
co-operate if everybody else across the country were coming into 
the deal at the same time, on a level playing field. Okay, so we 
would have to compensate, but the finance minister did not do that.
<P>
	I just want to clarify for the member for Halifax and give her 
enough time to respond that it was never my intention to lecture. It 
was never my intention to stand here and say that I know better. If 
the Liberals would just  read that full minority report, we did make 
some recommendations which the government has not listened to. 
It is being done piecemeal and that is not right. Let us do it right.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I accept the hon. member's comments 
that he was not lecturing. However, I do not accept some of the 
things he said. Let me just make a few points in the very short time 
I have.
<P>
	First, hanging our hat on a specific program is what government 
is about. In government we do not have the luxury to gadfly around 
a pick one policy one day and another policy the next. We pick a 
policy that we feel is good for our constituents and we go with it. 
That is what has happened here.
<P>
	Again, the premiers of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and 
Newfoundland realized this was a good policy and they decided to 
go with. If other provinces have not picked up on it, I can only say 
that they do not understand the situation as fully as they should.
<P>
	With regard to what the hon. member said about increasing the 
GST rebate to the individuals, I think that betrays to some extent 
two things. First, that the hon. member does not quite understand 
what the transitional funding is. But more particularly, it betrays 
the fact that there are chasmic differences between the Reform 
Party and the Liberal Party because in the Liberal Party we do not 
necessarily think that the best way to deal with funding to assist a 
province is to put it directly in the hands of the consumer in all 
ways. There may be moneys that are better administered through 
the provincial government. In this case, this is what we have done 
and what we support.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have just 
listened to two members from across the way who have told us 
about all sorts of things that do not, or will not, exist with respect to 
this bill.
<P>
	I will naturally take a moment to try to place the effects of Bill 
C-70 in perspective. Everything we have heard during the last two 
speeches has been nonsense. Things must therefore be put in 
perspective.
<P>
	First of all, Bill C-70 is a collection of amendments that are 
going to complicate even further what Canadians had to contend 
with in the previous legislation. Just now, they were trying to tell us 
that this would make it easier for businesses to collect the GST, but 
this is not so.
<P>
	Bill C-70, introduced by the Minister of Finance, is a striking 
example of what this government can do to make a mockery of 
democracy.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	First, there is the manner in which this voluminous bill was 
tabled, without allowing time for the official opposition to examine 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7057"> 7057 </A></B>
<P>
its contents. The official  opposition had less than 24 hours to read 
and examine the complete bill. That is a mockery of democracy.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance would do well to change his ways, for 
the benefit of Canadians. A bill as technical as this, with so many 
amendments, deserves to be examined in greater detail.
<P>
	This is not the first example of the contempt in which democracy 
is held by members across the way, nor, I am sure, is it the last we 
shall see before the coming election. They will be trying to pull 
some fast ones on Canadians.
<P>
	This bill is proof of the failure to keep the election promises 
made in the famous red book by the Prime Minister himself, by the 
Minister of Finance, by the Liberal government, which has 
forgotten, without a shadow of a doubt, that it is governing on 
behalf of the public.
<P>
	How many times did they promise during the 1993 election 
campaign to scrap the GST outright? The present Prime Minister 
said that he was going to scrap it. In 1994, he also said that the 
Liberals, i.e. his own government, detested this tax and that they 
were going to get rid of it.
<P>
	Today, with the tabling of this bill, we have come to the moment 
of truth. The worst part of all this, however, is that the Liberals 
used the taxpayers' money, yes the taxpayers' money, to pay for a 
byelection on this matter. The Deputy Prime Minister treated us to 
an appalling demonstration of how not to keep one's promise. Yet 
making the GST disappear was an election promise.
<P>
	The only disappearance in this bill is that the GST has been made 
to disappear from view, has been camouflaged. It will be 
camouflaged, it will be hidden from view. The government ought 
to know that the people are not fools. The public knows very well 
that this government does not keep its promises.
<P>
	In Quebec we have a motto, one which the people of Quebec will 
put into application when the time is ripe. That motto is ``Je me 
souviens'', and yes, we will remember. I shall speak shortly on 
what Quebec has done to harmonize its sales tax.
<P>
	This brings us to Bill C-70, where the Liberals end up doing 
exactly what they themselves have criticized. The new GST is a 
hypocritical tax, and that makes a lot of people's hair stand on end. 
It is a hypocritical tax, that is true. From now on, it will be hidden 
within the cost of goods and services.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	However, in a report of the Standing Committee on Finance 
which dates back, not to 1990 but to 1994, the Liberal majority, 
these people sitting in front of us, took a position that was clear and 
to the point on what the GST should be. They said in the report that 
it would be improper to hide from Canadians the amounts they paid 
in taxes to their governments and that making it a hidden  tax 
undermined their ability to make the government accountable for 
the way these taxes were collected and, to a lesser extent, for the 
way moneys were spent. This is straight from the report of the 
Standing Committee on Finance. I repeat, the date is very 
important. This was in 1994.
<P>
	What happened since that time? Today, we are hearing a very 
different message. I think the Liberals, the members of this 
government, are suffering from amnesia. What does this mean? It 
means saying one thing today and saying the opposite tomorrow.
<P>
	Personally, this is an attitude I could not tolerate. We cannot 
change our minds overnight, just like that, especially when 
everything we buy nowadays costs Canadians an awful lot of 
money. Has power made members opposite deaf? Being in power 
means being hard of hearing, speechless and asleep. That is what is 
happening now.
<P>
	Here is another example of the amnesia of members opposite. In 
1989, they were in opposition. The position of the Liberals on 
hiding the GST in the sales price was that if the GST was hidden in 
the sales price, it would be much easier for the government to 
increase it later on. That is what they were saying in 1989. Today, 
they dismiss this out of hand. They have reversed their position. So 
they say one thing when they are in opposition and something else 
entirely when they are in power.
<P>
	Is that what Bill C-70 is all about? Is the Liberal government 
proposing to hide the tax to make it easier to increase later on? 
Later on meaning a few months from now, after the election, for 
instance? Considering the selective memory of members of the 
current government, we have every right to ask these questions. 
And there is one I would like to ask especially: What can the public 
expect now? The Liberals, the people opposite, talked about doing 
away with the GST, but now they want to hide it. Can we expect 
any increases in the GST in the months to come?
<P>
	We also know that 76 per cent of Canadian businesses are against 
hiding the GST in the price of goods and services, although the 
opposite was implied just now. Personally, when I pay my bills, I 
want to know where my money is going. I want to know the price 
of the product or service. I also want to know how much I will be 
sending the government and what it will do with it. I want the 
government to be accountable. I am sure that my constituents agree 
with me. Some members would do well to return to their riding and 
talk to those who elected them to see whether they approve of this 
bill.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	Rest assured of one thing. I am going back to my riding to talk to 
the people. Every time I have the opportunity, I tell them that the 
government reneges on its promises, that the GST will be hidden 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7058"> 7058 </A></B>
<P>
and that this government can do what it likes with it. It can do with 
it what it likes.
<P>
	I would also like to look at another aspect of this bill, the most 
undemocratic element and one that, yet again, tramples the rights 
of Quebecers. We heard endlessly during the referendum 
campaign, and even afterward, that all Canadians were equal. This 
bill provides a fine lesson in equality. Just a fine lesson.
<P>
	Quebecers are denied the compensation paid the maritime 
provinces. Is this the government's idea of equality among 
Canadians? Is this what it is? One law for the maritimes, one for 
Quebec. The Minister of Finance's election promise costs $1 
billion. On top of it, they are calling this harmonization. I find this 
very confusing.
<P>
	Naturally, someone is going to have to come up with this $1 
billion. Although Quebec harmonized the sales tax with the federal 
government, it is going to have to pay $250 million. All the other 
Canadians are going to have to make up the difference. Is it in the 
public's interest to have double standards in government policies? I 
think not.
<P>
	When will the Minister of Finance inform us of the criteria 
applying to his compensation package? This is very important. 
When will the Minister of Finance show us that Quebec is not 
entitled to this compensation? There must be a debate on this 
question. Quebecers are entitled to this debate, because they will be 
footing the bill.
<P>
	I am telling you nothing new when I say that Quebec harmonized 
its tax with that of the federal government. Quebec administers the 
tax. Quebec acted very responsibly. Why then are Quebecers not 
entitled to the compensation the federal government is giving to the 
maritime provinces? I am wondering. The people opposite are 
hiding behind power.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	Some day, the government will need to come up with an answer, 
in terms of equality and not of campaign promises. We have proof 
that this government's campaign promises are not being kept. They 
did not keep their promise with this bill, where harmonization of 
taxes was concerned, just as they did not keep their main promise 
regarding job creation.
<P>
	It is all very fine to pitch all sorts of figures at us, but when 
everything is weighed out, it can be seen that job creation in this 
country is stalled.
<P>
	If the maritime provinces have additional costs to pay in 
harmonizing their sales tax with the federal one, so does Quebec. If 
the maritimes are entitled to compensation, to the tune of $1 
billion, then Quebec too is entitled to compensation. Once again, 
the Minister of Finance must show some fairness. Good for the  
maritimes and their co-operation with the federal government, but 
what about the other provinces?
<P>
	The maritimes represent 15 per cent of the Canadian population. 
We cannot, therefore, say that harmonization is in place from sea to 
sea. The Minister of Finance is proposing a single tax to be 
administered by a national revenue commission. This commission 
would, for want of a better word, simply squeeze out the provinces. 
Once again, and every time a bill is tabled here, provincial rights 
are getting it in the neck. Here again, provincial autonomy is at 
stake. As we well know, the people on the other side do not give a 
hoot about provincial autonomy.
<P>
	Since I have only a minute left, I would like to talk about the 
famous tax on books. People will remember the Bloc Quebecois 
debate here on the book tax. In Quebec, there is no provincial tax 
on books, whether they are bought by students, self-employed 
workers or anyone else. The sales tax does not apply to books in 
Quebec, but here, with this bill, sales tax will apply. There are, 
however, exceptions for certain institutions.
<P>
	It is not true that the tax is 100 per cent abolished. Only clearly 
designated institutions, such as municipalities and libraries, will be 
entitled to deduct this tax. Canadians must not be taken for people 
who will swallow just anything. They will not. This bill does not 
eliminate the sales tax on books; only certain institutions will be 
exempted. In my opinion, the mere fact of taxing books promotes 
ignorance.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-70. I will be sharing 
my time. I will speak for about 10 minutes. I will begin with a brief 
summary of the new harmonized sales tax proposal.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	Detailed agreements have been reached with three Atlantic 
provinces to implement the new tax, effective April 1, 1997. The 
agreements will include the replacement of the current federal GST 
and the provincial sales tax systems with a single, combined value 
added tax called the harmonized sales tax. There will be a 
substantial reduction in the current combined rates in these 
provinces, which are presently at 17 per cent, 18 per cent and 19 
per cent. The rate will decrease to 15 per cent in the three 
provinces. There will be a single administration of both federal and 
provincial sales taxes. The national treatment of interprovincial 
sales will ensure a level playing field for participating provinces.
<P>
	This is good news for consumers and businesses in these 
provinces. The new tax system will be simpler, more efficient and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7059"> 7059 </A></B>
<P>
more equitable. It is a practical example of how the federal and 
provincial governments can work together.
<P>
	There will also be major benefits for consumers. With tax 
inclusive pricing the consumer will know the full price of their 
purchases before they get to the cash register. At the same time, 
they will know from their receipt how much tax they are paying. Of 
course the new sales tax rate will be substantially lower than the 
current rate in those provinces.
<P>
	The harmonized sales tax will be simple and straightforward for 
business as well. Business will have to deal with only one tax, not 
two; one set of forms, not two; and one tax administration, not two.
<P>
	The previous speaker spent a lot of time talking about some 
issues. I want to deal with those issues. I was hoping to talk more 
about the simplicity of the system, but if there is one system, versus 
two, the efficiencies are evident.
<P>
	The member spoke at some length about a cover-up and a hidden 
tax. Today I had the opportunity to tape a cable show for my 
constituency and I spoke to one of the people at Rogers cable about 
Bill C-70. I asked her how she felt about it. The young lady said to 
me: ``What I really do not like is when I see the price on the 
product and I go to the cash register and I have to pay a different 
price''. That is very indicative of the big problem with the current 
GST system. The price on the shelf is not the price consumers pay 
at the cash register. Consumers are having difficulty making their 
purchase decisions because they have to do some mathematics.
<P>
	By way of history, members should be reminded that the GST 
was not a brand new tax which somehow created these enormous 
revenues for the Government of Canada to pay for services and 
programs. It was a replacement tax for the former manufacturers 
sales tax, which was a hidden tax. It was never seen at the 
consumer level. It was applied at the manufacturing and production 
level. It was included at a rate of some 12.5 per cent or 13 per cent. 
It changed many times. I believe it started at 9 per cent and actually 
got up to about 13.5 per cent.
<P>
	That price was carried through. It was a very unfair tax. It did not 
share the burden equitably and it was very unfair to the 
manufacturing and processing sector. That tax generated some $18 
billion.
<P>
	We know that the former government, the Mulroney 
government, brought in the GST to replace the FST. The current 
GST, when it was brought it, was actually generating less revenue 
for the government than the former FST. We have to think about 
that for a moment. If the GST was generating less revenue for the 
government than the former FST, that means, effectively, that 
consumers under the GST are paying less tax than they formerly 
were. However, they never saw it because the FST was a hidden 
tax.
<P>
	I had an opportunity to participate in the finance hearings. We 
heard from 500 witnesses. We received over 700 reports and 
submissions. We listened carefully to the numerous alternatives 
people were coming forward with.
<P>
	The finance committee reported to this place. It reported to the 
finance minister about some of the options. When the members of 
the committee came back with it they said: ``We cannot find a 
better alternative and it is better not to change it just for the sake of 
change, so let us work with this the best we can''.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	I remember writing a little piece for my constituents in which I 
stated that on balance the proposed harmonized sales tax was not 
ideal but it was the best possible under the circumstances. The 
Mulroney government was unable to harmonize the federal and 
provincial sales taxes and opted for a complex GST applied to a 
base with numerous exceptions. It created a nightmare for 
business, angered consumers and generated less revenue than its 
predecessor tax.
<P>
	I think most Canadians are clear why the GST has the problems 
it does. It was in fact in your face taxation. I do not think Canadians 
are opposed to paying taxes to ensure that Canadian programs that 
we are provided with are properly funded such as health care, 
seniors care and a whole host of things.
<P>
	However, to assist the ordinary Canadian, one of the 
recommendations that came back from all these cross-Canada 
consultations was that the price on the shelf should be the price that 
one pays at the cash register so that the purchase decision was not 
fogged up by what taxes were going to be added. We knew exactly 
what we were going to pay. We also said that we do not want to hide 
the tax from the consumers, unlike what the prior speaker said, that 
we are hiding the tax. No, it is tax included pricing but it clearly 
states on the invoice that the consumer will see the amount of taxes 
included therein.
<P>
	I believe it is very important that the consumer have the 
information and it is also necessary for accounting purposes. I 
think the member was a little intellectually dishonest in presenting 
a so-called cover-up.
<P>
	The previous speaker also talked about poor Quebec. He also 
admitted that in 1991 Quebec did harmonize its federal and 
provincial sales taxes. However, he did not explain why. The 
reason Quebec did this is that harmonization leads to a better 
situation for Quebec businesses. I praise Quebec for having the 
wisdom to harmonize the tax. Now there is an input tax credit on 
the provincial component included in the combined tax. It means 
there is a lower selling price that has been passed on to the 
consumers. On top of that, it means it has a competitive advantage 
over Ontario which has not harmonized. It also has a competitive 
advantage in the export marketplace.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7060"> 7060 </A></B>
<P>
	The member well knows that although Canada as a whole has 
had wonderful performance in terms of the export markets, the 
critical issue is that Quebec has had better than average 
performance in Canada simply because of the harmonization of 
the tax. On that basis alone, Quebec should say ``we don't want 
you to know about this because it is such an important adjunct 
to the economy of Quebec''. It is helping Quebec businesses not 
only in interprovincial trade but in the export business.
<P>
	The question came up about this cost to the three maritime 
provinces. I had to think about this one a bit. The previous speaker 
somehow brought up a billion dollars. I considered that there were 
no other provinces in this country that have a provincial sales tax 
rate as high as they have in the three maritime provinces. We are 
talking about a 12 per cent provincial sales tax. In my province of 
Ontario it is only 8 per cent.
<P>
	What do the members think that does to the ability of the 
consumers to purchase? Their purchasing power has been totally 
crushed by the burden of the provincial taxes.
<P>
	The members will also know that the harmonization of the tax at 
a consistent rate facilitates interprovincial trade and makes the 
whole situation a good foundation to work with Quebec and 
Alberta, which has not sales tax, and I am sure Ontario.
<P>
	I have no hesitation in supporting Bill C-70. This is a move in 
the right direction to make our tax system simpler, easier to 
administer and fairer for consumers and businesses.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Order, please. Before I 
proceed with questions and comments, it is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the question to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows: the hon. 
member for Moncton-Forestry.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
listened carefully to the remarks of our colleague across the way. I 
understood what he was trying to do. Unable to explain the 
difference between what the red book said and the government's 
record on the GST, he went into a defence of simplification and 
harmonization.
<P>
	There is not a member in the House who has questioned the 
importance of harmonizing and simplifying taxes to make things 
easier for business. Our colleague across the way is not 
contributing to our understanding, because this is not what the 
debate is about. The Liberals are dragging it in that direction to 
avoid the real questions that should be asked, which the member 
for Chicoutimi brought out earlier.
<P>
	In the red book, they said: ``We hate this tax and we will scrap 
it''. Now, instead of scrapping it, they are  harmonizing it. This
<P>
way, things are so much nicer, it is less painful, and it brings in 
more money. They also said: ``It should not be hidden''. Now they 
are saying: ``Magicians that we are, we have pulled it out of thin 
air, we have made it vanish, and now we are going to make it 
invisible''.
<P>
	But if simplification and harmonization are as wonderful as all 
that, why did the Atlantic provinces need to be paid $1 billion to go 
for the deal? The aim was to hide the tax in the price of food, 
medicine and books for educational purposes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very important for the member and 
for Canadians watching to hear again from page 22 of the red book. 
Notwithstanding what the member has said, this is what the red 
book did say and what I ran on in the last election. It said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the first session of a new Parliament, a Liberal government will give the 
all-party Finance Committee of the House of Commons a 12-month mandate to 
consult fully with Canadians and provincial governments and to report on ways to 
achieve tax fairness, simplicity, and harmonization. In particular the committee will 
be mandated to report on all options for alternatives to the current GST. A Liberal 
government will replace the GST with a system that generates equivalent revenues, 
is fairer to consumers and to small business, minimizes disruption to small business, 
and promotes federal-provincial fiscal co-operation and harmonization.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is what was promised and that is exactly what has been 
delivered.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, everyone is well aware of what it says in the red book. As 
I understood it, the question that was put to the hon. member was 
not what the red book said on page whatever it is, but what the 
Liberal candidates were saying during the last election.
<P>
	That is far different than what it says in the red book. They can 
deny that until they are blue in the face. Reality has caught up with 
them. They know quite well what was said by a number of them, 
what was said by their leader about the GST and they certainly 
were not talking about harmonizing. They were talking, as the hon. 
member from the Bloc has said, about getting rid of it. They were 
talking about abolishing it. They were talking about killing the 
GST. That is what they talked about during the election campaign 
and Canadians know that. They will remind these candidates of it I 
am sure in the next election.
<P>
	What I found particularly interesting about the hon. member's 
intervention was his stating that somehow he feels Canadians want 
a hidden tax. When Canadians go to the supermarket or to the 
department store and are looking at a price tag on some item, they 
want that to be the total price. That is what I understand he said in 
his remarks.
<P>
	I have not found those Canadians. I have found that Canadians 
are so incensed with the GST, they want to know how much GST 
they are paying. When they go to the till they want to know that the 
item costs X and there is so much PST and GST attached to it. They 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7061"> 7061 </A></B>
<P>
want to know how much they are contributing to the provincial or 
the federal government.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to reiterate, if possible, if he 
honestly believes that the majority of Canadians want a hidden tax. 
That is not my understanding.
<P>
	I have spoken to a lot of Canadians about this issue. They want to 
know how much tax they are contributing to the two levels of 
government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the things that should be noted is 
that the Reform and the Bloc parties have not said what they would 
do. The role of the opposition is to deliver blows that would 
tenderize a turtle.
<P>
	They continue to hurl things like scrap and abolish. But they 
know very well that $18 billion of revenue to the government 
cannot be thrown away. It goes straight to the deficit. That would 
totally destroy jobs.
<P>
	Focus groups were conducted and Canadians have expressed a 
strong preference to know the full price of goods and services in 
advance of their purchase. That is what is proposed in the 
legislation and that is what will happen. However, they will know 
what tax is included in their purchases. It will be stated clearly on 
the bill of sale they receive at the cash register. That is exactly how 
it will happen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Baker (Gander-Grand Falls, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have just a few words on this. After the excellent speech 
by my hon. colleague, I want to add a few words to what my hon. 
colleague said.
<P>
	When he quoted from the red book from which the Bloc and the 
Reform parties keep quoting, the hon. member quoted exactly 
correct. But he forgot one thing in the middle of his quote. In the 
middle of the paragraph in the red book it says the committee will 
be mandated to report on all options for alternatives to the current 
GST. That committee met and a member of the committee from the 
Reform Party spoke in the House this afternoon.
<P>
	It is interesting what the spokesperson for the Reform Party 
pointed out. He pointed out that the Tories and the Reform 
members of the committee wanted in their recommendations to tax 
food. The Reform Party of Canada, according to their 
spokesperson, according to their report, wanted to tax prescription 
drugs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> The truth now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Yes, I heard that here in the House this afternoon 
from the spokesperson for the Reform Party. Of course the Liberal 
government said: ``Absolutely not. We are not going to do that''. 
So they carried  through with the second portion of what was said in 
the red book.
<P>
	Well, members of the Reform Party and the Bloc stand here 
today, talking about being honest with the Canadian people. It is 
interesting that Thursday last week, my hon friend from Don Valley 
North stood in the Chamber and introduced a bill to put some 
restrictions on the banks. What did the Bloc say? ``Oh, no, we 
cannot do that. Oh, no, we cannot interfere with the banks''. That is 
the Bloc for you. Then the Reform Party say: ``Oh no, you can't do 
that. You can't interfere with the profits of the banks''.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> They are not making enough.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> They are not making enough. Incredible isn't it 
when each one of the banks are reporting profits over $1 billion. 
The CEOs are going to get $1 million in performance bonuses. The 
Reform Party and the Bloc stand in this Chamber as the two 
opposition parties and what do they say? ``Oh no, we can't agree 
with members of the backbench'' even though they are performing 
a function for the people of Canada.
<P>
	Do you know what they are doing, Mr. Speaker? They are 
making the government accountable for the ordinary citizens of 
Canada, something that the official opposition should be doing.
<P>
	What does the Reform Party want to do with the payroll taxes of 
Canada? Would everyone like me to read it out?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Read it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I will read it out. Here is the Reform Party of Canada 
on payroll taxes. What a dandy one this is. On page 45, for all the 
employers and employees in Canada, the Reform Party's budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Now the truth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> The hon. member said ``the truth''. Here is the 
taxpayers' budget.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Order. I know the House 
appreciates the enthusiasm of the hon. member for Gander-Grand 
Falls but he knows also the rules that he must not use 
documentation as a prop. He is certainly entitled to quote from the 
material but he should be careful not to wave it around too much. It 
upsets some members. I appreciate that the hon. member will 
follow the rule.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Absolutely, Mr. Speaker. In other words, I will make 
sure I quote from it but I certainly will not show it so that anybody 
will know what I am quoting from.
<P>
	Here is what the Reform wants to do with payroll taxes. Apart 
from on page 45 ``having a benefit structure requiring two weeks of 
work for one week of benefits'' here is what the Reform says. It 
says that it  wants to ``ensure that savings from reform of UI 
translate into deficit elimination''. The Reform Party recommends 
``the establishment of a permanent reserve fund for UI until the 
budget is balanced. Funds from this reserve would be applied 
against the deficit. After the budget was balanced this fund would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7062"> 7062 </A></B>
<P>
remain to balance revenue and expenditure fluctuations under UI 
throughout the economic cycle''.
<P>
	It goes on to say: ``Any additional savings from the restructuring 
of UI after the deficit has been satisfied'' after this huge fund has 
built up, then Reform says: ``savings will be passed on to 
employees and employers in the form of a reduction''.
<P>
	Imagine using unemployment insurance premiums not only to 
completely retire the deficit, not only to satisfy the debt of this 
country but then to build up an additional fund and somewhere 
down the road they are going to pass along a saving to an employer 
or an employee.
<P>
	A tax is a tax. A tax is a tax is a tax. If it is on the employer, if it 
is on the employee, a tax is a tax is a tax. Basically what we have 
here are the opposition parties in this Chamber who do not like the 
record of this Liberal administration. No-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Order. The hon. member 
for Prince George-Peace River on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
respectfully request that if the hon. member for Gander-Grand 
Falls is going to quote from Reform members that he do it 
accurately.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The hon. member knows 
that is not a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was going to go on to something else 
but the hon. member wants me to quote some more. Let me go back 
to the situation where they want to drive up the payroll taxes in 
Canada, where they want to tax food, where they want to tax 
prescription drugs. We will leave that for a moment and we will go 
to where they are suggesting they want to save money.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	Now there is undoubtedly a way of reducing taxes if you save 
money. How do they propose to save money? The Reform Party of 
Canada matches the Tory Party of Canada. In their policy 
statements, both parties tell the Canadian people how they are 
going to raise some revenues, not just by taxing food and 
prescription drugs but also in all of their policy statements they are 
going to attack medicare.
<P>
	For the record, they are going to say as they do here that 
medicare is not only intolerably expensive, it is undesirable.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That's garbage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Garbage. I am not supposed to show the taxpayers 
budget. There it is.
<P>
	Notice that in their conventions the Tories joined Reformers in 
saying that the Canada pension plan should be privatized so that 
people can put money in the bank and then draw their own interest 
from it. They could have their own plans, as the Government of 
Canada could afford neither the Canada pension plan nor medicare.
<P>
	With a record like that, of increasing payroll taxes, of demanding 
a tax on food and prescription drugs, of doing away with medicare 
and the Canada pension plan, is it any wonder that the Tories were 
wiped out and the Reform Party is headed toward a disaster in this 
next election along with the Bloc?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, 
I will try to comment and ask a few questions, but perhaps not with 
the same enthusiasm as the hon. member who just spoke.
<P>
	This reminds me that the same member was just as eager when 
the Conservatives adopted the GST here in the House of Commons, 
but he was eager to vote against the GST. He devoted the same 
energy to preparing the Liberal government's red book which was 
supposed to abolish the GST.
<P>
	The hon. member accuses the Bloc Quebecois of being less than 
honest. On the contrary, we only want to ask the Liberal Party to 
abide by its promises, to be transparent about what was said in the 
red book. You know as well as I do that the Liberals did a lot of 
wailing and hand wringing here in this House. They voted against 
the GST, which was proposed by the Conservatives and passed by 
the House under the Conservative government.
<P>
	Those same Liberals formed a committee, the finance 
committee, on which I sat for one year. The finance committee is 
chaired by a Liberal member, the hon. member for Willowdale. For 
a number of months, I would say for almost a year, the Liberal 
government led Canadian citizens from Quebec to Vancouver to 
believe that there was a possibility the government would abolish 
the GST.
<P>
	Of course the government wanted to abolish the GST to bring 
back the old tax, the hidden tax on goods and services. Today's 
notion of putting a tax on drugs, health care, food and books-the 
Minister of Finance will legislate a tax on books-did not come 
from the Reform Party. It came directly from the Liberal Party.
<P>
	I sat on the finance committee for one year, and the chairman 
asked witnesses whether they would accept a tax that was hidden in 
the price of a product. It is a vicious circle. It is not very honest to 
give witnesses the impression it would cost less. The aim was to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7063"> 7063 </A></B>
<P>
hide the tax in the price of food, medicine and books for 
educational purposes.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	Naturally, the idea does not originate with the Reform Party or 
the Bloc Quebecois. I have to say before this House that the idea 
comes from the Liberal Party. Of course, in view of its 
unpopularity, the Liberal Party backed off. The proof that the 
Liberal Party failed to meet its obligations, that it was not 
transparent in what it said in the red book is that the Deputy Prime 
Minister was forced to resign, because she had made a commitment 
to abolish the GST within the first year of her mandate. She then 
spent government money getting re-elected.
<P>
	Today, the member's knickers are in a twist and he wants us to 
believe that the Liberal Party is the great defender of the GST, 
when it never had the option of withdrawing.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Order, please. The period 
for questions and comments lasts five minutes. As there is only one 
minute left, the hon. member for Gander-Grand Falls can 
respond.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Mr. Speaker, Bloc members in this Chamber are on 
the record of being in favour of the banks' never being restricted. 
As members of the finance committee they fell over backwards, 
tripped over themselves, bent over backwards and said come on 
with some more tax cuts for the wealthiest people in this country as 
proposed by the Senate. The hon. member was at the finance 
committee. On the bifurcation of trademarks, imagine a 50 per cent 
reduction to American companies doing business in Canada. Why 
did Bloc members put forward that position? I will refresh their 
memories. They said ``you know, we have a great many people who 
are interested and we are in favour of anything that involves tax 
reductions for the biggest corporations in this country as long as 
they are from the United States''.
<P>
	There were three separate tax measures in Bill S-9 and this hon. 
member stood up in this Chamber and said ``come on, let's have 
some more tax breaks for the biggest corporations in this country''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The period for questions 
and comments having expired, we now resume debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Asselin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.
<P>
	It is entirely dishonest on the part of the member, who knew he 
would be the last to speak, to invent and say just anything in this 
House.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The hon. member knows 
he is simply prolonging the debate, which is not permitted as a 
point of order. Resuming debate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
understand I have about 10 minutes.
<P>
	I would like to make sure that everybody understands that the 
member from Gander-Grand Falls twice earlier today said he was 
not speaking. About 15 minutes ago he also told me he was not 
going to speak to this issue, but he did. I guess that goes to show 
how much we can trust what he says. He does not tell a lot of the 
truth and he certainly missed out on a lot of it in his speech.
<P>
	I would also like to point out that on some of the points that were 
brought forth earlier today by me, there were some questions as to 
how come I would be making such statements. I note that some of 
these comments that were made earlier are based on the Retail 
Council of Canada, a study from Ernst &amp; Young which I understand 
was put to work by this government. It estimated that a mid-size 
national chain with 50 stores in the Atlantic provinces would pay 
up to $3 million in one time cost starts and $1 million a year to 
comply with this tax that we are talking about.
<P>
	This information also comes from the Halifax Chamber of 
Commerce, the Canadian Real Estate Association, the Greenberg 
Stores management and company. All of these that are objecting 
strongly to this particular legislation I think are very reputable.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	During the 1993 campaign in the riding of Wild Rose, the words 
scrap, kill, get rid of the GST were stated loud and clear by the 
Liberals. I think that was true all across the land. There might have 
been a couple of ridings that were missed but it was pretty broad.
<P>
	Of course, since the election we have all been asked to memorize 
page 22 from the dead book which is supposed to represent what 
the Liberals meant and not what they said. We have heard all kinds 
of comments regarding their campaign, for example, ``sometimes I 
shoot from the lip'' and ``gee, we made a mistake''. However, that 
does not overlook how the campaign went.
<P>
	Let us look at page 22. One paragraph states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The GST has lengthened and deepened the recession. It is costly for small 
business to administer and very expensive for the government to collect. And the 
GST has fallen far short of its promised revenue potential-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I think they have corrected that revenue potential. The amount of 
extra taxes they are going to grab after this change will make up for 
that loss.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-partly because it has stimulated the underground cash economy-.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7064"> 7064 </A></B>
<P>
	I really wonder if any Liberal member on that side of the House 
could stand up today and say Bill C-70 is really going to address 
the underground cash economy. It will not touch it. In fact, it will 
probably get far worse.
<P>
	The red book goes on to state:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A Liberal government will replace the GST with a system that generates 
equivalent revenues-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It will not be equivalent. It will be quite a bit more.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-is fairer to consumers-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Consumers are not agreeing with that. I understand there is a 
petition with 16,000 names attached to it from consumers in the 
Atlantic provinces who are opposed to this whole idea.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-minimizes disruption to small business, and promotes federal-provincial fiscal 
co-operation and harmonization.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Let us take a look at one statement regarding small business in 
this Liberal dead book: ``It is costly for small business to 
administer and very expensive to collect''. Will this harmonization 
answer this statement? What do businesses say? First, it says this 
new idea will be a nightmare to administer. Three major retailers in 
Atlantic Canada have stated that their net annual retail deficit will 
total $27 million once harmonization is implemented.
<P>
	One private retailer in the Atlantic region was contemplating 
opening two new stores in 1997 but has decided against it as a 
result of the increased costs associated with this harmonization.
<P>
	The Halifax Chamber of Commerce predicts that the 
harmonization will push up new house prices by 5.5 per cent. As 
well, it is going to force municipalities to raise the property taxes.
<P>
	The GST is responsible for the closure of five Greenberg stores 
and the loss of many jobs in five major cities in the Atlantic region. 
They say that if this harmonization comes in they are 
contemplating that there is a 50-50 chance that it is going to close a 
lot more stores because of that. This is what the businesses are 
saying, not what Reform members are saying.
<P>
	When businesses are saying this and we have 16,000 names on a 
petition, I wonder why there is not outrage by these Liberal 
backbenchers from the Atlantic provinces, or does that mean they 
are approving the loss of jobs? I find that strange because there is a 
bit of an integrity problem here. I remember when the Liberals ran 
on the promise of jobs, jobs, jobs. Harmonizing the GST in New 
Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia will kill 
jobs, jobs, jobs. That is what a lot of businesses are claiming. In 
fact, the stores that are closing, those that are contemplating 
closing and the ones that would not open up are killing jobs.
<P>
	If the Liberals want to maintain their integrity which east coast 
MP is going to resign and run in a byelection? Which east coast MP 
will defend their failure to honour  their promise by taking it back 
to the people at a cost of $500,000? Which MP has the integrity? 
Our guess is none.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	The Fraser Institute states that tax burdens on the Canadian 
economy remain the single most significant barrier to economic 
acceleration and job growth, the single most significant barrier. 
The harmonization of the GST will increase the tax burden on the 
people of three Atlantic provinces.
<P>
	In the first nine months of 1996 Statistics Canada stated that 
retail sales increased only 1.4 per cent. Every economist states that 
in order to create jobs domestic retail sales must increase, yet this 
legislation will reduce retail sales in the Atlantic provinces which 
sign the agreement.
<P>
	Statistics Canada shows that retail sales in Newfoundland 
dropped 3.8 per cent. In Nova Scotia they dropped 3.2 per cent and 
in New Brunswick they dropped 1.4 per cent, yet the Liberal 
government wants to further harm retail sales at a time when retail 
sales, according to economists, could create jobs.
<P>
	The one Atlantic province which refused to harmonize, Prince 
Edward Island, is showing an increase in retail sales and a 7.5 per 
cent drop in employment insurance payments. Newfoundland had a 
13.2 per cent increase in employment insurance payments and will 
be hard hit by the increased tax grab. Is the economic growth in 
P.E.I. not telling the Liberals anything about harmonization? Did 
the recent provincial election not tell them anything? Their Liberal 
counterparts, most of whom were anxious to come on board on 
harmonization, went bye-bye. When the election was over, those 
who opposed harmonization were victorious.
<P>
	A Fraser Institute study shows that Canada has the worst tax 
record of any G-7 country. Taxes are a real problem for this country 
and the Liberals are a major problem behind the taxes.
<P>
	How many families must starve, must feel the anguish of 
break-up and disintegration? The Liberals know that economic 
destruction of the family unit causes the greatest injury to families, 
yet they carry on with a policy which will harm families. Even 
families that through good fortune, not Liberal logic, can keep jobs 
will suffer under this legislation.
<P>
	The price of children's clothing will increase during the coldest 
months of the year. The price of electricity and home heating fuel 
will increase. The cost of transportation for workers to get to work 
will increase because the price of gas will increase. Can the 
Liberals not give the taxpayers a break?
<P>
	Property owners in the Atlantic provinces signing on to the 
harmonization plan have all stated that renters will have to pay 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7065"> 7065 </A></B>
<P>
higher rents. Does the Liberal government  enjoy putting mothers, 
fathers and children into the snow because of a broken promise?
<P>
	Increased costs mean that private sector investment in the 
Atlantic provinces signing on to harmonization will be curtailed. 
Why would someone invest when they know that their direct costs 
will increase, when consumers will restrict purchases and when 
there will be less in retail sales?
<P>
	Ernst &amp; Young, the government's accounting firm, stated that 
national chain stores of 50 branches will pay $3 million in set-up 
costs and $1.1 million per year more than stores in provinces 
without harmonization. If you were going to set up a business, 
where would you go?
<P>
	I wish all the people of the Atlantic provinces a Merry Christmas 
this year. Because of harmonization, next year they may have no 
job or no money to enjoy the season.
<P>
	I would like to put out a Pinocchio alert to all Canadians: be 
careful when a Liberal opens his mouth.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> When Bill C-70 is 
considered again the hon. member will have eight minutes 
remaining in his time.
<P>
	It being 5.49 p.m., the House will now proceed to the 
consideration of Private Members' Business, as listed on today's 
Order Paper.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CRIMINALCODE">CRIMINAL CODE</A></H3>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Mississauga East, Lib.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-321, an act to amend the Criminal Code and the Corrections 
and Conditional Release Act (cumulative sentences), be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the 
member for Ontario.
<P>
	For the second time this year I present a bill which offers 
Parliament the opportunity to correct one of our justice system's 
most jagged obscenities. This bill, now called Bill C-321, asks that 
Canada stop giving volume discounts to its rapists and murders 
through concurrent sentencing. My bill is about reasonable and 
required change that every major victims group in the country is 
demanding with the support of most Canadians.
<P>
	Bill C-321 has as its purpose three objectives: to reduce our 
inhumanity to the families of victims, to restore some truth in 
sentencing, and to stop gambling away lives on the chance that a 
multiple murderer or serial predator will not attack again.
<P>
	This debate is about competing interests. It is about the interests 
of the families of victims who need the peace  only time can offer 
to salvage the remnants of their shattered lives. It is about the 
interests of victims who have every reason to fear the release of a 
predator and who can never escape the endless parole process that 
annually threatens to unleash the chained savagery of their 
assailants. These interests compete with the far more lucrative 
interests of the predator protection industry which regards each 
predator as a perpetual revenue generating opportunity.
<P>
	Since I reintroduced this bill I have sadly been visited by too 
many victims of crime who have now come to realize that they are 
also victims of Parliament. Some had lost children, some had lost 
parents, some had lost spouses, but all had lost faith in the courts, 
lost faith in parole boards and, most of all, lost faith in Parliament. 
They all went through trials where the focus of the defence was to 
weaken their resolve, to humiliate them, to wear them down in an 
effort to reduce the number of charges or perhaps provoke a plea 
bargain. Every survivor endured months, even years at the hands of 
our courts only to find that the predator convicted of the murder of 
their child, spouse or parent would serve not a single day in jail for 
that crime. Concurrent sentencing always applies. Judges have no 
flexibility. The lowest price is the law every day.
<P>
	Victims come to court with a naive sense that they will find 
justice there but leave with the reality that their family's tragedy is 
of virtually no consequence in the sentencing equation. They carry 
on their lives in helpless outrage, left to pick up the pieces of their 
dismembered future. But their suffering is far from over. Every 
parole hearing, every 745 hearing will confiscate any peace of 
mind they may have regained. Some victims cannot cope, they 
cannot work, they cannot sleep. The strain tears apart what is left of 
their families.
<P>
	Seventy four per cent of parents of murdered children separate; 
100 per cent of these families have been sentenced to life 
imprisoned by injustice, revictimized by the inhumanity inflicted 
by a justice system driven by billable hours.
<P>
	But some victims do muster courage and draw purpose from 
their personal horror by trying to change the system which treated 
them with such cruelty and disregard. They journey to Ottawa 
thinking that MPs in Parliament will listen and spare future victims 
from the barbed face of Canadian justice. However, they soon 
realize that victims are widely regarded here as a meddlesome 
nuisance to the lucrative business of justice and watch how their 
every effort and initiative is stifled by process or hidden 
opposition.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7066"> 7066 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	Victims know that some members of this House mock them as 
the walking wounded or try to trivialize their efforts by branding 
them as a victims industry. They endure the contempt of those in 
this place who think themselves far too sophisticated, far too 
educated to be  swayed by any tragedy caused by their own 
resistance to change.
<P>
	The casualties of our inaction continue to mount. Earlier this 
summer not one but two multiple murderers were free on parole in 
Mississauga. Concurrent sentencing had given these repeat killers 
volume discounts for their crimes.
<P>
	For John Lyman Kehoe, the second child he murdered did not 
affect his sentence so he was free in time to create yet a third 
victim. On July 2, just five months ago, Kehoe and another paroled 
multiple murderer ambushed a real estate agent, Wendy Carroll, 
slashed her throat and left her for dead. She survived, but no thanks 
to the justice system or the parole board which opened the cages of 
her assailants.
<P>
	Wendy Carroll's life was nearly erased because our sentencing 
system erases victims. Had John Kehoe served a consecutive term 
of parole ineligibility for the second child he murdered, as Bill 
C-321 prescribes, he would not have been free to prey on Wendy 
Carroll or anyone else.
<P>
	Wendy Carroll writes: ``Both of these two animals murdered 
twice before yet only served one 12 year sentence each. This is 
justice? Where is the justice for the two dead children, the two dead 
adults and me? I would like someone to explain to me how 
rehabilitated they both are. I have many scars and permanent 
injuries to show otherwise''.
<P>
	The only answer we have for Wendy Carroll is that she was part 
of the annual sacrifice of victims that is necessary to sustain our 
parole system and all the fees it generates. On average a person a 
month is murdered by a paroled criminal-a person a month. If a 
children's toy had that record it would be banned.
<P>
	The National Parole Board considers its record, its annual 
slaughter, to be a success story. I did not have to do any research to 
find a case where a multiple murderer was paroled early and 
attacked another victim. The place where it happened was a five 
minute drive from my house and it happened just two weeks after I 
resubmitted this bill.
<P>
	The victim cannot understand how two predators who have been 
convicted of killing four people between them could have been set 
free to attack again. Their cages were flung open by volume 
discounts applied to their sentences which disregarded all but the 
first victim and left them eligible for parole in half the time. Their 
parole was not denied for long by the National Parole Board.
<P>
	Why did each of these savages deserve to have his second victim 
reduced to a mention not worthy of an additional sentence? Why 
were these predators considered safe to be placed in our 
communities?
<P>
	I see your signal, Mr. Speaker. I am going past ten minutes. I am 
taking the remaining time.
<P>
	We do not bother with investigations anymore. It is simply a 
matter of routine for dangerous criminals to be released and for 
new victims to be savaged. Bill C-321 does not ask the parole board 
to be any less irresponsible. It does not increase the penalty for any 
crime. What it asks for is penalties that currently apply to each 
murder or rape conviction to be served and not be written off as 
part of the bulk rate for carnage.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	A little truth in sentencing, a small measure of public safety, is 
all that is asked. Perhaps it may also gently reverse the cheapening 
of life that continues in our courts.
<P>
	It is the height of irony this week that we will commemorate the 
slaughter of 14 women by Marc Lépine seven years ago. The irony 
is that if Marc Lépine had not killed himself he would have been 
eligible for parole in perhaps as few as three years from now.
<P>
	Denis Lortie was released in just 11 years for machine-gunning 
three people to death. How much longer would Lépine have served 
and why is it that some MPs who rail against such tragedy also 
support volume discounts for the cause?
<P>
	Wendy Carroll wrote: ``For some reason our politicians have 
decided to grant rights to violent criminals who have taken every 
right away from their victims. What are they thinking? How many 
people must endure the horrific and extremely painful experience I 
did in fighting criminals like these for my life? How many more 
innocent people must die before Parliament decides to make some 
changes?''
<P>
	Perhaps the subcommittee on Private Members' Business holds 
that wisdom or perhaps can issue Wendy Carroll with a medal, with 
a clasp for surviving Parliament's negligence.
<P>
	I suspect no fact can illustrate the need for Bill C-321 better than 
the tragic murders of Arnold and Donna Edwards. They were 
murdered when George Lovie was released immediately after 
assaulting their daughter. Today the family can look forward to 
parole and 745 hearings to start in just 10 years. After that time 
they will have to be constantly on guard in case Lovie is released 
and hunts down the rest of their family. They are in that situation 
for one reason. Lovie got a volume discount, sentenced as if he had 
killed only once and committed no other crimes. Had Bill C-321 
been in place at that time, he would have received at least 50 years 
of parole ineligibility, giving the surviving members of the 
Edwards family the freedom to rebuild their lives without parole 
hearings, without fear.
<P>
	After the trial and the sentence the Edwards family were naive 
enough to think that Parliament would change the system just 
because of a few more casualties. Don Edwards, the son of the 
victims, wrote in a published article: ``Letters by family and 
friends  demanding change to the justice system have been sent to 
three Prime Ministers, cabinet ministers, MPs, MPPs, police, the 
Ontario Complaints Commissioner. Some have responded and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7067"> 7067 </A></B>
<P>
others have not. In follow up letters some MPs could not even spell 
my parents' name correctly. Sad,'' Edwards said.
<P>
	He continues: ``Family and friends now realize politicians and 
their aides have mastered the games of pass the responsibility, 
don't look to me for change, let's talk around the issue and who 
cares, convicted murders I'll protect''.
<P>
	Edwards' effort spawned a 100,000 name petition supporting a 
private member's bill, Bill C-330, presented by the member for 
Hamilton West. Edwards was in the visitor's gallery as one MP 
denied unanimous consent to have that bill made votable. History 
repeats as the tragedies mount. Today another MP is here waiting to 
deny unanimous consent. It is part of the system, part of the 
strategy to forever frustrate every effort for change.
<P>
	Debbie Mahaffy spoke for all victims when she wrote to all of 
us: ``Shame on you all for adding to our pain and for your lack of 
humanity, your lack of will to act appropriately and your lack of 
wisdom to make a difference''. Debbie Mahaffy is here in the 
gallery today with other victims to see for themselves which MP 
will defend obscenity and uphold volume discounts for the next 
Clifford Olson or Paul Bernardo. They have come in the faint hope 
that the contempt victims now expect from their MPs will not rise 
again to protect the predators who destroyed their lives.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	I ask again for the unanimous consent to declare Bill C-321 a 
votable item.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Is there consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> There is not consent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
share my frustration with the hon. member that several members, 
including the member from Erie, did not see fit to make this a 
unanimous issue.
<P>
	Politics aside, at the end of the day we must begin to try to assess 
the impact that the judicial system and the parliamentary system 
seems to be working toward. It is one of forgetting those who have 
suffered at the hands of those who do harm to many others. The 
process only allows me some four and a half minutes to speak is 
one that I would reserve for a later time to comment on.
<P>
	I begin by saying how important it is that the House hear this 
message of not giving volume discounts to serial murderers. I can 
assure the House that as long as I am a member I will continue to 
work with the hon. member for Mississauga East to make sure that 
whether this is a votable item or not, the House will have to 
consider this matter sooner or later.
<P>
	Many of us on the government side do not believe in capital 
punishment. I am one that certainly believes in that. I do not 
believe in capital punishment for a number of reasons and I 
campaigned on such. Everything else must be considered in the 
name and the sake of the victim if we are to give any consideration 
to the pain which he or she has suffered. The pain which their 
relatives, friends and loved ones will continue to have to endure for 
the rest of their lives is everything compared to the punishment of 
putting these people in a correctional facility where they belong, 
where the punishment for the crimes they have committed are 
actually served in a way that is consonant with the seriousness and 
the gravity of those crimes.
<P>
	In the short time that is given to me and to those Canadians who 
are tonight watching this debate, I say to them very solemnly that 
this Parliament will not end this evening mistreating this issue. As 
members of Parliament from right across the country we believe 
that the victim is important in the system. What the hon. member 
for Mississauga East has said before and said again this evening, 
notwithstanding the fact that the committee has not made this a 
votable item, is something that I think squares with even the most 
decent of Canadians who does not believe in capital punishment.
<P>
	Let us not categorize this as a right or left issue. Let us 
categorize this as a matter of fundamental justice, of justice that 
deals with the equity, the weight of someone's crime, and the need 
to ensure that crime is met with sufficient retribution.
<P>
	When I say retribution, it is not meant in a sense of saying 
forever and ever and that the person who is in jail should not count. 
But it is laughable when 10 people can be murdered and that 
individual only serves one life sentence. If I were to go to a grocery 
store to purchase 12 items I would have to pay for 12 items, not one 
item. What the hon. member has spoken to very eloquently is the 
need to honour the victims of violence, not those who have hate in 
their heart and would manifest that by the outward destruction of 
another life. We must ensure that there is effective punishment.
<P>
	Yes, we can talk about theories of deterrence. We can talk about 
theories of recidivism or retribution, but I do not want to get 
confounded in some ideological argument. I want to deal with the 
crisis that exists in the country today. It is a crisis based on the 
recognition that those who commit serious crimes in far too many 
instances get away with proverbial murder.
<P>
	I want to acknowledge the presence today in our gallery of 
Debbie Mahaffy, only one example. This House has an obligation 
to respect those who carry the burden of their loved ones.
<P>
<B></B>

<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	The hon. member's attempt to have Bill C-321 passed today may 
not have succeeded. However, as a young member of Parliament 
and one who believes he has a good chance of coming back after 
the next election, God willing, although I see some members 
shaking their heads over there, let me assure the House that the 
issue will come back again and again. Why? Because Canadians 
want it and because we should honour the memory of the victims of 
senseless crimes.
<P>
	Bravo to the member for Mississauga East.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I too will begin by congratulating the member for 
Mississauga East on this bill. It is evidence of her concern.
<P>
	However, I think that we must not ignore existing jurisprudence 
and legislation. There is no doubt that this sort of discourse sells 
extremely well. When particularly notorious cases are cited and we 
hear someone say: ``I, as a member of Parliament, am going to try 
to amend the act, so that an individual serves a longer sentence'', 
this goes over very well, particularly when the examples given 
have been in the headlines for weeks, if not months or years.
<P>
	While I have a great deal of compassion, I think it is necessary to 
at least look at what actually exists, both in the Criminal Code, and 
in case law. We must not pass a bill because it sells well politically, 
in order to score political points. We must do more than that, 
particularly when it comes to parole.
<P>
	I do not mean to say that the parole system is fully meeting the 
general public's expectations right now. What I am saying is that 
there should perhaps be a very serious examination of the parole 
system. Should this be done by a royal commission, or in 
committee? I really do not know, but there should certainly not be a 
piecemeal reform of the parole system.
<P>
	Although the member's intentions are good, I think that her bill 
is a piecemeal approach to reforming a system that needs a 
complete overhaul, a very close examination.
<P>
	It is a bill that is very brief, and very easy to understand. Clause 
1 of Bill C-321 states that a sentence imposed for sexual 
assault-which comes under section 271 of the Criminal 
Code-shall be served consecutively to any punishment imposed 
for an offence committed at the same time, and consecutively to 
any other sentence already being served by the person at the time of 
sentencing.
<P>
	This clause may seem rather simple at first sight. It may seem 
rather simple when first read, but its interpretation might modify 
the objectives set by the hon. member. For example, a judge 
already has powers and can, at his discretion, impose consecutive 
or concurrent sentences. Sentencing judges already have the power 
the hon. member would like to include in the Criminal Code.
<P>
	There is discretion. Certainly, it is not very attractive to defend a 
murderer, but we must not go overboard here, either. Another 
member said: ``If I go to the store and buy ten items, I have to pay 
for all ten items'', and went on to compare that situation to that of a 
person committing ten murders and being sentenced for just one. 
That argument is spurious. It is a gratuitous statement which does 
nothing to help the cause of the hon. member for Mississauga East, 
because it deflects the real debate, it exaggerates, and it is 
inappropriate in a debate of this kind.
<P>
	Let us say that someone has committed 10 murders. The judge 
has a head on his shoulders and, in sentencing a multiple murderer, 
he will take everything into account.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I am sure that you will agree with me that making 
such statements in this House only deflects the real debate and 
undermines any credibility they may have. At the present time, 
judges have the discretion to impose consecutive or concurrent 
sentences.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	Between you and me, even if a prisoner is sentenced to 255 years 
in prison, it will not make much difference in the end, because he 
will not live any longer just because he is in prison.
<P>
	Similarly, I wonder what impact this bill would have on the 
Young Offenders Act. Will the same system be used? I think Bill 
C-321 would not be applicable under the Young Offenders Act. 
And I think that may indirectly be what the hon. member wanted to 
achieve.
<P>
	Regarding clause 2, the hon. member is well intentioned, and I 
understand her position. However, her own government has 
adopted legislation along similar lines that sets similar conditions 
and is intended to extend the period of eligibility for parole. This is 
a recent bill. The official opposition even applauded the advantages 
of this bill, although we did think it was a little too much to the 
right, that it tended to respond more to demands made by the 
Reform Party than to public demand.
<P>
	As the official opposition, we nevertheless supported major 
elements of this bill. We wanted to introduce amendments, 
amendments were made, and in the end the bill was passed. But I 
do not think the government should adopt further legislation in this 
respect.
<P>
	Sure, anyone can see there are problems with the parole system. 
There are problems. Some day, the official opposition will demand 
that the government appoint a royal commission of inquiry on the 
entire parole system, especially since the Auditor General of 
Canada has raised serious doubts about public security. I think we 
could conclude that the parole system should be investigated by a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7069"> 7069 </A></B>
<P>
royal commission of inquiry, because the public's security is at 
stake.
<P>
	I hope that the members who support the hon. member's bill will 
try to convince the government when the official opposition makes 
its formal request. I hope the hon. member will rise in caucus to say 
that the Bloc Quebecois is right to ask for a royal commission of 
inquiry on the subject. A long term solution should be considered. 
We must try and find a solution today, but not in a piecemeal 
fashion, not just to respond to lobbying by people who had a very 
traumatic experience.
<P>
	I do not want to give the impression I have no compassion for 
these people. I do. I understand it must be very painful for them. 
However, we cannot base a bill on particular cases, put faces to 
victims and names to criminals. This legislation does not stand up 
in this case. There is more heart than head in it. Lawmakers must 
speak with their heads, even though I sometimes wonder where 
certain laws come from. In essence, this is the way they should be 
made.
<P>
	Yes, I understand the member's desire to have a bill passed. It is 
a cause she believes in, and I congratulate her on it. However, as 
legislation and jurisprudence currently stand, it would mean 
duplication.
<P>
	This sort of thing also raises a lot of questions, affects other 
laws, including, among others, the Young Offenders Act. What are 
the consequences for young people? We are currently looking in 
the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs at the 
approach to take on the whole matter of young offenders. Where 
would Bill C-321 fit if it were passed?
<P>
	Sincerely, I understand the member, and I can understand 
wanting to make a little political hay-we are in politics-but the 
subject matter is not appropriate to making political hay. We should 
look instead at reforming the entire parole system to some extent. 
We must not forget that there are also cases where parents have 
been closely affected by this, where someone on parole for two or 
three days comes and kills their child.
<P>
	There is the case of the Bolduc girl in Quebec. Her father is not 
advocating putting them in prison for 250 years or whatever. Quite 
the opposite. The public has to get involved. It has to come from 
the community. People do not just criticize, they want to make 
significant changes to the parole system.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	Since the government whip seems very interested, I will 
conclude by expressing my hope that, when the Bloc Quebecois 
calls on the government to appoint a royal commission on the 
parole system to settle the whole issue, it will look into this very 
seriously. I also hope the government will support the Bloc's 
request.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
honoured today to support the private member's bill by the hon. 
member for Mississauga East. This is a good bill. It is therefore 
regrettable that it has not been deemed votable.
<P>
	The member who moved this bill has given one of the most 
eloquent speeches I have ever heard made in this House. It so 
clearly described the control that the bleeding heart mentality has 
had upon the justice system for the past 25 years.
<P>
	The Liberals campaigned on a promise to give backbenchers 
more weight in this government through added private members' 
bills. By the admission of the member for Mississauga East, one of 
the Liberal's own backbenchers, this promise has been broken. The 
government backbencher accused the Liberal dominated four 
member committee that determines which private members' bills 
will be votable of short circuiting controversial bills such as this 
bill.
<P>
	The Mississauga East MP said: ``We supposedly have open 
government but we have secret committees and I would guarantee 
that no member of that committee would oppose the bill openly. 
They were just encouraged in secret. I am not suggesting it is a 
kangaroo court. It is more like a cockroach court. You cannot see 
them at work and they run''.
<P>
	The hon. member was also quoted in the <I>Hill Times</I> a couple of 
months ago as saying: ``If I had a bill on lawn care, I bet I would 
have success in getting it through the committee. If I had a bill that 
offered better treatment for criminals it would race through the 
place in a week. But if you have a bill that wants to side with the 
victims or correct an obscene injustice in our system you can 
expect resistance and many years of effort and debate''.
<P>
	I could not agree with a member more. The member made these 
comments in reference to her private member's bill on consecutive 
sentencing, Bill C-321, which was rejected by her colleagues.
<P>
	Harsher comments appeared in the <I>Hill Times</I> yesterday in 
reference to Private Members' Business. These words, which I 
would like to reiterate, are from Debbie Mahaffy, the mother of 
murder victim Leslie Mahaffy:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am disgusted but not surprised by the heartless comments on the issue of 
consecutive sentencing that came out of the flapping mouths of government Liberal 
members as recorded in your paper on November 11, ``MPs Slag Private Members' 
Business''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the Secretary of State for the Status of Women says she was not familiar with this 
serious issue for victims' families because she had not attended caucus that week and 
as a result had nothing to say. Could it be that the issue of consecutive sentencing has 
been at more caucus meetings than she? Or perhaps she simply doesn't read 
newspapers about serious issues of crime.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Another cruel remark dealing with sentencing of serial predators made by another

She named the Liberal which I am not allowed to do, but that

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-chair of the women's caucus is equally inane. Her diatribe that she might 
support consecutive sentencing if (the member for Mississauga East) brings the 
issue to the forefront again is mindless and absurd to say the least. The fact that 
she made this comment after consulting with the justice minister and the Liberal 
(member for Mississauga West) adds to the obscenity. With this calibre of 
consultants, I suggest it is time for (the member for Etobicoke-Lakeshore) to 
seek better advisers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I have omitted a small portion of Mrs. Mahaffy's letter to the 
<I>Hill Times</I> but I would like to read her last paragraph which has 
been quoted already in this House but deserves being quoted again. 
She said: ``Shame on all of you for adding to our pain and for your 
lack of humanity and the lack of wisdom to make a difference''.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	I will also read from an article which appeared on November 27 
in a B.C. newspaper regarding the justice committee's national 
forum on youth justice. For the record, I did not support the 
expenditure of $60,000 to host this meeting because I felt we would 
be going over old ground by hearing from a number of witnesses 
who had already appeared before the committee. My opposition to 
this wasteful use of taxpayers' money caused me to endure a 
berating and to have obscenities thrown at me by the chair of the 
committee.
<P>
	Nevertheless I quote from that article:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Ottawa was a bust for Chuck Cadman. Cadman, whose teenage son Jesse was 
stabbed to death by another teen four years ago, was invited to speak before the 
federal standing committee on justice affairs last weekend in Canada's capital city. 
But the Guildford dad who founded the victims rights group Crime, Responsibility 
and Youth (CRY) after his son was murdered, says the trip was a waste of time. ``I 
spoke maybe five minutes total'', he said. ``It was a joke. I shouldn't have even 
bothered going. The meeting was poorly chaired'', he charged.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Of 33 participants, Cadman said, only himself and a representative of Canadians 
Against Violence Everywhere Advocating its Termination (CAVEAT), another 
victims' rights group, spoke from the victims' perspective. The other participants 
were lawyers, criminologists and members of groups like the John Howard society, a 
group advocating convicts' rights. Everything else was geared to the rights of 
offenders Cadman said. ``I was the only person in the whole bunch who took the 
victims' side to anything'', he said, ``and someone from CAVEAT''. He said he 
appreciated being asked to attend, but added, ``it was so obviously one-sided''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It certainly is not the first time a witness or an observer has 
called the committee a bust or a sham. The mayor of Cornwall 
walked out on the committee calling it a complete waste of time 
and accusing the committee of being predisposed. I am a member 
of that committee and sometimes I cannot disagree with the 
observations of Mr. Cadman and the mayor of Cornwall.
<P>
	So far in this Parliament, 16 private members' bills have been 
introduced to reform Canada's criminal justice system. What has 
happened to the vast majority of these bills? Absolutely nothing.
<P>
	This includes Bill C-234 of the member for York 
South-Weston. This very necessary bill has not become law. It did 
not even come back to the floor of the House of Commons because 
the Liberal members of the justice committee killed it. They did 
this despite the fact that Bill C-234 has the overwhelming support 
of the Canadian Police Association, Victims of Violence, and tens 
of thousands of Canadians who have written letters and signed 
petitions.
<P>
	Bill C-234 most certainly has the support of the Reform Party 
because this private member's bill would repeal section 745 of the 
Criminal Code. It would extinguish a killer's glimmer of hope for 
being released before serving his full life sentence. It is an injustice 
that members of this House who gave life to Bill C-234 were 
denied the opportunity to dispense with or pass this most important 
private member's bill.
<P>
	It is also an injustice that the bill of the member for Mississauga 
East has not been deemed votable. This bill should become law.
<P>
	Bill C-321 provides for truth in sentencing, a true Reform 
principle. Bill C-321 provides for the imposition of consecutive 
sentences on a person who commits sexual assault and another 
offence arising out of the same event or where the person is already 
serving another sentence at the time.
<P>
	Bill C-321 should be expanded to include all offences. No one 
should get a free crime ride but that is precisely what we do in this 
country. We permit sexual offenders and other offenders to commit 
two, three or more offences and serve only one sentence as the 
other sentences are served concurrently. This is absolutely absurd.
<P>
	It is also absurd that we permit multiple murderers such as 
Clifford Olson who killed 11 children to serve only one life 
sentence when he should be serving 11 sentences. Each of the 
innocent lives he stole should be validated. Each life is worth at the 
very least a life sentence. Likewise a person who commits multiple 
crimes should be given an appropriate sentence for each and every 
crime. Bill C-321 would end this absurdity. It would put an end to 
freebie crimes in this country. Therefore I support the member and 
her bill. I support truth in sentencing.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	At this time I would ask for unanimous consent one more time 
from this House that this motion become a votable motion.

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> There is not unanimous

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
have the opportunity tonight to take part in this debate on Bill 
C-321, an act to amend the Criminal Code and the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act, cumulative sentences.
<P>
	I congratulate the hon. member for Mississauga East for 
initiative and persistence in bringing this important question to the 
attention of the House once again.
<P>
	The previous bill, Bill C-274, was debated in this Chamber on 
June 4 of this year. The subject bill has two clauses. The first would 
require judges to impose a consecutive sentence on a person 
convicted of sexual assault and another offence arising out of the 
same event or series of events or where the person is already 
serving another sentence at the time.
<P>
	The second clause would amend section 120 of the Corrections 
and Conditional Release Act by requiring offenders sentenced for 
first and second degree murder to serve their full parole 
ineligibility period on that sentence plus one-third or a maximum 
of seven years, whichever is less, for an offence arising out of the 
same event or series of events.
<P>
	For an offender already serving a sentence, when a sentence for 
murder is imposed he or she would serve one-third or seven years 
of that sentence. Offenders would be required to serve 
consecutively all of the parole ineligibility periods for sentences 
for multiple first and second degree murder convictions not arising 
out of the same series of events.
<P>
	The area of concurrent and consecutive sentences can be a 
confusing one. The power to impose a consecutive sentence must 
be found in some federal enactment. Section 718.3(4) of the 
Criminal Code discusses the circumstances where judge may direct 
that terms of imprisonment be served one after the other, that is 
consecutively.
<P>
	The code generally states that this may be done in the following 
circumstances: where a person already serving a sentence is 
convicted for a new offence and receives a sentence of 
imprisonment; where both a fine and imprisonment are imposed, 
any default time for non-payment may be consecutive; where a 
person is convicted of more than one offence in the same court at 
the same sitting and terms of imprisonment for more than one fine 
are specified, terms of imprisonment for the respective offences are 
imposed, or a combination of imprisonment and fines for separate 
offences.
<P>
	Over the years jurisprudence has developed in this area and some 
principles have become clear. Where there is no relationship 
between the separate commissions of criminal offences the court 
should, bearing in mind the total term, impose consecutive 
sentences. A second crime while in flight from a first crime should 
be punished with a consecutive sentence. Where there are a number 
of different offences committed within a short period of time, the 
offences should be grouped in categories and concurrent sentences 
imposed in respect of each offence in the same category, but 
consecutive to those imposed in respect of the other categories, 
again bearing in mind that the total term should not be excessive.
<P>
	Section 149.1 of the code provides that sentences for escape 
from custody shall be served concurrently with time being served 
or, if the court so orders, consecutively. Consecutive sentences are 
usually imposed as a deterrent, special and general to escape.
<P>
	Perhaps the distinction between concurrent and consecutive 
sentences is best summarized in the words of the 1987 report of the 
Canadian Sentencing Commission: ``Concurrent sentences 
imposed for multiple offences serve two principal functions. First, 
they permit the court to give proportionate sentences for related 
offences without disturbing the overall length of the total sentences 
imposed. Thus they counter any need to reduce sentencing 
dispositions for individual offences in order to achieve an overall 
just result. Second, concurrent sentences all serve a denunciatory 
function since their use denounces criminal conduct without 
increasing the overall sentence''.
<P>
	Generally concurrent sentences are imposed for multiple 
offences which arise out of one continuous criminal act or single 
transgression. These specific examples respecting the use of 
concurrent sentences cited by the commission are as follows: 
where an accused is convicted both of conspiracy to commit an 
offence and the substantive offence, concurrent sentences should 
be given; where goods from one theft are found in the accused's 
possession at different times, only one transaction is really 
involved and concurrent sentences should be imposed; while a 
sentence consecutive to a life term cannot be imposed because it is 
an absurdity, there is no prohibition against imposing several 
concurrent life sentences or other sentences concurrent to life.
<P>
	The sentencing commission also pointed out that the use of 
consecutive sentences has been justified on the basis of a number 
of sentencing principles. One such principle is deterrence; that is, 
consecutive sentences should be used to discourage criminal 
activity in certain circumstances, for example, for an offender who 
commits an offence while out on bail. Consecutive sentences have 
also been justified on the basis of their denunciatory effect and 
their contribution to the overall protection of the public.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7072"> 7072 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	As a general rule, consecutive sentences are imposed for 
multiple offences which arise out of separate criminal transactions. 
They thus would be imposed for a string of offence, situations 
where, again in the words of the Canadian Sentencing Commission, 
several offences arising out of separate transactions are disposed of 
before the same court at the same time. For example, the court may 
decide to impose consecutive sentences where the offender is being 
sentenced at one time for breaking and entering a dwelling house, 
robbery and assault, all of which were committed on different days.
<P>
	Parliament has recently dealt with the issue of consecutive 
sentences in chapter 22 of the Statutes of Canada, formerly Bill 
C-41, which came into force on September 3 of this year. Section 
718.3(4)(a) confirms that a consecutive sentence may be imposed 
where the accused is convicted while under sentence for another 
offence. This deals with the second part of the first clause of Bill 
C-321.
<P>
	Section 718.3(4)(c)(ii) allows a court to impose a consecutive 
sentence where an accused is convicted of more than one offence 
by that court. This would deal with the situation contemplated in 
the first part of clause 1 of the bill.
<P>
	I realize that the exercise of this power is discretionary and not 
mandatory, as would be the case were this bill to be approved. The 
approach in Canada to date is not to fetter that discretion but to 
allow judges to balance all the factors before them.
<P>
	I would also draw the attention of the House to section 7l8.2(c) 
of the Criminal Code which confirms the totality principle 
developed in the case law that where consecutive sentences are 
imposed, the combined sentences should not be unduly long or 
harsh.
<P>
	With respect to clause 2 of the bill, I am informed that the case 
law is clear that a fixed sentence cannot be made consecutive to a 
sentence of life imprisonment and that any sentence imposed after 
a sentence of life imprisonment has been imposed can only be 
concurrent to it. The authority for that is the Crown v. Sinclair for a 
1972 report on Canadian criminal cases.
<P>
	A life sentence is just that, a life sentence. The convicted person 
may get parole but will continue to be subject to the life sentence 
literally for the rest of his life and may be reincarcerated after 
having been released on parole if the person does not comply with 
the conditions of release.
<P>
	Accordingly, having consecutive life sentences is, to some 
extent, a contradiction in terms. However, the fact that numerous 
life sentences have been imposed on someone is taken into account 
in the decision to grant parole or not; a very important 
consideration.
<P>
	Let me conclude my remarks by mentioning some non-legal 
considerations of interest. Few Canadians realize that we 
incarcerate offenders in this country at a rate far higher than most 
countries in the western world.
<P>
	According to international statistics compiled by the Council of 
Europe, Canada's incarceration rate of 130 inmates per 100,000 
total population is fourth in the democratic world after the United 
States, Russia and South Africa. We are well ahead of our European 
and Australian trading partners. Let me give the House a few 
examples. The United Kingdom rate is 92 per 100,000; Australia, 
85; Germany, 81; Norway, 60; Holland, 51.
<P>
	When federal, provincial and territorial ministers met in Victoria 
in January 1995 an item for discussion was the rapid and relentless 
growth of correctional workloads, particularly prison populations, 
that all jurisdictions are experiencing.
<P>
	From 1989 to 1994-95 the federal penitentiary population grew 
by 22 per cent and provincial prison populations grew by 12 per 
cent on average.
<P>
	Notwithstanding a decline in the reported crime rate over the 
past three years, there are indications that federally there have been 
fewer conditional releases granted and more revocations of 
conditional release resulting in more time being served by more 
offenders. In addition, there has been significant growth in the 
proportion of offenders serving sentences for violent offences, 
including homicide.
<P>
	At the provincial and territorial levels of the system more 
custodial sentences are being given and for longer periods of time. 
There has been significant growth in charges for sexual and other 
assaults.
<P>
	Among the reasons for the increased offender population are 
more challenging offenders, such as sex offenders and violent 
offenders, growing accumulation of lifers in the inmate population, 
growing use of Corrections and Conditional Release Act detention 
provisions, fewer offenders on conditional release, new and harsher 
measures for more serious offences such as the four year minimum 
sentences for use of firearms.
<P>
	Correctional Services Canada now double bunks approximately 
25 per cent of inmates, and concern about the high rate of 
incarceration and double bunking has been expressed by the 
correctional investigator, the auditor general and other interested 
parties.
<P>
	Both the Solicitor General of Canada and the Minister of Justice 
have spoken publicly about the need to continue to work with the 
provinces and territories to develop strategies to contain the rate of 
growth of the inmate population. We must do this but we must also 
balance this with the protection of the public.
<P>
	I do have concerns that Bill C-321 would contribute further to 
this correctional overpopulation. I question whether we wish to 
follow the American example of building more prisons, often at the 
cost of underfunding health, education and social programs. This is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7073"> 7073 </A></B>
<P>
a sincere concern. The record shows that all levels of government 
are cutting back where the need is most: health, education and 
social programs.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	The American experience suggests that a more punitive 
approach to criminal behaviour does not, of itself, increase public 
protection or reduce levels of crime. Between 1984 and 1989 the 
American crime rate rose by 14 per cent but the prison population 
increased by 58 per cent. Today more than 1.5 million Americans 
are incarcerated. In fact, there are more Americans under criminal 
justice system supervision than there are U.S. college students.
<P>
	With respect, I do not think we have much that is useful to learn 
from criminal justice policy in the United States and, in particular, 
from its use of consecutive life sentences.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak to Bill 
C-321. I congratulate my colleague, the hon. member for 
Mississauga East, for introducing this legislation.
<P>
	I support the legislation. I know the people of 
Guelph-Wellington do as well.
<P>
	On April 9 of this year I wrote to the Prime Minister and the 
Minister of Justice and asked that they consider allowing 
consecutive sentencing for violent crimes. I believe that 
consecutive sentencing is an important step in our efforts to give a 
strong message that we as a government and we as a society will 
not tolerate violent crimes.
<P>
	In my letter I said that we owe a service to the victims of violent 
crime and their families in considering amendments to the 
Criminal Code and the Corrections and Conditional Release Act 
which will change concurrent sentences to consecutive.
<P>
	While nothing we can do as a government, as individuals or as a 
society as a whole can change or alleviate the pain and suffering 
caused by violent crime, legislation like Bill C-321 can offer some 
support.
<P>
	Victims are often, if not always, targeted because of nothing 
more than who they are. A victim may be attacked because she is a 
woman. A victim may be a young person. They may be a senior or 
a store clerk. Victims do not have the choice of whether or not to be 
targeted. They are chosen and they and their families must live with 
the results of the violent act for the rest of their lives.
<P>
	For this reason I recently introduced Bill C-344, which would 
mean no early parole for those who murder a peace officer. Like the 
hon. member for Mississauga East, I am concerned about the use of 
section 745. I would  prefer its repeal. However, in the absence of 
repealing section 745, I believe that bills such as mine and this one 
are important and necessary.
<P>
	Discussion on legislation such as this is also a good time to look 
around our community, communities like mine of 
Guelph-Wellington, and find ways that we can help eliminate or 
reduce some of the causes of crime. These causes are not someone 
else's responsibility. We each owe ourselves, our families and our 
neighbours the opportunity to effect change.
<P>
	The people of Guelph-Wellington are asking their federal 
government to do what it can to effect that change. I believe that 
passing Bill C-321 is one way to respond to their request.
<P>
	Some have argued that consecutive sentencing does not make 
sense. They argue that giving someone a prison sentence of three 
life sentences or 400 years does not help to address the problems of 
crime and punishment. I disagree. I disagree for the sake of the 
victims and their families.
<P>
	Currently people like Sharon Rosenfeldt and her husband, whose 
16-year old son Daryn was killed in 1981 by Clifford Olson, must 
face the fact that he is eligible to apply for early parole under 
section 745. Victims and their families find some comfort in the 
knowledge that the offender will be serving 25 years before he or 
she is eligible for parole. We can only imagine their suffering and 
pain when they realize that 25 years means 15 years. For Sharon 
and her family, it means they are faced with reliving the pain, the 
sense of loss, the anger and all the other emotions because they 
were unaware that the offender could seek early parole.
<P>
	Thankfully, people like Sharon have turned that dreadful event 
of her son's murder to some good. While Daryn's death can never 
be understood she and her husband have founded Victims of 
Violence, which continues to raise awareness on issues like section 
745, and to help other families cope with the death of a loved one.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	All across Canada people cope with the effects of crime. 
Whether a house or an apartment has been vandalized by thieves, 
the family car stolen from the parking lot, or a young woman has 
been sexually assaulted, we know that crime must be punished.
<P>
	There are individuals convicted of crimes that are rehabilitated. 
Many make a return to society and contribute to making Canada 
great. I welcome the opportunity to give these people a second 
chance. But there are certain crimes that we cannot tolerate, certain 
actions which must be punished to the full extent of the law and 
certain individuals who cannot return to live freely in our society. 
We can never allow crimes like murder, sexual assault and 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7074"> 7074 </A></B>
<P>
attempted murder to be  dismissed. It is because of them that Bill 
C-321 is necessary.
<P>
	Every day in Guelph-Wellington heroes go about their work. 
These heroes include in a special way our police officers, but they 
also include those who answer the phone at a sexual assault hotline, 
volunteers at the Guelph Distress Centre, teachers, factory workers, 
executives and children who take the time to make a difference. 
These heroes make that difference by caring. They know that no 
matter what the government does, crime will still occur. They are 
not asking for the impossible but they need our help to continue 
their important work.
<P>
	How can we help? We can help them by passing legislation that 
gives one clear message: &quot;We do not accept what you have done 
and you will spend a very long time, possibly the rest of your life, 
in prison''.
<P>
	Bill C-321 reminds all of us of our responsibility to fight crime. 
Whether it be as simple as making sure our neighbour does not 
walk alone to church or joining Block Parents, volunteering to 
coach baseball, helping someone who is illiterate, or watching out 
for a neighbour's house while that neighbour is away on vacation, 
we can and we must work together to help reduce crime in our 
communities.
<P>
	We each have a responsibility to one another as citizens of the 
greatest country on earth to make our communities safer. 
Government continues to have an obligation to its citizens, to offer 
them a justice system that says no to crime and serves notice that 
those who commit crimes will be adequately and in some cases, 
yes, severely punished.
<P>
	This is why Bill C-321 deserves the support of this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of order. The House has a 
procedure whereby bills are deemed to be votable by committee 
and I respect that process. I will not make a motion to that effect.
<P>
	However, I understand there is a precedent that the subject 
matter of a bill could be referred to committee with the unanimous 
consent of the House. In view of the interest of the House on the 
issue of concurrent versus consecutive sentencing, that this would 
be a worthy item.
<P>
	Therefore, I would move that the subject matter of this bill be 
referred to committee.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The House has heard the 
terms of the motion proposed by the hon. member for Mississauga 
South. Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the 
House to move the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> There is not unanimous 
consent.

	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Moncton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak for a moment or two about a question which I asked the 
Minister of Natural Resources on November 6. It concerns forestry 
practices and the issue of forest certification.
<P>
<B>(1850)</B>
<P>
	At first blush, I am sure members would think this is not that 
important an issue. However, as we look at our history and our 
country we realize that Canada is a forest nation. We possess over 
10 per cent of the world's forests, forests which provide habitat for 
a wide variety of wildlife, forests that are places for citizens of 
Canada to visit in their leisure time and forests that are important 
parts of our social and cultural history. For many people, forests are 
synonymous with Canada.
<P>
	On the economic side, the Canadian forest industry is one of 
Canada's largest and, accordingly, most important industries. It 
provides for one in fifteen jobs. It produces exports which are by 
far the single largest contributor to Canada's positive trade balance.
<P>
	Forests and forest industries are found in every province and are 
critically important to every Canadian. Sometimes we do not stop 
to think about it but even as we look around the Chamber, the 
contribution that the forestry industry makes to the beauty and 
enhancement of this Chamber becomes evident.
<P>
	As a trading nation, we need access to foreign markets. In the 
world we live in we also need to demonstrate to our customers that 
we are good custodians of our forests.
<P>
	The question of sustainable forest management is paramount to 
Canadian interests. Our ability to manage our forests in a 
sustainable manner for all of their benefits is important for every 
Canadian. I know that provinces are continually reviewing and 
upgrading their forest policies to achieve sustainable forestry and it 
is ultimately their responsibility under the British North America 
Act to manage the forests because they are a provincial 
responsibil-
<P>

<B><A NAME="7075"> 7075 </A></B>
<P>
ity. I also know that Canadian industry has made great strides in 
improving the standards of forest management in Canada.
<P>
	I would like to ask the minister, through the parliamentary 
secretary, why it is that Canada continues to be criticized for its 
forest management practices. I understand that the Canadian forest 
industry has been active in developing a standard for certification 
of Canadian forest practices. What will the impact of forest 
certification be on the sustainable forest management in Canada? 
Will certification move Canada toward achieving sustainable 
forestry and will it help the Canadian forest industry to be more 
competitive in world markets?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the question of 
sustainable forest management is one of the most important 
challenges facing Canadians.
<P>
	It is fair to say that people from around the world are asking that 
the global forest be managed in such a way that the whole array of 
social, economic and environmental values associated with forests 
are protected. In Canada this is a major priority for governments, 
industry and our citizens.
<P>
	At a recent meeting of the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers, 
we confirmed again our commitment to sustainable forest 
management. Ministers agreed to adopt a Canadian criteria and 
indicators as a means to monitor sustainable forestry. We agreed 
that the national forest strategy be renewed.
<P>
	At the international level, we have been working hard to ensure 
that the principles of sustainable forestry are promoted in the 
discussions on global forests. Recognizing the need to manage 
forests on a sustainable basis, the Canadian forestry industry has 
also been promoting sustainable forest management through the 
development by the Canadian Standards Association of a 
sustainable forest management standard. This standard has been 
approved by the Standards Council of Canada. It is now available 
to Canadian companies that wish to seek certification that they 
have a process to ensure sustainable forest management.
<P>
	They have taken the initiative outside of government to promote 
sustainable forest management. Forest certification provides a 
transparent, scientifically based and inclusive approach for 
industry to demonstrate its commitment to and practice of 
sustainable forestry.
<P>
	The Canadian industry is a world leader in this regard. It has led 
an international industrial group in approaching the International 
Standards Organization, seeking access for companies who wish to 
be certified under the environmental management standard 
provision of the ISO. This is an additional step toward a better 
standard of forestry in Canada, increasing the confidence that
